That’s why.They said the metal was too thick for normal tin openers to cut through and often only scraped the surface.Many broke their tin openers while tackling the tin – and some fed up customers said they even resorted to using hammers, screwdrivers and chisels.They said the metal was too thick for normal tin openers to cut through and often only scraped the surface. (Picture: Pembo362 YouTube)Customers have long complained getting the lid off can be hit and miss.One YouTuber called Bill Kidgell, who was filmed smashing a screw driver into the tin with a hammer in a bid to open it, jokes: ‘It’s quite easy when you know how.And another YouTuber called Charlie posted a video of himself smashing the tin open with a big knife with the message: ‘Tin opener wouldn’t open so used the biggest chef’s knife I had and a hammer. lol.’Student blogger Pembo362 posted a video claiming: ‘This thing does not open.‘It is official, after three years of having this pie under my bed in my emergency food box it’s going in the bin.’It offered a link to the recommended opener which retails at £8.50 – seven times the cost of the common metal tin openers and four times as much as a classic Fray Bentos steak and kidney pie.Pie fans were still unhappy and Fray Bentos has now said it is putting the iconic tin under the design microscope in a bid to ‘improve openability’.Pie fans were still unhappy and Fray Bentos has now said it is putting the iconic tin under the design microscope in a bid to ‘improve openability’. (Picture: Bill Kidgell YouTube)A spokesperson for Baxters Food Group said: ‘Since Baxters Food Group acquired Fray Bentos six years ago, we have worked closely with Crown Packaging (the Fray Bentos pie can manufacturers) to improve the openability of the can without compromising the integrity or quality of the Fray Bentos product.‘Based on consumer feedback the focus has been on improving the tin profile (ridges on the lid).‘We have conducted a number of trials, and while we have managed a slight improvement, we have concluded that the cans require a robust ‘cut from the top’ opener rather than a ‘cut from the side’ opener.‘Budget tin openers will not deliver consistent results.‘Moving to a ring pull lid has been considered, however due to the surface area and force required to lift the lid, this may result in serious injury to the consumer.‘This has been discounted as a potential solution.‘Whilst we continue to review the design of our can, based on consumer feedback we would strongly advise our consumers to use a robust can opener.‘We are in the process of updating this on our packaging. We have updated our website to reflect this recommendation.’Fray Bentos tinned steak and kidney pies first hit supermarket shelves in 1961."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_12197208.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"pet dog was actually a black bear and now weighs 250lbs","story":"A Chinese family raised their pet dog for two years before discovering that it was actually a black bear.Su Yun from Kunming in the Yunnan province thought she bought a Tibetan mastiff puppy but grew suspicious when the animal started walking on two legs.Now a fully grown black bear, the ‘pet’ weighs 250lbs.Ms Yun told China News: ‘The more he grew, the more like a bear he looked.’She added: ‘I’m a little scared of bears.’But were surprise to discover that the ‘pet’ grew into a huge black bear (Picture: Pear Video)The family bought the pet while on holiday in 2016.The animal has been identified as an endangered Asiatic Black Bear, which would have been sold for thousands on the black market.Toddler takes a pee as his mother\u0027s boyfriend proposes to herStaff were so intimidated by the animal, who can be seen in the video standing over 3ft tall, that they sedated it before transporting it from the family’s home.MORE: This is why throwing sticks for dogs can be fatalMORE: 37 Palestinian protesters killed as Donald Trump hails US Embassy move to Jerusalem"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sei_12148308.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"pope sold 198mph lamborghini 615000","story":"The car sold for an eye-watering £615,000 at auction (Picture: RM Sotheby’sSWNS)A Lamborghini supercar owned by Pope Francis has been sold for nearly four times its original asking price.The 198mph two-seater Hurrican, which would typically be worth around £155,000, was donated to the Pope in November last year.So he decided to sell it and donated the proceeds to charitable causes – but only after he signed and blessed the bonnet.The car was entered into RM Sotheby’s Monte Carlo sale over the weekend, where it ended-up selling for an eye-watering £615,000.But the Pope didn’t have much use for such a powerful car (Picture: RM Sotheby’sSWNS)The Iraqi city of Nineveh, which was besieged by ISIS, will get £430,000 from the sale, with the remaining £185,000 split equally among three other charities.RM Sotheby’s described the Lamborghini as being in ‘as-new condition’ having remained in static storage since it was built late last year.It has been fitted with 20-inch alloy wheels and has leather seats and features as 5.2-litre V10 engine which generates a staggering 570bhp.This gives the Italian supercar a 0-62mph time of 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 198mph.The car has been personally signed by the Pope (Picture: RiptideRM Sotheby’sSWNS)Augustin Sabatié-Garat, auction manager, RM Sotheby’s Europe, said: ‘We are honoured to have hosted such a hotly contested bidding war for this unique Lamborghini Huracan.‘We give thanks to His Holiness Pope Francis for donating the sale fee to charity, and for Automobili Lamborghini for gifting the car, as we are pleased to have played a part in sourcing money for good causes.‘The fact that this car sold for nearly three times’ worth its estimate, and much higher than the model’s standard retail price, is telling of how much interest it attracted.’MORE: Theresa May pays tribute to Tessa Jowell’s ‘compassion and determination’MORE: ‘Drugged-up’ dad ‘abandoned naked baby in forest prowled by bears and bobcats’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/15/4C2D1CC100000578-5721671-R_B_singer_R_Kelly_delivered_a_raunchy_performance_for_a_crowd_o-m-18_1526222121932.jpg","title":"Apple wont promote R Kelly music featured playlists","story":"The 51-year-old began performing in the 80s and made his official debut in 1992 with the group Public Announcement.

They have been published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.          1. Photographer Jeff Rayner, camera slung over his shoulder, arrives at the Omega internet cafe at 9.50am on March 27 with Thomas Markle          2. The photographer scans the computer booths for the best viewpoint as Mr Markle heads to the front counter to pay to get online  3. Mr Markle and the photographer book time to use one of the computers, but are secretly planning to choreograph a photoshootIn all of them Mr Markle appears to be unaware they are being taken. But we can today reveal they were in fact contrived and shot with his co-operation. It is not known if he was paid to take part.The faked images include Mr Markle apparently:Being measured for a suit to wear to the wedding – in fact the ‘tailor’ was an assistant at a party goods shop recruited for the job as the suit hire store the photographer planned to use was closed.Being caught browsing a book of British landmarks in a branch of Starbucks – although he actually arrived at the cafe with the photographer, and set up the shot.Working out with weights to get in shape for the big day – but the pictures appear to have been taken on a waste tip, an unlikely place to exercise but away from prying eyes.The revelation that Mr Markle has been co-operating with a paparazzo behind the backs of his daughter, Prince Harry and Kensington Palace officials will cause huge embarrassment to the Royal Family in the run-up to the wedding. It will be galling for Harry who, in a BBC documentary last year, hit out at the paparazzi for the way in which they pursued his mother, Princess Diana. She was killed in Paris in 1997 after being chased by photographers.And shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, the Prince made a heartfelt plea for the media to respect the privacy of Meghan and her family.Last night, just hours ahead of our exposé, represenatives of Mr Markle wrote to editors around the world and to British newspaper watchdog the Independent Press Standards Organisation. Editors were told that he was suffering as a result of media intrusion and did not want to participate in photocalls or interviews.          4. In this grainy image, the figure of Mr Markle sitting at a desk in front of a computer screen can just about be made out, while behind him Rayner uses his long lens to capture pictures he later sells for sizeable fees          5.

The letter urged editors not to publish pictures of Mr Markle and called on them to stop pursuing him.Mail on Sunday reporters have established that Mr Markle and Rayner, a 44-year-old Los Angeles-based photographer, set up at least four photoshoots.

Each morsel has been crafted to be consumed in just two delicate bites.The Queen is officially hosting the event and Buckingham Palace staff revealed that the menu would comprise ‘classic dishes’ made from seasonal British produce, much from the monarch’s own estates.Harry and his bride-to-be have tasted and selected their wedding reception menu.The couple apparently visited Windsor Castle to sample menu suggestions in the Great Kitchen, which dates from the reign of the 14th century monarch Edward III.It is believed to be the oldest working kitchen in the country, having served more than 30 monarchs.Royal chef Mark Flanagan is leading the 30-strong catering team and said: ‘The day of the wedding has fallen very kindly for us.‘All the British vegetables are just coming into season... and that’s been a point of focus for us.\u0027We know the couple wanted us to make sure we used all of the local seasonal produce as much as possible throughout their menu, and this recent good weather is really helping us to achieve that.’He added the couple have ‘been involved in every detail’.Meghan is a keen ‘foodie’ who used to run her own lifestyle website, which featured her favourite recipes and restaurants. She also shares a love of organic produce with her future father-in-law, Prince Charles.Mr Flanagan would not discuss the dishes in detail but produce such as asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season, providing a wealth of options for the chef, who has worked with some of the world’s best, including Michel and Albert Roux.He added: ‘There’s no experimentation on Saturday whatsoever, tried and tested and predominantly classics.’ Over the next few days staff will start washing and peeling vegetables, so they can save time for presentation, Mr Flanagan said.A separate dinner for 200 is being held at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales later in the evening.Miami cop beats 14-year-old daughter in school officeFinal moments of Malaysia Airline MH370 to be revealedFootage of people running away from knifeman in ParisShocking moment of teacher body slamming a student during classFisherman airlifted to hospital after shark attack in CornwallMiliband: Hardest Brexit is \u0027holding negotiators to ransom\u0027Shocking footage shows MASS brawl breaking out at AscotDaredevil captures lava bombs hurtling through the airLook inside luxury hotel where Prince Harry will stay before weddingTown of Windsor gets ready for the upcoming Royal Wedding"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/13/4C3796D700000578-5726413-The_Duchess_of_Cornwall_has_previously_told_how_she_couldn_t_bea-a-35_1526301206648.jpg","title":"Ministers urged stop making excuses civil partnerships couples","story":"Rebecca Steinfeld, 37, and Charles Keidan, 41, (pictured today) want a legal union through that route but are prevented because the Civil Partnership Act 2004 says only same-sex couples are eligible A panel of five Supreme Court justices, including the court\u0027s president Lady Hale, began considering the couple\u0027s appeal on Monday.  Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan, who have two daughters aged two and eight months, claim the Government\u0027s position is \u0027incompatible with equality law\u0027.In a statement outside court ahead of the hearing, Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan said: \u0027Throughout our campaign we have met hundreds of couples like us who love each other and want a civil partnership so they can celebrate their commitment and strengthen the security of their family unit.\u0027Their reasons for not wanting to marry vary from bad personal experiences to expense to conscience – but that doesn\u0027t matter.\u0027All they want is the choice of marriage or a civil partnership to suit them, which is currently available only to same-sex couples.\u0027We have a new Equalities Minister and she should take this opportunity to look afresh at the Government\u0027s position.\u0027It\u0027s time for the Government to stop making excuses which play with people\u0027s lives, and give choice to all now.\u0027David Miliband is branded a \u0027wrecker who doesn\u0027t even live...May invites EVERY Tory MP for private talks amid desperate...Share this article    Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, a couple with two young children, are fighting for the right to enter a civil partnership instead of getting married  Steinfeld and Keidan (right) said they favour the union over marriage. Tim Loughton (left), the MP who looked to extend civil partnerships to heterosexuals, said: ‘There is absolutely no excuse why the government is not getting on with it and equalising civil partnerships\u0027The Court of Appeal agreed the couple had established a potential violation of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which relates to discrimination, taken with Article 8, which refers to respect for private and family life.But, by a majority of two to one, the judges said the interference was justified by the Government\u0027s policy of \u0027wait and evaluate\u0027.          Human right campaigner, Peter Tatchell shows his support for the couple\u0027s cause  They heard the couple have deep-rooted and genuine ideological objections to marriage and wish to enter into a legally regulated relationship which does not carry \u0027patriarchal baggage\u0027.The Government said it was decided, after public consultations and debate in Parliament, not to extend civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples, abolish them or phase them out at that stage.The aim was to see how extending marriage to same-sex couples impacted on civil partnerships before making a final decision which, if reversed in a few years\u0027 time, would be disruptive, unnecessary and extremely expensive.The couple are expected to make a direct appeal to the Government to support the extension of civil partnerships to all.Speaking before the hearing, LGBT and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: \u0027It\u0027s time for \u0027straight\u0027 equality.\u0027The ban on opposite-sex civil partnerships is discrimination and a violation of human rights.\u0027It is outrageous that the Government is unwilling to legislate equality and that this couple are forced to go to court to get a basic human right – the right to be treated equally in law.\u0027It cannot be fair that same-sex couples now have two options, civil partnerships and civil marriages, whereas opposite-sex partners have only one option, marriage.\u0027The hearing is expected to last two days."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/11/17/4C1A45A800000578-0-image-m-24_1526055185140.jpg","title":"Ecuador foreign minister working UK resolve Assange situation","story":"    María Fernanda Espinosa, foreign minister of Ecuador, has said she is working with the UK and a \u0027team of lawyers\u0027 to \u0027resolve\u0027 Julian Assange\u0027s stay in the London embassyIn remarks quoted by Spanish news agency Agencia EFE, she said Ecuador was in \u0027constant communication\u0027 with the United Kingdom and a \u0027team of lawyers\u0027.\u0027We are looking for an exit, but that exit has to be framed within the international law of human rights,\u0027 she said.Asylum seeker killed sex worker two months after he was due...\u0027I still get nightmares\u0027: Wife of Libyan dissident reveals...Share this articleThe Wikileaks founder has been holed up in the Knightsbridge embassy since 2012 following attempt to extradite him to Sweden amid rape and sexual assault allegations. Assange, who helped leak of tens of thousands of US diplomatic cables that year, denied the claims and said they were politically motivated.Swedish prosecutors have since  dropped their investigation into allegations against Assange, but he fears he will be extradited to the United States if he leaves.

I was so shocked at what was happening. I just said \u0027it\u0027s dead, this baby is going to die\u0027. I was so shocked.\u0027\u0027          Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labourThe hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 as the unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated.It can be 10cm fully dilated.Dr Siddiki told the Manchester tribunal: \u0027I remember 3cm dilation being said and I saw Dr Laxman go to examine her but I don\u0027t know what she was doing. \u0027I believe she was examining the patient to confirm the findings but she didn\u0027t tell me why she was examining the patient. \u0027She could not comment on what she was doing but another doctor told me they were not considering a Caesarean section. All I heard Dr Laxman say to the patient was \u0027I\u0027m going to examine you\u0027.\u0027If she was fully dilated, the baby could be delivered vaginally but she never communicated with the patient about doing a vaginal delivery. I never got the information that she was going to do that. I\u0027m not sure what she was doing.Premature baby was DECAPITATED inside his mother\u0027s womb...Share this article\u0027We were set up for a c-section, she had a prolapsed cord and she was 25 plus 6 weeks gestated. I was under the impression we were going to do a c-section and this caused us a delay - I didn\u0027t know what she was planning.\u0027I said \u0027are you not going for a section\u0027 and all she said was \u0027I know that\u0027. I don\u0027t know what the plan was in her mind. After that I saw the feet coming out of the vagina. I admit I didn\u0027t tell her to stop and I saw her pull on the legs.\u0027The patient was pushing the baby and the baby was being delivered by traction. It was repeated pulls and traction and it lasted for approximately 15-20 minutes.\u0027I wanted to look for any foetal abnormality but Dr Laxman was encouraging the patient to push and she was pulling the baby down. This was not what I was expecting.           Dr Vaishnavy Laxman outside her MPTS tribunal hearing at the GMC in Manchester\u0027If she was only at 3cm it would have been right for her to have a c-section. I just said \u0027this baby is dead now\u0027 I was so shocked. I didn\u0027t express this to Dr Laxman.\u0027I had no confirmation of this as I wasn\u0027t stood near to see, but I just knew. The baby\u0027s heartbeat had dropped. I saw the baby\u0027s legs coming out of the vagina, then she delivered up to the chest, it happened very quickly.\u0027Dr Laxman said to the patient \u0027give me a good push\u0027 and there was repeated pulling on the legs and body. Sometimes the shoulders are tricky to deliver as the arms can get stuck and it can be heard to get out.\u0027The information of her consultation was that she was not properly dilated but it was hard to know how hard this was to get the baby out. There was two attempts made by Dr Laxman to cut the cervix but I didn\u0027t know what she was doing.\u0027Laxman who faces being struck off denies contributing to the death of the baby. Lawyers for the General Medical Council said she should have performed a Caesarean instead of a natural delivery arguing a \u0027fragile\u0027 baby like the infant who died would suffer \u0027a lot more damage if pulled or twisted\u0027.The hearing continues.     "},{"url":null,"title":"Who Tiger Woodss girlfriend Erica Herman revealed","story":"Deadpool\u0027s Ryan Reynolds went on King of Mask Singer as a unicorn and killed itPornhub\u0027s socks advert takes on Under Armour with suggestive taglines and metaphorsKFC create a Royal Wedding Bucket for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0027s big dayWhen is Whitsun 2018, what is Pentecost and when is the next Bank Holiday in the UK?Adidas under investigation over worker\u0027s injury at Kanye West\u0027s Yeezy officeGoosebumps sequel Horrorland: All you need to knowRihanna responds to question about whether she\u0027s going to the Royal Wedding in the best way possible Bulletproof: All you need to know about Noel Clarke and Ashley Walters\u0027s new showWho is Tasha Reign?

She’s clearly forgotten her roots and her family.‘There’s a whole different side to her that has started to surface and it’s ugly to see.‘I’ve read that Meg wants to be like Diana. Diana was worshipped by everyone in the world. She was loved for the right reasons.‘That’s what Meg wants to happen, but I don’t think it’s going to happen. She’s not genuine like Diana.’ Markle Junior, a father-of-two who was last year arrested after a domestic incident with his fiancée, which saw him accused of drunkenly pulling a gun on her, has not spoken to Miss Markle for seven years but says he still would have expected an invitation to her wedding.He seizes on the fact that 600 guests have been invited to attend the wedding at St George’s Chapel in May 19, and a further 2,500 member of the public to watch proceedings from the Windsor Castle grounds.‘She’s forgotten her flesh and blood,’ he told the newspaper.           Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on Saturday, May 19, in WindsorOh deer!

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will not have a sitdown wedding breakfast after their ceremony on Saturday – but have plumped for trendy ‘bowl food’ instead            The Royal Kitchen at Windsor Castle has begun preparations for the wedding banquet    Pictured the Royal Palaces Head chef Mark Flanagan (right) and the Royal Palaces Pastry chef Selwyn Stoby (left)Still, Harry and Meghan hope that it will make the occasion less fussy and allow them to move around the room greeting as many guests as possible.Guests will also feast on canapes during the lunchtime reception, which will last around two and a half hours and includes speeches and cutting of the cake. Each morsel has been crafted to be consumed in just two delicate bites.The Queen is officially hosting the event and Buckingham Palace staff revealed that the menu would comprise ‘classic dishes’ made from seasonal British produce, much from the monarch’s own estates.Harry and his bride-to-be have tasted and selected their wedding reception menu.The couple apparently visited Windsor Castle to sample menu suggestions in the Great Kitchen, which dates from the reign of the 14th century monarch Edward III.It is believed to be the oldest working kitchen in the country, having served more than 30 monarchs.Royal chef Mark Flanagan is leading the 30-strong catering team and said: ‘The day of the wedding has fallen very kindly for us.‘All the British vegetables are just coming into season... and that’s been a point of focus for us.\u0027We know the couple wanted us to make sure we used all of the local seasonal produce as much as possible throughout their menu, and this recent good weather is really helping us to achieve that.’He added the couple have ‘been involved in every detail’.Meghan is a keen ‘foodie’ who used to run her own lifestyle website, which featured her favourite recipes and restaurants. She also shares a love of organic produce with her future father-in-law, Prince Charles.Mr Flanagan would not discuss the dishes in detail but produce such as asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season, providing a wealth of options for the chef, who has worked with some of the world’s best, including Michel and Albert Roux.He added: ‘There’s no experimentation on Saturday whatsoever, tried and tested and predominantly classics.’ Over the next few days staff will start washing and peeling vegetables, so they can save time for presentation, Mr Flanagan said.A separate dinner for 200 is being held at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales later in the evening.Miami cop beats 14-year-old daughter in school officeFinal moments of Malaysia Airline MH370 to be revealedFootage of people running away from knifeman in ParisShocking moment of teacher body slamming a student during classFisherman airlifted to hospital after shark attack in CornwallMiliband: Hardest Brexit is \u0027holding negotiators to ransom\u0027Shocking footage shows MASS brawl breaking out at AscotDaredevil captures lava bombs hurtling through the airLook inside luxury hotel where Prince Harry will stay before weddingTown of Windsor gets ready for the upcoming Royal Wedding"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/13/4C3796D700000578-5726413-The_Duchess_of_Cornwall_has_previously_told_how_she_couldn_t_bea-a-35_1526301206648.jpg","title":"Ministers urged stop making excuses civil partnerships couples","story":"Rebecca Steinfeld, 37, and Charles Keidan, 41, (pictured today) want a legal union through that route but are prevented because the Civil Partnership Act 2004 says only same-sex couples are eligible A panel of five Supreme Court justices, including the court\u0027s president Lady Hale, began considering the couple\u0027s appeal on Monday.  Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan, who have two daughters aged two and eight months, claim the Government\u0027s position is \u0027incompatible with equality law\u0027.In a statement outside court ahead of the hearing, Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan said: \u0027Throughout our campaign we have met hundreds of couples like us who love each other and want a civil partnership so they can celebrate their commitment and strengthen the security of their family unit.\u0027Their reasons for not wanting to marry vary from bad personal experiences to expense to conscience – but that doesn\u0027t matter.\u0027All they want is the choice of marriage or a civil partnership to suit them, which is currently available only to same-sex couples.\u0027We have a new Equalities Minister and she should take this opportunity to look afresh at the Government\u0027s position.\u0027It\u0027s time for the Government to stop making excuses which play with people\u0027s lives, and give choice to all now.\u0027David Miliband is branded a \u0027wrecker who doesn\u0027t even live...May invites EVERY Tory MP for private talks amid desperate...Share this article    Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, a couple with two young children, are fighting for the right to enter a civil partnership instead of getting married  Steinfeld and Keidan (right) said they favour the union over marriage. Tim Loughton (left), the MP who looked to extend civil partnerships to heterosexuals, said: ‘There is absolutely no excuse why the government is not getting on with it and equalising civil partnerships\u0027The Court of Appeal agreed the couple had established a potential violation of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which relates to discrimination, taken with Article 8, which refers to respect for private and family life.But, by a majority of two to one, the judges said the interference was justified by the Government\u0027s policy of \u0027wait and evaluate\u0027.          Human right campaigner, Peter Tatchell shows his support for the couple\u0027s cause  They heard the couple have deep-rooted and genuine ideological objections to marriage and wish to enter into a legally regulated relationship which does not carry \u0027patriarchal baggage\u0027.The Government said it was decided, after public consultations and debate in Parliament, not to extend civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples, abolish them or phase them out at that stage.The aim was to see how extending marriage to same-sex couples impacted on civil partnerships before making a final decision which, if reversed in a few years\u0027 time, would be disruptive, unnecessary and extremely expensive.The couple are expected to make a direct appeal to the Government to support the extension of civil partnerships to all.Speaking before the hearing, LGBT and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: \u0027It\u0027s time for \u0027straight\u0027 equality.\u0027The ban on opposite-sex civil partnerships is discrimination and a violation of human rights.\u0027It is outrageous that the Government is unwilling to legislate equality and that this couple are forced to go to court to get a basic human right – the right to be treated equally in law.\u0027It cannot be fair that same-sex couples now have two options, civil partnerships and civil marriages, whereas opposite-sex partners have only one option, marriage.\u0027The hearing is expected to last two days."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/11/17/4C1A45A800000578-0-image-m-24_1526055185140.jpg","title":"Ecuador foreign minister working UK resolve Assange situation","story":"    María Fernanda Espinosa, foreign minister of Ecuador, has said she is working with the UK and a \u0027team of lawyers\u0027 to \u0027resolve\u0027 Julian Assange\u0027s stay in the London embassyIn remarks quoted by Spanish news agency Agencia EFE, she said Ecuador was in \u0027constant communication\u0027 with the United Kingdom and a \u0027team of lawyers\u0027.\u0027We are looking for an exit, but that exit has to be framed within the international law of human rights,\u0027 she said.Asylum seeker killed sex worker two months after he was due...\u0027I still get nightmares\u0027: Wife of Libyan dissident reveals...Share this articleThe Wikileaks founder has been holed up in the Knightsbridge embassy since 2012 following attempt to extradite him to Sweden amid rape and sexual assault allegations. Assange, who helped leak of tens of thousands of US diplomatic cables that year, denied the claims and said they were politically motivated.Swedish prosecutors have since  dropped their investigation into allegations against Assange, but he fears he will be extradited to the United States if he leaves.

I was so shocked at what was happening. I just said \u0027it\u0027s dead, this baby is going to die\u0027. I was so shocked.\u0027\u0027          Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labourThe hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 as the unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated.It can be 10cm fully dilated.Dr Siddiki told the Manchester tribunal: \u0027I remember 3cm dilation being said and I saw Dr Laxman go to examine her but I don\u0027t know what she was doing. \u0027I believe she was examining the patient to confirm the findings but she didn\u0027t tell me why she was examining the patient. \u0027She could not comment on what she was doing but another doctor told me they were not considering a Caesarean section. All I heard Dr Laxman say to the patient was \u0027I\u0027m going to examine you\u0027.\u0027If she was fully dilated, the baby could be delivered vaginally but she never communicated with the patient about doing a vaginal delivery. I never got the information that she was going to do that. I\u0027m not sure what she was doing.Premature baby was DECAPITATED inside his mother\u0027s womb...Share this article\u0027We were set up for a c-section, she had a prolapsed cord and she was 25 plus 6 weeks gestated. I was under the impression we were going to do a c-section and this caused us a delay - I didn\u0027t know what she was planning.\u0027I said \u0027are you not going for a section\u0027 and all she said was \u0027I know that\u0027. I don\u0027t know what the plan was in her mind. After that I saw the feet coming out of the vagina. I admit I didn\u0027t tell her to stop and I saw her pull on the legs.\u0027The patient was pushing the baby and the baby was being delivered by traction. It was repeated pulls and traction and it lasted for approximately 15-20 minutes.\u0027I wanted to look for any foetal abnormality but Dr Laxman was encouraging the patient to push and she was pulling the baby down. This was not what I was expecting.           Dr Vaishnavy Laxman outside her MPTS tribunal hearing at the GMC in Manchester\u0027If she was only at 3cm it would have been right for her to have a c-section. I just said \u0027this baby is dead now\u0027 I was so shocked. I didn\u0027t express this to Dr Laxman.\u0027I had no confirmation of this as I wasn\u0027t stood near to see, but I just knew. The baby\u0027s heartbeat had dropped. I saw the baby\u0027s legs coming out of the vagina, then she delivered up to the chest, it happened very quickly.\u0027Dr Laxman said to the patient \u0027give me a good push\u0027 and there was repeated pulling on the legs and body. Sometimes the shoulders are tricky to deliver as the arms can get stuck and it can be heard to get out.\u0027The information of her consultation was that she was not properly dilated but it was hard to know how hard this was to get the baby out. There was two attempts made by Dr Laxman to cut the cervix but I didn\u0027t know what she was doing.\u0027Laxman who faces being struck off denies contributing to the death of the baby. Lawyers for the General Medical Council said she should have performed a Caesarean instead of a natural delivery arguing a \u0027fragile\u0027 baby like the infant who died would suffer \u0027a lot more damage if pulled or twisted\u0027.The hearing continues.     "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c0c7076a06ed13ca2653d01020261aa70625b32/383_0_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61eac25fc3e507a66a7f8fbe881a45ea","title":"tacita dean landscape review a total eclipse of the senses","story":"From the steaming volcanoes of Yellowstone park to the mists of Bodmin Moor, the artist’s latest riveting work is like hitching a ride with Oedipus, Antigone and ZZ TopClouds and stones and clods of light. Mountains in Austria and an ant on a rock in Mexico. Best of all, a long, slow eclipse. The final exhibition in Tacita Dean’s three-part meditation on the portrait (at the National Portrait Gallery), the still life (at the National Gallery) and now Landscape (in three rooms of the new galleries at the Royal Academy), provides a summation of interrelated themes.These are less exhibitions about genre – portraiture, still life and landscape – than they are about Dean’s ongoing relationships with people, places and things. In others words, being in the world and making sense of it, or at least telling stories and making images. As well as dwelling on presence – the atmosphere of a confrontation with another human how light hits an object and somehow makes it magical the vagaries of weather, and place, and time – Dean’s art is also much concerned with the discoveries work itself makes. Four-, five-, six-, seven- and nine-leafed clovers laid out under glass, a field of good luck whose colours are fading from exposure to light. Here are the round stones she collects as happenstance dictates, and drawings of clouds and mountains, dragged, blurred and blown on to blackboards and slates shapes and thoughts and phrases written as into the air. None of the three shows amount to a retrospective, although Dean’s filmed portraits at the National Portrait Gallery began with her first filmed portrait, of Italian arte povera sculptor Mario Merz in 2002, and her Still Life exhibition included a film from 2008. She has also been collecting round stones and clover leaves for years. Over time, everything adds up, refers back and takes a step into the future. Dean’s latest film, Antigone, has been on her mind for more than 20 years, and she wrote about it in the  in 1997, as part of the diary she kept of her residency at the Sundance Screenwriters Lab in Utah. Part of her conversation there – with Stewart Stern, screenwriter of Rebel Without a Cause, starring James Dean – has become part of the script here. As does Canadian poet (and classics scholar) Anne Carson’s 2001 poem TV Men: Antigone (Scripts 1 and 2). Carson’s poem is a retelling of Antigone as if gone over by TV executives. What is really at the heart of the film is Dean’s relationship with her elder sister, named Antigone, who appears for a few frames in this looped, double-screen 35mm film. It is impossible to do justice to this almost hour-long film, with its multiple layerings, masked exposures and multiple viewpoints, its innovative technical manipulations of analogue film and its camerawork. The film is edited in the camera itself, as was her 2011 work Film at Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall and the recent, tiny triple portrait His Portrait in Little, at the National Portrait Gallery. We go from closeups of smoking and steaming volcanic vents in Yellowstone National Park to the mists of Bodmin Moor. We visit the floodplains of the Mississippi in Wyoming, the town of Thebes, Illinois, and the courthouse where Abraham Lincoln first practiced. Here we meet Anne Carson and actor Stephen Dillane. For much of the film, Dillane is an Oedipus blinded by tinted glasses made for viewing the eclipse, and wearing a huge, straggly beard. He maunders across the world as though without purpose, at one point followed by a pair of curious dogs. As he walks out of frame, the dogs start copulating. Think ZZ Top. Think Saint Jerome. Think Harry Dean Stanton in the film Paris, Texas. A man on a mission, escaping his fate. Eagles circle the sky, their call a distant mewing. There are vultures and a crow stalks the horizon. Every moment of Antigone is a confusion, a complexity and a delight – a rich muddled stew of words and images, places and atmospheres. And through the imaginary day on which everything takes place, the sun is slowly eclipsed. At full eclipse, a black sun with a flaring corona looks back, like an eye. Colour is drained from the world and then all light. Film picks out the gradations of dying light, the last and first glimmers, and the florid corona of the eclipsed sun, to a degree and with a nuance that digital recording cannot approach. Through the film there are speeches and observations, bits of Sophocles, a parable told to Dean by Stern and snatches of Carson’s poem. It is often hard to tell where we are. Frequently, we are in several places at once. Dillane passes across the world like a cloud, his beard awry. Carson does a little dance on the courtroom steps, the zips and buckles of her leather jacket jangling with light.I can’t tell you what all this means. It is a whole world come together, splitting and parting and rejoining. Antigone is a film of origins and arrivals, incidence and coincidence and alignments, less a landscape than a world entire.• Tacita Dean: Landscape is at the Royal Academy, London, from 19 May until 12 August.

For Washington DC librarian Anna Holmes, it wasn’t so much the book, as the slice of Kraft American that she found inside it, clearly used by a cheese-loving patron as a bookmark. The library branch has seen three “cheese bookmark” incidents to date, according to Holmes, who made a plea on Twitter for readers to “PLEASE stop using cheese as a bookmark. Please. We give away actual bookmarks for free. Or like use a receipt or something. Just not perishables.”Whiffy as that sounds, that trio of dairy product delinquents are not the worst offenders, librarians across the world have revealed in response to Holmes’s plea. There are those who use banana skins, broccoli (“It was cooked and buttered well. I think the greasy stain made it easy for them to find their page”), cooked bacon and a fried chicken leg. Inedible but equally jarring fold-ins reported included Lego, flowers, money, a used condom, and a sawblade.Bacon, it turns out, appears to be a bit of a thing, with librarians previously reporting the discovery of surprise rashers all over the place. In his Salt Lake City branch, Josh Hanagarne also discovered “a lock of hair, like, the size a serial killer would take from a victim”, and “a Polaroid of a cat wearing a leather mask”.Conducting this important research also brought me to Forgotten Bookmarks, a gift of a website where used bookseller Michael Popek charts the things he finds inside the antiquarian books he buys. Some of the best include a marriage certificate dated 18 October 1899, found in an 1850 copy of the Bible, and a recipe for cheese souffle, found in Charles Darwin: Evolution and Natural Selection. But Popek’s site itself is a charming and moving glimpse into other people’s reading lives – the advertisement for a roach exterminator found in Backgrounds of American Literary Thought the family photographs left behind by previous readers the small and intriguing key found in Ocean Grove Christian Songs. Who were these readers, what did they think of these books, where are they now?As for me, I am an unabashed page turner-downer and spine-cracker of the books I own, to the horror of my husband. It’s sacrilege to many, but although I love my books, I don’t mind that they look read. And reread. And reread. They are not decoration.Library books, though – I wouldn’t dare. Receipts, hairbands, leaves – I’ve roped them all in. Never food, though. Never bacon.

A decision on FOBTs, which account for more than half of UK bookmakers’ revenues, is expected this week.The William Hill chief executive, Philip Bowcock, said: “This is a landmark moment for sports betting and for William Hill. Now, all attention shifts to the States, where steps have already been taken to prepare for this day. Legalised sports betting means that consumers and sports leagues will have greater protection, states will benefit from the raising of taxes and there is the potential for over 100,000 jobs to be created.“We welcome the ruling and expect to be operational in New Jersey as soon as responsibly possible. We are also actively working on opportunities in a number of other states and will update on these opportunities as appropriate.”Geoff Freeman, the president of the American Gaming Association (AGA), said: “Today’s decision is a victory for the millions of Americans who seek to bet on sports in a safe and regulated manner.”The AGA has argued that the law against sports betting has given rise to a huge illegal gambling industry that accepts $150bn (£110bn) in wagers a year, much of it run by organised crime gangs such as the mafia.In its ruling, the supreme court said: “Supporters argue that legalisation will produce revenue for the states and critically weaken illegal sports betting operations, which are often run by organised crime. “Opponents contend that legalising sports gambling will hook the young on gambling, encourage people of modest means to squander their savings and earnings, and corrupt professional and college sports.”However, it said it was not the supreme court’s decision to make a “policy choice”, only to decide whether PASPA was in keeping with the constitution.Gambling industry analysts said the scale of the opportunity for gambling companies would depend on how tightly inidual states decide to regulate the industry.Some states are expected to restrict sports betting to land-based casinos or racetracks, rather than permitting online bets, while others have proposed tax rates that industry figures say are unworkable.Analysts at the stockbroker Goodbody said: “It could take a number of years before we see wide-scale US sports betting and significant investment may be required to develop a meaningful business in the US.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f340cef1fe07c23809d8d8480d91d8e3d32f254f/0_81_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9e1b06a607e7f01107362b939396c91","title":"david miliband theresa may brexit tory european economic area","story":"When David Miliband fled to New York to run the International Rescue Committee, he cannot have imagined his old country would be most in need of his services. Britain now needs all the help it can get, even from superannuated expatriate politicians. By the autumn the government will have had to choose between the devil of a messy but feasible hotchpotch of soft Brexit and the deep blue sea of no deal. We can dance on the head of a pin for so long, but this year there has to be a choice.Today, at an Open Reason event in Essex, a tri-party trio of Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nicky Morgan are seeking to advance the cause of a version of the customs unionsingle market called the European Economic Area (EEA), as enjoyed by Norway. This would not reverse the referendum, an outcome futilely sought by remain fundamentalists. It would honour Brexit, while also honouring Theresa May’s claimed commitment to “frictionless” trade. Each of the “issues” – control on aspects of migration, no border in Ulster, ad hoc deals with third parties – can be accommodated, up to a point, within the terms of an EEA negotiation.May should now slam her fist on the cabinet table and say yes to Miliband, Clegg and Morgan. She should say yes to the 14 Lords amendments to the Brexit bill now returning to the Commons. She should say yes to a clear majority of her cabinet and all MPs. She should say yes to public opinion. The EEA is the one sensible and consensual compromise through this mess.Against it stands the apparently insuperable obstacle of the prime minister’s lack of guts. She is in awe of a group of diehards in her cabinet and on her backbenches.May undoubtedly faces the greatest crisis of Tory leadership in a generation, and there is no question this involves personal risk. She must rescind some of her more reckless hard-Brexit pledges. She will face the resignation of ministers and a probable leadership challenge. But it is doubtful if such a rebellion will terminally undermine her position. Leaders have faced such crises before – as did John Major when he called the bluff of a similar rebellion in 1995.Seeking a parliamentary consensus is the proper constitutional way forward. May should be able to win support this autumn for a realistic negotiating strategy in Brussels, irrespective of her party’s internal disputes. For the next year, such an outbreak of sanity could lead Britain to a new, perhaps even constructive, semi-detachment from the EU. It would serve the national interest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fee2936190af07d5eb85c5c657bd60b1a1599eb/149_0_3129_1878/master/3129.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd6add388b7ee0e02d35b1a696770a67","title":"if kindness not part of socialist vocabulary count me out suzanne moore","story":"The career of Tessa Jowell, who died last week, shows that kindness is smart, strategic – and sadly absent from public life right nowEverything I have read about Tessa Jowell mentions her kindness. Many other qualities, too: her bravery her humour her work on Sure Start. But her kindness was stellar. What a power. I use that word knowingly, since kindness in public life is often confused with weakness, a more feminised way of doing politics. The opposite is true. Kindness is smart, strategic and absolutely lacking in public life at the moment.Samuel Johnson knew it: “Kindness is in our power, even when fondness is not,” he said. Some time ago, we were going to have a kinder, gentler politics ushered in by Jeremy Corbyn. Remember that fantasy? What we have now is such a polarisation of discourse that neither kindness nor rationality can get a look-in.If you did not vote remain, you are a brain-dead, selfish git. If you do not love Momentum, you are a Tory or, worse, a Blairite. If you want to ask a few questions about gender, you are a murdering terf (trans-exclusionary radical feminist).Now we have the term “gammon” to describe angry white men. Oscar Wilde must be turning in his grave.God knows if these hammy chaps are skilled or unskilled or live in the home counties or Sunderland. They are a bad joke. I am not a psephologist, but it would be a surprise to me if Labour never again needs their votes. Persuading former Tories to vote Labour is not, apparently, what it is all about.What would I know? I do not have a socialist heritage, but a working-class, Tory-voting one. Gammon blood? This is probably why I joined the Workers Revolutionary party at 14. My family are dead – I see now that they must have died from avocado deprivation – but they were always complicated, saying things of which I disapproved but then being totally accepting of differences of sexuality or race.My friendships have never been only with those who think like me. I find it possible to hate what the Tories do yet fail to think that every Tory voter is a monster any more than I think every former steel worker or miner is a paragon of radicalism. Indeed, much of the former industrial class is way nearer gammon than these new class warriors seem to understand. Sure, I am taking a bit of banter too seriously. Maybe. But this macho, confrontational, simplistic name-calling is as redundant as the kind of masculinity at which it pokes fun.Are gammon, melts and slugs up the class scale from chavs? I thought “chav” was a class slur. But then the parts of the left that believe themselves morally pure will not see their own racism, misogyny and class snobbery. Instead, they will lead the people they disdain to the promised land.Theirs is a worldview that says: do not show kindness to those who would not show kindness to you. The essential position of leave and remain is: do not seek to understand your enemy. Instead, yell insults. You are ham. You are angry. You are wrong. This is not conversation it is road rage dressed up as analysis. Once you look down on someone, it is impossible to help them up. It is a losing game.To engage takes kindness. Kindness is not a compromise or a cop-out. Above all, kindness demands courage. If kindness is not part of socialist vocabulary, count me out and call me any damn name you like. If I am lady gammon, cook me in Coca-Cola, as Nigella recommends. Delicious.The firm really are a mean old lot, aren’t they? Inviting commoners to gawk at Harry’s do, but deigning not to feed them. And declining to invite to the private reception a woman who adds to the gaiety of the nation: the Duchess of York. Good old, bad old Fergie. Is she any better than she ought to be? No. I have loved her since 1992, when she was pictured having her toes sucked by her financial adviser in St Tropez. Yolo, Fergs!A royal aide in 1994 called her “vulgar, vulgar, vulgar”. Unlike the others, some of whom need a valet to carry around their own toilet seat. I remember being at Diana’s funeral and Fergie being the only person who made any attempt to comfort those boys.Still, she went on Oprah in 2011 and apologised, talking sadly of how completely worthless she felt and the mistakes she had made. She was not invited to Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding, although Prince Andrew and their two daughters were.This is beyond rude. The fact that she and Andrew maintain properties – and a friendship – seems not to come into it. She is persona non grata. Yes, there is the matter of selling access to her former husband for £500,000 because she was broke. He denied any involvement. But what does he do when he is not on holiday, which normally he is? He had to step down from his role as a representative for international trade and investment because he liked to hang out with Jeffrey Epstein (jailed for sex offences), a Libyan gun smuggler and a billionaire in Kazakhstan. Is there a more vulgar lifestyle than doing deals with dictatorships?In the absence of Fergie, we can only hope that Princess Beatrice does not disappoint us and outdoes the Cthulhu headwear from the most recent royal wedding. Do it, Beatrice, for your poor, ostracised mother.Never mind that millennials – and I never truly have any idea of what they are – live in debt and can’t buy houses. Something even worse is happening to them. They cannot open Fray Bentos tins. They are not sure how and have to go on YouTube with hammers and screwdrivers and all sorts of gear to get them open. This is a terrible tragedy. The slightly soggy bit of pastry under the lid of a Fray Bentos pie, where it mixes with the dog‑food-style gravy, is one of the peaks of human civilisation. Another is the tin opener. I am truly worried for the future of mankind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/232da8ce641590d0612dc30efd7f9530771ab42e/0_247_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f74168ac42ac64bd3c5f4449e73112ab","title":"jeremy corbyn wants hard brexit labour","story":"Jeremy Corbyn does not have a better plan for Brexit than Theresa May but, so far, he hasn’t needed one. After the referendum, the prime minister and the Labour leader embarked on parallel journeys, each carrying promises of painless, cost-free release from EU membership. May’s path was harder. Her pledges were snagged on governing reality, skewered by Brussels, hung up on parliamentary arithmetic. Opposition has protected Corbyn from those jagged edges, but he cannot avoid them for ever. Rebellion in the House of Lords has brought them uncomfortably close.The upper chamber has rewritten the EU withdrawal bill so it urges the government to negotiate a much softer Brexit. More than 80 Labour peers defied their whips to support membership of the European Economic Area, thereby preserving British integration in the single market. There are MPs from all parties who will want to endorse that amendment when it comes back to the Commons. They see the EEA as the least-damaging Brexit model: a safety net for jobs and investment.At a factory in Essex today, three political grandees gathered to make that argument: David Miliband, former Labour foreign secretary Nick Clegg, former Liberal Democrat leader and Nicky Morgan, Tory chair of the Treasury select committee. The intended symbolism of the triptych was that averting a hard Brexit is a mission that transcends party boundaries.That message might resonate with some non-aligned voters, but it is hard to imagine a collection of messengers less likely to shift opinion in Corbyn’s camp. The official Labour view is that single market membership is incompatible with the referendum result. That is a facsimile of May’s argument. It is also untrue. The ballot paper had no subsidiary questions on post-EU arrangements. So why is Labour pumping up the tyres on May’s hard Brexit bus?Three reasons stand out. First: a fear of being cast as\u0026nbspEurophile saboteurs. In legal terms, the EEA is not the\u0026nbspEuropean Union, but in cultural terms the accusation\u0026nbspof a sellout resonates with many leave voters. Labour is not polling well enough in areas that voted for Brexit to risk letting off a remain-themed firework in\u0026nbspparliament.Second: squeamishness about immigration policy – EEA membership would preserve free labour movement. That doesn’t have to mean totally unregulated borders: there are mechanisms such as work permits for managing migration from within the single market. But to advertise them, Labour would have to take the initiative on a subject that is fraught with risk. Perceived softness on immigration costs the party votes, while any hardening of rhetoric would jar with Corbyn’s caring brand. By rejecting the single market he can be strict on borders without sounding mean to foreigners.Third: there is ideological hostility to single market rules prohibiting certain forms of industrial subsidy. Those restrictions, it is argued, would obstruct a radical-left economic programme. Whether that is true depends on how radical and how left you want to go. Everything in Corbyn’s 2017 manifesto could have been implemented within existing EU rules. The leader’s office might be fizzing with more drastic anti-capitalist plans, but no one says what they are.The arguments over Labour’s Brexit position are a tangle of dogma, idealism and electoral pragmatism. They don’t map neatly on to the outdated scheme of a Corbynite movement in conflict with a Blairite reaction. There are Momentum activists who burn with the spirit of remain. There are Labour MPs who would bury\u0026nbspCorbynism but also bow to the Eurosceptic will of their constituents.The more fundamental distinction is between those who start from the belief that any Labour government is always better than any alternative, and those who don’t. For tribal loyalists, Brexit strategy is subordinate to the goal of beating the Tories. That is the lens the leadership applies and it would be bizarre if it didn’t. (Whether it makes the right choices to achieve that goal is a different matter.)Then there is the ethos expressed by Miliband, Clegg and Morgan today, that getting Brexit right is in the national interest, bigger than any party. There are Labour backbenchers who have no affection for the current leadership but cannot imagine campaigning in a rosette that isn’t red. But others have crossed that psychological Rubicon. They expect to be driven out of the party before a general election, either by the Corbyn machine or their own consciences. Their allegiance is more remain than Labour. They will vote accordingly.Beyond parliament, tension between pro-European and pro-Labour feelings is strangely submerged. Many of Corbyn’s enthusiastic younger fans are also eager remainers. The leadership strategy seems to be to persuade them that leaving the EU is only a disaster because it is being organised by Tories. Make Jeremy prime minister, the argument goes, and the bad feelings disappear. It is true Corbyn commands phenomenal amounts of trust. But many of his supporters also want to stop Brexit, or at least to vote on it again. And they can see that their leader is less bothered.Corbyn’s eager acceptance of the referendum result could, at first, be lauded as fulfilling his duty as a democrat. The same could just about be said when he voted for article 50 and again when he ran on a pro-Brexit manifesto. When he sacked a shadow cabinet minister who called for another referendum, it was a question of loyalty and discipline … But then, why doesn’t Corbyn want a public vote on the final deal? Why would he whip MPs to abstain in a vote to make Brexit softer? Why take the afternoon off to make a Tory prime minister’s job easier?At some point even the most indulgent audience will see these as the choices of a leader who not only likes Brexit, but likes it hard. Then the question is whether Labour remainers trust Corbyn more than they hate leaving the EU. How far can he test their patience? He seems determined to find out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/059d4c1a5b7c83d8624e57d7eda0db3708e7005b/0_0_4134_4134/master/4134.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc309a6367817151cf906f7e28b7ccbd 1010w","title":"david moyes west ham talks next week","story":"• Former Everton manager’s current deal expired on Sunday• West Ham also looking at other options to replace MoyesWest Ham are aiming to end the uncertainty over their managerial situation in the next fortnight and will give themselves time to pursue other options before deciding whether to offer David Moyes a new contract.An added complication, however, is that Moyes might choose to reject an offer from West Ham. The former Everton manager has expressed doubts of his own in the past fortnight and wants assurances that he will receive enough backing to challenge for a top-eight finish. Final talks are expected between Moyes and David Sullivan, the co-owner, in the middle of next week, giving both parties enough time to think things through properly.Yet while the club’s board want to let the dust settle on their troubled campaign before appointing a manager, they are aware of the risks of leaving the position unoccupied too long given the need to strengthen the first team this summer. There is no guarantee that West Ham will be able to attract one of their favoured picks to the London Stadium and, having acknowledged that Moyes kept them up in difficult circumstances, they could yet ask him to continue as their manager.West Ham are interested in Newcastle’s Rafael Benítez and have held informal talks with Manuel Pellegrini, who has also been heavily linked with Sevilla.

Mitrovic is having a moan at the officials about being bundled over on the edge of the area by Forsyth, who was playing with fire.44 min: Closer and closer. Targett swings in a cross from the left. Mitrovic rises above Forsyth, six yards out, and his powerful header looks destined for the back of the net - only for Carson to make a stunning reflex save! Fulham can’t believe it.43 min: Fredericks runs at Anya, who’s pushed back into the area, and the right-back decides to have a pop. It’s dipping under the bar but Carson leaps back to push it over! Fulham are getting closer.42 min: Jerome goes for goal from 25 yards, but his effort’s dreadful.41 min: Kamara pops up on the left, cutting inside and letting fly from 20 yards. It’s low and swerving, but Carson beats it out. Fulham settle for a corner. But that comes to nothing.38 min: Anya pulls a cross into the area from the left byline. The ball eventually comes to Wisdom on the edge of the area, but the right wing-back blooters his shot over.36 min: Mitrovic receives the ball with his back to goal. A drop of the shoulder shakes off Davies and opens up a sight of goal, only for the striker to bend his 18-yarder inches past the left post. The Fulham fans were getting ready to celebrate. Instead they greet their team’s latest miss with anguished howls.34 min: Mitrovic drags a shot wide from 25 yards. All a bit anxious from Fulham. Derby are taking every opportunity to waste a few seconds when they can.32 min: Johnson screws a shot wide after a decent Derby break. McDonald, meanwhile, is lucky not to be booked for a cynical trip on Weimann.30 min: Sessegnon has had six touches. Admittedly he might have scored with one of them, but Fulham need to work the ball to the 17-year-old more.28 min: Mitrovic glances a header a few yards wide from Fredericks’ cross.25 min: McDonald threads a pass to Mitrovic, who holds off his marker and lays the ball off to Johansen, who arrows a drive just over the angle of post and bar from 18 yards.23 min: Anya saunters down the left, does a stepover to make space for a cross and zips a low ball into the six-yard box. It’s a fine delivery but it’s just behind Jerome, who can’t scramble it in, much to Fulham’s relief. The ball’s hacked away.20 min: Mitrovic plays a one-two with Sessegnon, but he scuffs his shot straight at Carson from 18 yards. Up the other end, Jerome turns and knocks a clever ball through to Weimann. The Austrian’s dangerous cross has to be turned over his own bar by Fredericks.19 min: Derby are proving tough to break down. Fulham are going to require patience.17 min: McDonald looks like he’s going to run to a loose ball on the edge of the area, only for Cairney to take it off his captain. The move fizzles out. Oh dear.15 min: Lawrence’s free-kick is headed away as far as Weimann, who volleys well over from 25 yards.14 min: A Fulham attack breaks down and Lawrence is able to lead Derby away down the left, eventually winning a free-kick when Kamara clips his heels.11 min: Derby loft a deep free-kick into the Fulham area. Keogh beats the offside trap on the left and lofts a high cross into the area. Nothing comes from it in the end, but Derby are showing signs of having the measure of Fulham in the air.8 min: Jerome heads on a long ball and Fredericks puts it behind for Derby’s first corner. Cairney clears it at the near post and Fulham counter after Derby twice give the ball away cheaply on the right. It’s a three-on-one break, led by Kamara, and Derby are all over the place! Kamara sweeps the ball across to Sessegnon, who takes a touch and shoots high towards the right corner, only for Carson to palm the youngster’s effort wide!7 min: Derby attack for the first time and Lawrence whips in a cross from the right. Weimann attacks it but Bettinelli gets there first. Weimann, sliding in, takes the Fulham keeper out with his momentum. It was an accident. After a brief exchange of words, all’s well.I think he’s really benefited from working under a Serbian manager. Jokanovic has been able to connect with him. I doubt Benitez will fully trust him. Mitrovic hasn’t really shown much in the Premier League yet.2 min: Fulham, looking to start quickly, attack after Jerome concedes possession. Johansen feeds Kamara, who can’t do anything with a low centre from the right. Fulham keep pressing, though, and Cairney shoots straight at Carson from 25 yards.Peep! Derby, in fluorescent yellow, get the game underway in the south-west London late-evening sun. Fulham, in white shirts and black shorts, are kicking from left to right.Here come the teams! Craven Cottage, such a lovely ground, is rocking.An email! “Nerviness is right,” David Hopkins says. “I tried to tell myself that Derby squeezing up through the playoffs might not be a good thing after what happened last time they did that, but it hasn’t worked.” While we wait for the team news, here’s Nick Miller’s preview of tonight’s game.Are Fulham going to blow it? They might be about to blow it. They’re regarded by many as the best footballing side in the Championship – don’t shout at me, Wolves fans, that’s what other people are saying – but that might not stop them from blowing it. They’ve already missed out on automatic promotion to Cardiff City, despite going 476 games unbeaten, and are in danger of suffering more play-off woe after freezing in the first leg of their semi-final against Derby County on Friday night.Derby arriving at Craven Cottage clutching a one-goal lead thanks to Cameron Jerome and Gary Rowett’s men will back themselves to get the job done. They can be a stubborn lot when they’re in the mood and will certainly take a repeat of the 1-1 draw they earned at this ground in November. Fulham, however, will back themselves to turn this around. They have the firepower to do so and Derby, remember, finished 13 points behind them in sixth place. You can make arguments for either side: welcome to the nerviness of a play-off semi-final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1651037032e95965f8e7f2923b593a03c9b55007/487_973_5055_3034/master/5055.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c576395fa97d3783ba9cdbb2e10cc6d4","title":"life microcephaly afghanistan in pictures","story":"In an impoverished country where support is limited at best, people with disabilities must look to their families for help.

In the notes she scribbled when covering the Patty Hearst trial in 1976 she unpicks her privilege through memories of fancy meals, mid-flight, “Lunching Aloft on Beltsville Roast Turkey with Dressing and Giblet Sauce,” then, “Stuffed Celery au Roquefort over the Rockies”.Though she dwindled to 75 pounds, cooking seems to be for Didion, now 83, one of the rituals that helped her keep on living when everything (John died at the dinner table as she mixed a salad Quintana died two years later, at 39) had shattered around her. After Dunne’s death there was a period when all she ate was congee in the documentary she cuts the crusts off a cucumber sandwich while she reads from The Year of Magical Thinking, her report from the frontline of grief. Translating it into a play, David Hare took the opportunity to plump her up. He set up a table in the theatre, and a sign: Cafe Didion. Here he’d insist she ate, croissants and jam in the morning, sandwiches at lunch.It seems reductive to tie Didion so tightly to death, but it’s there even in her recipe book. From the parsley salad for 40, the quantities shrink as time passes, to 12, to 8, to the cucumber sandwich, for one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4688e3f54a96fac4e92b9825170791681e713afd/0_0_6015_3608/master/6015.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d11a35bcb2a82f9d5da09d6cd21ae47c","title":"nigel slater salad recipes for early summer","story":"Zesty noodle salad with sprouted beans, and papaya with passion fruit and ginger – luscious and refreshing dishes best eaten outdoorsAs the days warm up, I find myself in need of recipes that involve slightly less time spent at a hot stove. The sort of unhurried cooking that fits comfortably into summer living, when there seems to be less time to cook and when the great outdoors beckons. There is not one of this month’s collection of recipes we haven’t eaten outdoors, mostly at the table but a couple eaten on our laps sitting on the kitchen steps.Use whatever noodles you have around for this crisp, light salad. I have suggested brown rice noodles but only because that is what I had in the house. The dressing is at its most refreshing when sharp, sweet and hot, but tweak it to your liking, adding more palm sugar or lime juice as you wish.For the dressinglimes juice of 2 light soy sauce 2 tsppalm sugar 2 tspsmall hot red or green chilli 1garlic 2 small young clovesRinse the mung beans under icy-cold running water and drain. Scrub the carrot, slice thinly lengthways, then into matchstick-size strips. Pour boiling water over the noodles and leave to soak for 10 minutes till swollen and tender. (Check the cooking instructions on the packet depending on the noodles you are using.)Lightly peel the cucumber, then slice in half from stalk to tip, scrape out the seeds and core with a teaspoon and discard them. Cut the cucumber into pencil-thick slices. Remove the leaves from the coriander, leave any small ones whole, and roughly chop the larger ones. Do the same with the mint leaves. Shred the pak choi.Toss the mung beans, carrot, cucumber, pak choy and herbs together. Drain the noodles and toss with the vegetables and herbs.Make the dressing: mix together the juice of the limes, the light soy and sugar. Finely chop the red chilli and add to the dressing. Peel, smash, then finely chop the garlic. Toss the dressing, vegetables, herbs and noodles together. Finally, coarsely chop the peanuts and scatter over the salad.Classic flavours here – mushrooms with garlic and tarragon, but served as a salad rather than in the traditional manner. You could happily serve this to start a summer lunch, but I like to put them on the table with cold roast beef.Serves 4 as a side saladwhite chestnut mushrooms 200gtarragon 10ggarlic 3 small clovesolive oil 6 tbsplemon juice of 1 largepea shoots 4 loose handfulsyoung salad leaves a couple of handfulsFinely slice the mushrooms, about the thickness of a pound coin, then put them in a shallow mixing bowl. Pull the leaves from the tarragon stems. Finely slice the garlic.Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan over a low to medium heat, add the sliced garlic and fry for three or four minutes till pale gold and deeply fragrant. Keep the heat low to moderate, and remove from the heat as soon as the oil is infused with the garlic. While the oil is still warm, pour over the sliced mushrooms, add the tarragon and toss the garlic, tarragon and mushrooms gently together.Squeeze the lemon juice over the mushrooms, cover with cling-film and set aside in a cool place for 30 minutes to an hour, until the mushrooms are soft and almost translucent. Rinse and dry the pea shoots and leaves, then pile them on a serving dish. Spoon the mushrooms on top and serve.This is my go-to salad. A rearrangement of classic ingredients into a great bowl of food I am happy to eat on any occasion. Even for breakfast. The point is that the ingredients are all those I have in the house anyway. And if there is no pancetta, streaky bacon will do.Serves 2-4For the dressingegg yolks 2olive oil 4 tbspdijon mustard 1 tbsp lemon juice of ½For the saladsmall gem lettuces 2pancetta 50g, thinly slicedanchovy fillets 3chopped parsley 2 heaped tbspfresh white bread 50gbutter 40ggrated parmesan 2 tbspPut the egg yolks into a salad bowl then gradually add the olive oil a few drops at a time, beating constantly with a balloon whisk, then stir in the mustard and lemon juice.Trim the lettuce and separate into inidual leaves. Wash in iced water and dry in a salad spinner.Grill the pancetta or fry in a dry, shallow pan until crisp and drain on kitchen paper. Finely chop the anchovy fillets and mix with the parsley.Make crumbs from the bread, either by hand or in a food processor. Melt the butter in a shallow pan, add the crumbs then let them colour lightly over a moderate heat. Keep them moving so they don’t burn. When they are crisp and golden, stir in the chopped anchovy, parsley and grated parmesan.Put the lettuce leaves into the dressing then add the crisp pancetta and the toasted crumbs, toss gently and serve.Asparagus is never better than when glistening in a fine layer of fat – be it melted butter, Hollandaise sauce or dipped into a lightly boiled egg. I suggest wrapping it in lardo, which softens under the heat basting the spears as it melts. If this gently aromatic product evades you, pancetta cut in very fine slices will work too.Bring a pan of water to the boil. Trim the asparagus. Lightly salt the water then gently lower in the asparagus and leave to cook for about 9 minutes, testing regularly for tenderness. The exact time will depend on the thickness of your asparagus.Heat the oven grill. Slice the baguette in half lengthways, then into four pieces, moisten the surface of each with a little olive oil, then toast under the grill till pale gold in colour.Drain the asparagus, then loosely wrap the spears in clusters of three in a couple of slices of the lardo or pancetta. Place the spears on the toasted bread and return to the grill until the lardo is translucent and sizzling.Trickle over a little more of the olive oil and serve immediately.Papaya – fragrant, soothing and luscious when fully ripe – is something I usually keep for breakfast in summer. Its true flavour shines in the company of lime or sharp orange juice or, best of all, passion fruit. Ginger and mint put a spring in its step too.Serves 4passion fruit 4papaya 2 small or ½ a very large one (about 800g)vanilla pod ½ginger a thumb-sized piece small mint leaves a fewSlice each passion fruit in half then scrape their pulp, juice and seeds into a small, fine sieve or tea strainer suspended over a small bowl. Using a teaspoon, push everything through the sieve until only the dry seeds remain. (I like to reserve a few of the juicer seeds to finish the dish with – I find the contrast of soft fruit and crunchy seeds pleasing.)Peel the papaya, slice in half and discard the seeds. Slice the fruit thinly, each piece about the thickness of a pound coin. Lay them in a shallow layer in a large, shallow dish or deep plate.Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways, scrape out the black paste with the point of the knife, then stir it into the passion fruit juice. Peel the ginger and grate it finely to a soft, wet paste, then stir some of it into the passion fruit juice, tasting as you go. It should be sweet-sharp and slightly spicy. Add more ginger as you wish. I find about 2 teaspoons perfect.Spoon the passion fruit and ginger dressing over the slices of papaya, together with any reserved passion-fruit seeds, cover loosely with clingfilm and chill for a good hour before serving. As you bring the dish to the table, refresh the papaya with any juice that may have pooled around the fruit, and scatter over a few young, fresh mint leaves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e420aaccabfa28a9ca0a5e6c3c8585aa75c9977/0_222_5224_3134/master/5224.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32f9d1c74e3ed1f6a0ef18ac97ba08a0","title":"the gorbals 18 may 1968","story":"Photographer David Newell-Smith travelled to Scotland to document life in the notorious area of Glasgow.The City of Glasgow was once called the Second City of the Empire. It remains superb.Its streets are wide and nobly lined with mansions and offices that would flatter a capital. It has rich museums, universities, theatres and 50 dance halls. It has well-kept parks and a graceful river. This is a great city with a character as strong and pleasing as its national drink.But it is also a city that considers itself in trouble. It believes itself to be in the grip of a crime wave, not so much of robbery as of a degenerate, mindless, pointless violence. This week, for example, a 16-year-old boy, who could not run away because he had an artificial leg, was stabbed three times by young strangers in a park. They ran away, shouting “Shamrock”. A 12-year-old boy, the son of a policeman, waiting at a bus stop, was slashed down his jaw-line with a razor. And again there was no reason for an attack that was as casual as a smile at a pretty girl. A girl looking into a shop window with friends was stabbed in the back, apparently because she had refused to kiss a strange young man.The worst of Glasgow’s recent experiences came over the Easter weekend. Then there were 21 serious assaults and 25 robberies with violence. Nearly 100 people were injured. A boy coming home from church on Good Friday was stabbed by a youthful gang and died on the pavement in his father’s arms. There were 132 brutal attacks in Glasgow in March. There were 56 in the same time a year ago.It is a mysterious business and it is not clear if the situation is worse than in other comparable cities. Violence and its punishment was a major issue in the recent local elections and the Tories first and then the Labour candidates made it one of their chief claims to authority. There are demands for sterner punishments and for more powers of search and arrest for the police, though they would seem to have all that a civilised policeman could require.There were famous fights in the 1920s and 30s when gangs of up to 300 fought each other on the streets. Now Lord Carmont, a judge who handed down punishment like an outraged god, is remembered with longing. He is accorded the honour of having diminished razor slashing. The knife has taken its place and the convenient broken bottle remains.Extract from an article, published in the Observer on 19 May 1968, entitled ‘Where the violence is as casual as the smile of a pretty girl’, by Patrick O’Donovan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e81fcd6b29a327bca255d656114d7e10885984d/0_41_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c146ed8961c4eef1e7d463a7eafe8da9","title":"david miliband nick clegg nicky morgan new brexit supergroup","story":"Morgan, Clegg and Miliband unveil their anti-Brexit initiative. A shame no one was listeningThe remain fightback starts here. In a rice factory in Essex. For one night only, live from the Tilda Pyramid stage, in front of an audience of at least a few dozen, I give you a gala performance of Those We Have Loved. Featuring Nicky Morgan on lead vocals, David Miliband on lead guitar and Nick Clegg on drums. Sometimes you don’t know what you don’t really want until they’ve gone.“Hello Tilda,” Morgan yelled, before segueing seamlessly into her greatest Brexit hits. The leavers were engaged in a collective act of self-delusion and it was time for MPs to put the national interest first and stay in the customs union and the single market. Miliband and Clegg then got to do their brief solos, which more or less echoed what Morgan had already said. Then it was all over. Thank you and good night.Once the four-second ovation had died down, it was time for the encore. Or at least questions. Most of which verged on the existential. Why them? Why now? Why here? Hadn’t all this already been said countless times already? No one really seemed to have a very satisfactory answer. Some things just were what they were.The greatest confusion centred on why Miliband had suddenly decided to drop in on the UK after five years in the US to give us his Brexit thoughts. David appeared nonplussed. His was the highest calling. He was here because he was the Saviour™. And it was his duty to come back every now and again to remind us of what we were missing. That’s what Saviours™ did. They let us know how things could have been if only we had kept the faith. It was his act of kindness to an ungrateful nation.It had been like this: he had been hanging out in New York, jamming with a few dudes, when he’d got the phone call from Nick and Nicky. And he just couldn’t resist the chance of playing a UK gig with such iconic political figures. So he’d dropped everything, taken the red-eye – business class, of course: every Messiah deserved a break – to London, done a quick tour of the Today studios and here he was. Playing to 20,000 bags of rice. You Win a Grain.“Bregsit is a tragedy,” he crooned. He pronounces Brexit in exactly the same way as Tony Blair. It must be a New Labour thing. “But it doesn’t have to be a choice between a hard Bregsit and a chaotic Bregsit.”Did this signal a return to British politics, or was it just a one-off appearance? “It’s not the beginning, middle or end of anything,” Miliband said gnomically. He wasn’t here to start a new cross-party anti-Bregsit group. He was just here. To make a contribution. To serve and to save. He might be back at some point. And there again, he might not be. He was like the wind. A prophet is not without honour except in his own land. David wiped away a tear.It wasn’t long before someone asked about the artistic differences in the 2010 supergroup, the Dave and Ed Mili Band. Were the two brothers still talking after that difficult second album? David suddenly went all coy. What went on between him and Ed had always been private and he was going to keep it that way. Which came as news to everyone who had witnessed their very public bust-up over the leadership of the Labour party.Morgan then fielded a few questions before realising that no one had wanted to ask Clegg anything. The drummer’s lot. She generously chose to allow him to have the last word. “Never underestimate the narcissism of the Brexiters,” he declared.And never underestimate the narcissism of former politicians who fail to realise that the public is no longer that interested in what they have to say. Who just can’t bear to confront the silence of their mortality. David, Nick and Nicky had spoken. But almost no one had listened. Though maybe that had been the point all along. As a metaphor for the futility of Brexit, it couldn’t have been bettered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae7c164f48fd704ebfd81a7a07bf5efe276182c3/0_3_3056_1832/master/3056.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af0ffa67b59a2f72bc78c7b2e7ca88aa","title":"labour shortlists candidates for lewisham east byelection","story":"Four candidates vying to stand for party in next month’s byelection will be put to members’ vote at hustings this weekendA former Ken Livingstone adviser, an anti-Transatlantic trade treaty activist, Lewisham’s deputy mayor and a former mayoral candidate have been shortlisted by Labour to fight to succeed Heidi Alexander in Lewisham East.Labour’s national executive committee has shortlisted Claudia Webbe, Brenda Dacres, Janet Daby and Sakina Sheikh as its four candidates who will be put to a members’ vote at a hustings this weekend.Webbe is the most senior figure in the party of the four candidates, a current member of the NEC and a former adviser to Livingstone at City Hall. The Islington councillor is a vocal supporter of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and was previously the chair of Operation Trident, which tackled the effects of gun crime on black communities.Sheikh, a former member of Students Against TTIP, is a newly elected Labour councillor in Lewisham, the borough where she grew up. Momentum’s national coordinating group will interview both Webbe and Sheikh later on Monday to discuss which candidate to endorse.Councillor Brenda Dacres, who stood unsuccessfully to be Lewisham mayor earlier this year, said she was motivated to stand by the Windrush scandal, as a single mother whose parents were from the Windrush generation. The final candidate is Janet Daby, Lewisham’s deputy mayor, a former social worker who founded a local food project. Labour is near certain to win the seat at the byelection in June. The selection is set to be a fierce battle between Momentum activists, trade unionists and Labour centrists, who control the local party’s executive, though Lewisham Momentum is currently rife with internal isions.A Momentum source said the seat could be “a real tough battle” for the left in the local party. The shortlist means, whatever the outcome, Lewisham East will have an ethnic minority woman as its Labour candidate. Labour has drawn some criticism in recent months for its parliamentary selections in marginal seats, where no ethnic minority women have been selected at all, despite more than 60 selections taking place since the June election. Labour MPs David Lammy and Tulip Siddiq and Operation Black Vote’s Simon Woolley are among those who have called for the party to step up efforts to choose BAME candidates.The speed of the selection process had drawn anger from some local activists in Lewisham East. The constituency party met overnight to draw up their own unofficial shortlist – an attempt to put pressure on the NEC panel to select some of their preferred candidates for the final hustings.The local party chair, Ian McKenzie, who had accused party bosses of a “stitch-up”, told the  both Daby and Dacres had also made the shortlist drawn up by local activists.The Labour leadership and the leftwing grassroots group Momentum are widely reported to prefer Webbe and Sheikh. Leftwing figures in the party are thought to be cautious about selecting Webbe, the former chair of Operation Trident, because she is a member of Labour’s NEC. Were she to resign from the finely balanced committee, her replacement could be a Corbyn-sceptic candidate.PCS equalities representative Phyll Opoku-Gyimah was widely seen as the frontrunner for the seat but unexpectedly dropped out of the race on Sunday, citing personal circumstances. Comments by Opoku-Gyimah comparing the Israel-Palestinian conflict to the Holocaust were unearthed by the Guido Fawkes blog at the weekend.Alexander, the former shadow health secretary who quit Corbyn’s frontbench during the string of resignations over his leadership in 2016, has resigned her seat to take up a role as deputy mayor for transport under the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, at City Hall.

He said there had been a little progress in Brexit talks, but there was a risk of failure linked to the Irish border and the role of the European court of justice in a post-Brexit dispute-resolution system.Nobody should “underestimate the key rendezvous of June”, Barnier said, referring to the EU summit that month, when EU leaders will decide on next steps. “The clock is ticking,” he added.He reiterated warnings that a mooted transition deal would collapse without a Brexit deal in place by October, saying: “The only legal base for the transition is article 50. That means if we want a transition we must have agreement on the withdrawal.”Amid stalemate in Theresa May’s cabinet over future UK-Irish customs arrangements, British companies are being frozen out of contracts that run beyond the UK’s Brexit departure date of March 2019. The European commission argues it would wrong for a non-member state to have access to secure information.Last week a senior boss at Airbus’s Portsmouth arm told MPs that a potential €200m (£176m) contract between the European Space Agency and the company would have to be moved to the continent because of Brexit.The commission says non-EU countries cannot participate in the development of Galileo, although the UK would still be able to use the encrypted signal, pending an agreement.Some observers thinks the tough stance contradicts the potential transition deal in which the UK preserves the status quo, without voting rights, until the end of 2020.Barnier made his comments on Galileo, as he outlined his hopes for a “close partnership” between the EU and the UK to fight terrorism, cyber-attacks and other “hybrid-threats” to Europe’s security. He said the EU would welcome British involvement in EU development programmes and research into military technology. He added that the EU would also look at the UK’s participation in the EU’s overseas civilian and military missions, although he noted that the UK’s contribution had been “marginal so far”.British diplomats have embarked on a diplomatic mission to keep Operation Atalanta in Northwood, while the commission insists that the British operational headquarters and its 56 British staff must go.Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said the UK would be able to take part in EU foreign policy missions in future, as other non-EU states do. “There are some bonds that cannot be broken,” he said, but added that the future relationship would be “radically different” as a result of Brexit. “The centre of gravity moves from being a decision-maker, to being potentially a beneficiary or someone that joins decision that had been taken by others,” Mogherini said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779372983fb1dd65affdacc46f7ea34987eeed4e/0_885_2550_1529/master/2550.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8263b65a9ddcd8184ce2aa764a6d50b","title":"europa moon of jupiter prime candidate for alien life after water blast found","story":"Nasa’s Galileo spacecraft flew through a giant plume of water that erupted from the icy surface of Europa, new analysis showsA Nasa probe that explored Jupiter’s moon Europa flew through a giant plume of water vapour that erupted from the icy surface and reached a hundred miles high, according to a fresh analysis of the spacecraft’s data.The discovery has cemented the view among some scientists that the Jovian moon, one of four first spotted by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610, is the most promising place in the solar system to hunt for alien life.If such geysers are common on Europa, Nasa and European Space Agency (Esa) missions that are already in the pipeline could fly through and look for signs of life in the brine, which comes from a vast subsurface ocean containing twice as much water as all the oceans on Earth.Nasa’s Galileo spacecraft spent eight years in orbit around Jupiter and made its closest pass over Europa, a moon about the size of our own, on 16 December 1997. As the probe dropped beneath an altitude of 250 miles, its sensors twitched with unexpected signals that scientists were unable to explain at the time.Now, in a new study, the researchers describe how they went back to the Galileo data after grainy images beamed home from the Hubble space telescope in 2016 showed what appeared to be plumes of water blasting from Europa’s surface. They found that a sudden blast of water from the Jovian moon explained the Galileo probe’s strange measurements.“There were some anomalous features in that close pass in December 1997 that we never fully understood,” said Margaret Kivelson, a senior scientist on the Galileo mission and emeritus professor of space physics at the University of California in Los Angeles. “We went back and looked at them more carefully and found that they were just what you’d expect if we’d flown through a plume.”On its closest flyby, Galileo swept over Europa at more than 2,230 mph. As it hurtled past, instruments onboard the probe detected a brief but dramatic twist in the magnetic field and a sudden, rapid increase in the density of plasma, or ionised gas, the spacecraft was flying through. Computer simulations created by Xianzhe Jia, a space scientist at the University of Michigan, showed that a 120-mile-high geyser erupting from a relatively warm patch on Europa would create precisely the same readings. Details of the work appear in the journal Nature Astronomy.When plumes of water spray out of Europa, the molecules are immediately battered by highly energetic particles, a process that smashes them into charged ions. It is these ions that produce rapid swings in the magnetic field direction and ramp up the density of plasma above the geyser.“Our detection of a plume based on the Galileo data certainly strengthens the case for future exploration of Europa,” Jia said. One Nasa mission, Europa Clipper, is scheduled to launch in the 2020s with the express aim of finding out whether the Jovian moon could harbour life. Another mission, Esa’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, is expected to launch around the same time and perform flybys of Europa and two other Jovian moons, Ganymede and Callisto.“Given the evidence of plumes available so far, there is a good chance that those spacecraft may obtain direct measurements of plumes ejecting material from the subsurface ocean into space,” said Jia. “Those observations will provide crucial information for us to assess Europa’s potential for life.”As much as scientists may wish it to be otherwise, the Jovian moon is hardly a balmy haven. The surface temperature never rises above -160C (-256F). What warmth there is comes largely from tidal kneading driven by the massive gravitational forces that come with an orbit around Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system. If life has gained what passes for a foothold on Europa, it may be huddled around hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean in a world of frigid, perpetual night.William Sparks, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore and leader of the team that found evidence for water plumes on Europa with Hubble, said it was good to have independent confirmation of the watery blasts.“Europa is a moon of Jupiter that is about the same size as our moon, but it’s got more ocean on it than planet Earth,” Sparks said. “It is completely engulfed by this saline ocean which lies beneath a crust of ice, and in terms of a places to host extant life, I think it’s the best location that we’ve got beyond planet Earth. It would be good to find out what is really there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5324d130219a9234b543f2ed4693e705d1fd3b8f/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c128afaa72acbc2328bb9533d389bf30","title":"industrial trans fats must be removed from food supply who says","story":"UN health agency says trans fats in snack foods, baked foods and fried foods are responsible for 500,000 deaths each yearTrans fats used in snack foods, baked foods and fried foods are responsible for half a million deaths worldwide each year and must be eliminated from the global food supply, the World Health Organization says today.Most of western Europe has already acted to reduce industrially made trans fats from factory-made foods. Denmark, like New York, which followed its lead, has an outright ban. Big food companies elsewhere have been under intense pressure to use substitutes. The WHO is calling on all governments to take action, including passing laws or regulations to rid their food supply of industrial trans fats. Director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said eliminating trans fats would “represent a major victory in the global fight against cardiovascular disease”.The WHO is targeting industrially made trans fats, but trans fats are also contained in milk, butter and cheese derived from ruminants, mainly cows and sheep.Dr Francesco Branca, director of the Department of Nutrition for Health and Development at the WHO, said the amounts we eat in dairy products are unlikely to breach the health guidelines.“We are saying that trans fats contained in those products have the same effect as industrial trans fats – we are not able to tell the difference,” he said. “But the amount contained in dairy products is much less.”Walkers cheese and onion crispsVegetable oils (rapeseed, palm)\u0026nbspRapeseed oil is healthy, but palm oil is a highly saturated fat, widely used in industrially-produced foods because of its very low costWheat flour (with added calcium, iron, niacin, thiamin) Added vitamins but this is finely milled white flourGlucose syrup\u0026nbspAnother form of sugar, made from maize in the USA, where it is called corn syrup, or from potatoes and wheatDextrose\u0026nbspAnother form of sugarVegetable fat (palm) Cheap form of saturated fatMaize starch\u0026nbspOften used as an anti-caking agent in sugarsEmulsifiers (mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids, sorbitan monostearate, polyglycerol esters of fatty acids, soya lecithin, polysorbate 60)\u0026nbspEmulsifiers are additives used to stabilise processed foodsTapioca starch\u0026nbspThickening agent derived from cassava rootsStabiliser (xanthan gum)\u0026nbspMade from fermented sugars.

But attempts to thwart the pathogen by vaccination or antiviral drugs face a number of difficulties – not least because the virus comes in many forms and can mutate rapidly leading to drug resistance.But now scientists say they have discovered a way to nobble the virus that could one day help those with conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis, for whom a cold is not merely a nuisance but a serious health risk.The trick, the authors say, is to develop drugs that interact with one of the enzymes within our cells – an approach that makes it harder for the virus to become drug-resistant.“Viruses hijack the host to make more copies of themselves. This enzyme is one of the host enzymes that the virus hijacks,” said Roberto Solari, visiting professor at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, and a co-author of the study. Writing in the journal Nature Chemistry, a team of researchers based around the UK report how they looked at molecules that interact with a human enzyme that attaches a type of fatty acid molecule on to proteins. While two of these molecules on their own had little effect on the enzyme, the team found that when they were chemically stitched together they became remarkably potent in preventing the enzyme from working as normal.Solari said that is important, since the virus uses the enzyme to assemble the protein coat which surrounds the genetic material of the virus. “What we found is if we block the addition of this fat, the coat doesn’t assemble so the virus doesn’t package its genes into its coat,” he said. “The virus still makes its own genes, it makes the coat, but the coat can’t assemble so the virus can’t replicate – you actually don’t make infectious particles.” The team say the molecule appears to completely prevent the virus from replicating, whether it is added one hour before, one hour after or at the same time as the cells are infected, and that it remains effective up to three hours after infection. The approach was also found to prevent the replication of other viruses in the same family as rhinovirus – including polio and foot-and-mouth disease.But Solari said a cure for the common cold is a long way off: the drug will need to undergo further developments and optimisation before it can be used as a medication, while tests have so far only been carried out on human cells in a dish.“We haven’t done any animal studies, and we obviously haven’t done any studies in humans, so I can’t tell you formally what the animal toxicity of this compound is,” said Solari, adding that it is also unclear whether the approach would work by the time symptoms of a cold appear – typically a few days after infection. “There is a still a long way before this becomes a medicine,” he said.And, even if the latest discovery does eventually lead to a way to treat colds, its use is likely to be limited to those with respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, for whom a catching a cold can be dangerous.“Rhinovirus, the common cold virus, in healthy people is pretty trivial – you have the runny nose, you have a bit of a temperature, you don’t feel well for two or three days, but you get over it,” said Solari.

The procedure sensitised the animals so that when they were prodded in a fleshy spout called a siphon, they contracted their gills in a robust defensive action. Glanzman likens the reaction to being jumpy in the moments after an earthquake: the memory of the event induces an involuntary reflex to any loud noise.After sensitising the sea snails, Glanzman extracted RNA from the animals and injected it into other sea snails to see what happened. He found the recipient sea snails became sensitised, suggesting the “memory” of the electrical shocks had been transplanted. When Glanzman repeated the experiment with RNA from sea snails that had been hooked up to wires but not shocked, the reflex behaviour did not transfer.According to the researchers, the experiments show how essential parts of the memory trace, or engram, that gives rise to sea hare sensitisation are held in RNA, rather than in the connectivity of brain cells as traditional neuroscience dictates.“What we are talking about are very specific kinds of memories, not the sort that says what happened to me on my fifth birthday, or who is the president of the United States,” said Glanzman, whose study appears in the journal eNeuro. The work has not found widespread acceptance. “Obviously further work needs to be carried out to determine whether these changes are robust and what are the underlying mechanisms,” said Prof Seralynne Vann, who studies memory at Cardiff University. “While the Aplysia is a fantastic model for studying basic neuroscience, we must be very careful in drawing comparisons to human memory processes, which are much more complex.”Tomás Ryan, who studies memory at Trinity College Dublin, is firmly unconvinced. “It’s interesting, but I don’t think they’ve transferred a memory,” he said. “This work tells me that maybe the most basic behavioural responses involve some kind of switch in the animal and there is something in the soup that Glanzman extracts that is hitting that switch.”But Ryan added that radical thinking about memory was sorely needed: “In a field like this which is so full of dogma, where we are waiting for people to retire so we can move on, we need as many new ideas as possible. This work takes us down an interesting road, but I have a huge amount of scepticism about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88a389542af3af1243bd3fcae155107b16df7be2/0_204_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64db4b849ddf1f9298135a6b538cdef8","title":"invest sure start tribute tessa jowell government urged labour","story":"Labour calls for increased commitment to early years scheme late MP helped set upMinisters have come under pressure to increase their commitment to Sure Start early years centres as a tribute to their political architect, Tessa Jowell, who died of brain cancer at the weekend.Labour MPs lined up to urge the government to invest in the flagship programme, which was established by the Labour government in 1998 to help give disadvantaged children the best possible start in life. The former shadow education secretary Lucy Powell urged Damian Hinds, the education secretary, to “look again” at the scheme, which has transformed hundreds of thousands of lives across the country.More than 3,000 centres were opened during Labour’s years in power, but hundreds were closed after the coalition government came to power in 2010, a move that Jowell described as heartbreaking. The Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who was Jowell’s parliamentary aide during her time as shadow Olympics minister, told the : “Sure Start was one of Tessa’s greatest achievements. She knew how important family life was to her and how important strong families in particular are to disadvantaged children.“She was desperate when the programme was scaled back to such a great extent across the country. She had hoped there had been a cross-party consensus behind it that would protect it. “In the last few days the number of people who have spoken up to talk about what it means to them is one of the things she would’ve been proudest of, and demonstrates why Sure Start matters so much and ought to be reinstated.”Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, hailed Jowell’s role in setting up the programme. She told MPs: “When I was a young mum, it was the Sure Start centre that really helped me and my son. And for all that’s said and done in this chamber, that is the best that any honourable member can hope to have achieved.”Yvette Cooper described Jowell, a former cabinet minister, as the “mother of Sure Start”. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “The greatest tribute the government could pay to her would be to begin again the proper funding of her most important achievement: Sure Start.”Hinds told MPs he shared the view on “the fundamental importance of the early years” but declined to make any promises, speaking instead about the importance of home life and nursery care, as well as early years centres, in boosting life chances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e101ee2c318fcb6b57ff77209e902ff1e0ba70fb/0_347_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c57e4c9a34fdfb78cb9abdd851b767c","title":"social housing funding system is nuts says top property developer","story":"Roger Madelin calls for higher corporation tax and says reliance on private developers to pay for affordable homes is stupidOne of the country’s top property developers has described the UK’s system of funding social housing as “nuts” and called for higher taxes to speed up building.Roger Madelin, a member of the executive committee at British Land, told the  the decades-old system of getting private developers to pay for affordable homes was “a stupid way of meeting this social need” and that the government should directly fund them.“All companies should pay higher corporation tax,” he said. “This country needs to have more tax paid. If we did it like that we could get on and do it. It can’t work in the long term, you can’t expect developers to continue to produce for the population’s social needs at this level. It should come from general taxation.”Madelin’s suggestion will raise eyebrows in the notoriously profit-driven property industry as it implies increased taxes on its profits. But he is a respected figure who led the regeneration of King’s Cross in London as well as Brindley place in Birmingham and his remarks reflect growing frustration that the system is not only failing to deliver enough cheap housing, it is also a drag on development.He made his proposal as British Land submitted one of the UK’s largest planning applications for a £3bn regeneration of Surrey Quays in east London, with 3,000 homes, up to six skyscrapers and several new corporate headquarters on a site stretching across 53 acres – similar in size to the regeneration of King’s Cross. It is located about a 20 minutes’ tube journey from the City of London, between Shoreditch and Peckham, two rapidly gentrifying areas, on the London overground line. Some 35,000 people already live in the Rotherhithe peninsula, where the development will take place.The total number built, including with state funding, fell from 61,090 in 2011 to 41,530 in 2017.Madelin believes that by avoiding the current haggling between council officers and developers about how much they should contribute to affordable homes, the government could regain control of how much and when much-needed affordable housing could be built.“I find it nonsensical that we go through these viability assessments,” he said. ‘If you have a shortage of cars then you wouldn’t get motor manufacturers to subsidise people who can’t afford a decent car.”The Surrey Quays site is at present occupied by swaths of surface car parking, a 1980s shopping centre and the disused Daily Mail printworks which is currently acting as a 3,000-capacity electronic dance music venue.The planning application features towers rising up to 46 storeys which will have striking views of the Shard, the City and Canary Wharf, all of which are within two miles. Canada Water, an enclosed former dock will be the centre of about 120 acres of open space which will feature walking trails including one, potentially, that winds up and over the exterior of a new entertainment venue. Madelin said he hoped to inspire people to engage in the Italian pastime of “passegiatta” – promenading, a pursuit not normally linked with the Rotherhithe peninsula."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6c0568dcc8ca51cf752b360ed0ba1e54d67ce2e/210_156_3869_2321/master/3869.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b8417d62f2b0e85473216248a591943","title":"england national selector ed smith squad first pakistan test","story":"Ed Smith’s first utterances as national selector are awaited with the anticipation of Greeks hastening to Delphi to listen to the oracle. As for them there is no certainty his outpourings will be understood. This is his first appearance in the role and he will already understand the business of selection is easier as a pundit than an employee of the England and Wales Cricket Board.There has been speculation about what he might do but it is only speculation. The past two national selectors, Geoff Miller and James Whitaker, were always discreet and, to the exasperation of the odd colleague, disinclined to leak. Smith is likely to operate in the same way.on TuesdayOn Tuesday afternoon he announces the squad for the Lord’s Test against Pakistan and there are few certainties beyond the sad news that Jack Leach, who impressed in Christchurch at the beginning of April in his Test debut, will not be at Lord’s.Leach has broken his left thumb. This happened when he was practising his batting, which has improved greatly, before the start of play in Somerset’s match against Hampshire. A ball propelled by the first‑team coach, Jason Kerr, with his dog ball‑thrower, rose steeply and struck the thumb. Leach immediately headed off to the pavilion and by lunch he and his devoted colleagues’ worst fears were confirmed.In the meantime James Vince, a man always under discussion among the selectors, had reached the slowest Championship century of the season and then added another one. Somehow the slower Vince scores the higher his innings is regarded, so this was a timely effort which saved the game for Hampshire and just might have saved his Test place.It was a knock free of frills – he ended up unbeaten on 201 in the longest innings of his career (508 minutes) – that left Somerset’s captain, Tom Abell, scratching his head.Smith, too, must have done a fair bit of head-scratching in the past few weeks. Andrew Strauss spoke of “fresh ideas” on his appointment and it would be remarkable after England’s winter, in which they lost five and drew two of their Tests, if Joe Root led out a side containing all the same men. Yet it is not easy to decide whom to ditch, especially after Vince’s match-saving knock at Taunton allied with the fact he scored 76 in his last Test innings.It is now more likely that Alastair Cook, who surely will survive despite only one score of more than 37 in his 15 Test innings last winter (it was an unbeaten 244 in Melbourne) will have yet another partner. Mark Stoneman has struggled this summer and, even though his most recent Test score (60) is his highest, Smith along with Trevor Bayliss, Angus Fraser and Mick Newell may try a different left-hander. The candidates are Middlesex’s Nick Gubbins, Keaton Jennings of Lancashire and Stoneman’s Surrey partner, Rory Burns.If Vince or Dawid Malan does not survive, then Worcestershire’s Joe Clarke, unlike Lancashire’s Liam Livingstone, has scored timely runs now that the sun has come out. The other possibility is to remove the gloves from Jonny Bairstow and tell him to bat at No 5 (mind you, he could keep wicket from there). This would enable Ben Foakes to be drafted into the side.This is a strategy fast gaining popularity though probably not in the Bairstow household. Unless Smith really is silky‑tongued then he is probably not able to persuade Bairstow of the wisdom of this move. And does he want to alienate one of his best players? It would, however, constitute a “fresh idea”.So would summoning up Jos Buttler, who has hit a rich vein of form, albeit in that abbreviated, old-fashioned form of the game.Selectors are usually more prepared to juggle with their bowling attack, an area where England lack variety when the ball stops moving in the air or off the pitch. With Leach out, Moeen Ali is more likely to be summoned back from India unless they decide to take a punt on one of two raw off-spinners, Surrey’s Amar Virdi or Somerset’s Dom Bess, who toiled without reward in Leach’s absence at Taunton.Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad will be on parade. They must also decide whether to recall Chris Woakes, who seems to function better with a red ball in England than anywhere else. Craig Overton has not been at his best, which means they might seek variety in the pace of Mark Wood or Olly Stone or the slower left‑arm swing of Sam Curran, who may well have impressed the England captain at the Oval over the past few days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f2b5fc1bed0fa7d9f6a450fe5b29381b46b9e5d/0_438_5152_3090/master/5152.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b87c328468055216e94db26202eac541","title":"johanna konta knocks out rybarikova again italian open","story":"Optimism laughs at the scoreboard at all levels of sport, and, in different circumstances, Serena Williams and Johanna Konta took the concept to its outer edges on Monday, two weeks before the French Open.Williams, who is 36 and has played a handful of matches since winning the 2017 Australian Open when seven weeks pregnant, is a contender at Roland Garros, according to her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.“Serena will play the French Open to win it,” he told the WTA’s website of her bid to lift a 24th grand slam title, despite pulling out of Madrid last week then Rome to build on her fitness at his academy in Nice. “Can she do it? Serena can achieve anything. After being her coach for six years, I’m even more sure of that statement.”Konta’s forecast may not be so grand. She has yet to win a grand slam and has not got out of the first round in Paris in three visits, losing last year to Hsieh Su-wei, a doubles specialist ranked 109 in the world at the time. However, she said: “I still maintain I have never not liked clay and I am really enjoying playing on the surface this year.”The evidence is not overwhelming. She lost to the world No 219 Fanny Stollar on the clay of Charleston last month, then the American qualifier Bernarda Pera (97) in Madrid. So the former top-tenner felt entitled to take heart from a tough but welcome victory over Magdalena Rybarikova at the Italian Open – her fourth on the spin in their rivalry.Konta also got the better of the Slovak in Madrid before losing to Pera and, despite hitting 40 unforced errors in two hours and 50 minutes to win 6-4, 6-3, she was smilingly upbeat.Having slipped out of the top 10 to 22 in the world, Konta undergoes further examination of her cheery resolve in the second round, when she plays either lucky loser Aryna Sabalenka or Hsieh.It is not a prospect that bothers her. “I seem to play the same people, so I wouldn’t be surprised if I play her,” she said, laughing.Rybarikova, a semi-finalist at Wimbledon last year, was bumped up in the seedings here when Petra Kvitova, Konta’s scheduled opponent, withdrew at the last minute, exhausted, after winning the Spanish title on Sunday.Four places ahead of Konta in the world rankings, Rybarikova stretched the first set to nearly an hour when Konta might have wrapped it up in half that time had overcooked backhands not let her down in key moments. Nevertheless, she maintained: “I felt good on both sides.”In the peerless setting of Court Pietrangeli, Konta had five chances to break in the first set before crunching out nine points in a row on her opponent’s serve, then slowly found more rhythm in the second set.In all, Rybarikova rescued her serve 11 of 16 times. On Konta’s second match point, a call went against her serve and, replaying the point, she looked relieved to force a closing mistake from her opponent.In Konta’s view, there are way more positives than negatives. “I am moving well on the surface, I am a little clearer on how I want to play and also on how to keep my game as it is, because it is effective on the clay as it is on the grass and the hard. I am doing a better job this season to not really change something that doesn’t need to be changed.”She may prove to be right. There was at least evidence to suggest that, when her groundstrokes are flowing and she hits flat and hard to the corners, not many players can live with her. Her challenge this week and in Paris is to string enough of the good stuff together to go deep in the draw.Then, as she dissected her performance, she sniffled, and said: “I’ve got a bit of a cold but all good. We crack on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a31f307404199cf322bc6251f07fcd0e878ce7e/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32d0bec78b8c602e6069421e55050afb","title":"giro di italia simon yates leading dumoulin froome","story":"Simon Yates launched his first big move when the riders of the Giro d’Italia were toiling up the slopes of Mount Etna. Sitting calmly in the wheels near the front of a large group full of big names, he waited until the finish line was 1.5km away. Then, with a quiet smoothness, he accelerated out of the bunch and simply glided away.Ahead lay only his team-mate Esteban Chaves, who had escaped with 25km to go. As he rode up to the Colombian, Yates knew he had done enough to put himself in the leader’s pink jersey. Crossing the line first would bring a bonus of 10 seconds, against six seconds for second place. With the end of the final stage in Rome still more than a fortnight away, those four seconds may turn out to be crucial.But then Yates did something remarkable. He dropped\u0026nbspback half a bike’s length, watching his team-mate take the stage win. The gesture showed he respected Chaves’s great effort, demonstrated he is\u0026nbspa team player and honoured the history and etiquette of his sport. At 25, he was showing a mature appreciation of the bigger picture.His second great moment came on Sunday, on another mountain. The Gran Sasso d’Italia dominates the Abruzzo region and again Yates found himself approaching the climax of an exhausting 225km stage in the company of the race’s big favourites. As the leading bunch surged towards the finish, Miguel Ángel López, Thibaud Pinot and Domenico Pozzovivo launched inidual attacks but on the last long left-hand bend Yates simply rode around them, sailing clear with the aplomb he had shown three days earlier. By taking the bonus he increased his lead to 32 seconds over Chaves and 38 over Tom Dumoulin, the defending champion, with Chris Froome, who struggled over the line in 23rd place, now more than two minutes in arrears in the overall classification.You could only wonder what certain other British riders were thinking as they watched Yates take his win with a calmness that suggested it was he, rather than Froome, who had several grand tour wins under his belt. Eight years ago, Geraint Thomas, Ben Swift and Peter Kennaugh opted to join the new Team Sky programme, their hearts full of hope and ambition. Each is a talented racer and Thomas even held the yellow jersey for a few days at last year’s Tour de France. But he is 31, while Swift is 30 and Kennaugh 28. Thomas will support Froome at this year’s Tour while Swift is in his second season with UAE Abu Dhabi and Kennaugh his first with Bora-Hansgrohe.Yates, along with his twin brother, Adam, chose a different path. When their time to make a big call came five years ago, they opted to join an Australian team then called Orica-GreenEdge. The team are now known as Mitchelton-Scott and its sporting director, Matt White, has displayed the sort of confidence in the Yates brothers that Sky’s young riders, lining up to support first Bradley Wiggins and then Froome, or sidelined in favour of bigger names from Italy, Spain, Colombia and elsewhere, have never been granted.Born in Bury on 7 August, 1992, nine days after Chris Boardman had laid down a marker for British cycling by winning gold in Barcelona, the Yates brothers followed their father into track cycling and became part of the Olympic development programme in Manchester. When Adam was not invited to take the next step with a place in British Cycling’s academy, he moved to France and spent three years riding for amateur clubs alongside future stars such as Pinot and Warren Barguil. Simon did get an invitation, which he accepted. In 2013, wearing British Cycling’s colours, he won two stages of the Tour de l’Avenir, an important race for promising young riders, and a stage of the Tour of Britain, beating Wiggins and Nairo Quintana to a hilltop finish on Dartmoor.Then came their biggest decision, which for Simon involved rejecting an overture from Sky. It was like a young player from Chelsea’s academy joining Liverpool or Spurs in the belief he would get regular games. Money didn’t come into it, he said he simply appreciated the programme the Australians were offering. It is a sign of the brothers’ shrewdness that, although they are close, they used different agents to negotiate their deals with the same team in case things did not work out for one of them.The past four seasons have been a story of careful development, with one notable blip when the team’s incorrect completion of a therapeutic use exemption form for an asthma inhaler during the 2016 Paris-Nice race brought Simon a four-month UCI ban for “non-intentional doping”. That year Adam won the white jersey for best young rider in the Tour de France, an achievement matched 12 months later by Simon.Now Simon is not just leading a grand tour but doing so with an air of utter confidence. Froome may yet discover his form before the 34km time trial that opens the race’s final week when the powerful Dumoulin represents an equal threat, but further huge mountain stages could give Yates the chance to make up for any time lost.With 2,000km still to cover before the race enters the gates of Rome, it’s a lot to ask. But if you’ve been watching him over the past few days, launching his attacks with lethal timing and a fluency that recalls the sport’s great stylists, you may not want to bet against the Giro celebrating its 101st edition with its first British winner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0dad661e956d68460cd730ae5b97d4fedc6bbcd/0_23_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5edf71e7d1864283e69efc8872e709a6","title":"elon musk tesla reorganization","story":"Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, told employees on Monday the company was undergoing a “thorough reorganization” as it contends with questions over its production schedule and two crashes involving its electric self-driving cars.Musk said in an email that as part of the reorganization the company was “flattening the management structure to improve communication, combining functions where sensible and trimming activities that are not vital to the success of our mission”. Tesla confirmed the veracity of the email, which was disclosed by the Wall Street Journal.On an earnings call earlier this month, Musk said the company was “going to conduct sort of a reorganization restructuring of the company … this month and make sure we’re well set up to achieve that goal”. He added: “The number of sort of third-party contracting companies that we’re using has really gotten out of control, so we’re going to scrub the barnacles on that front. It’s pretty crazy. You’ve got barnacles on barnacles. So there’s going to be a lot of barnacle removal.” Tesla will still hire “to support the Model 3 production ramp and future product development”, Musk wrote in the email. In the latest of two reported crashes that have drawn attention, a Tesla Model S sedan was traveling at 60mph on Friday night when it hit a fire truck stopped at a red light in South Jordan, Utah, about 20 miles south of Salt Lake City, police said on Monday.A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman, Keith Holloway, said “at this point it doesn’t appear that NTSB is investigating”. The Tesla driver suffered a broken ankle and was taken to a hospital while the firefighter was not injured, police said. Witnesses said the Tesla did not brake, police said, adding it was unknown if the autopilot feature was engaged. “Tesla has not yet received any data from the car and thus does not know the facts of what occurred, including whether autopilot was engaged,” the company said in a statement on Monday. The NTSB said last week it was investigating a Tesla accident in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on 8 May that killed two teenagers and injured another.

Like any pet, the starter needs to be constantly fed – in this case, with flour and water. But the spongy blend of wild yeast and bacteria has far outlived any ordinary pet: at 120 years, the sourdough is much older than Christensen, who is 84. Earlier this month, Christensen baked for a new guest: Karl De Smedt, a Belgian baker, who scours the globe for new sourdough strains to add to his “library” in Belgium. So far, the collection in the town of St Vith contains 84 samples in refrigerated glass jars from 20 countries, including Mexico, Greece and Japan. De Smedt’s archive is meant to both showcase geographically erse varieties of yeast and preserve a growing collection for future generations to study.“The taste of Ione’s waffles was amazing. I am from Belgium and she was making Belgian waffles,” said De Smedt. “They were very light, but at the same time, I had a couple of them and they filled my stomach for hours.”In baking, a starter is a culture of yeast and bacteria that converts starch molecules into sugars. During this process, the yeast also produces carbon dioxide, which in turn helps the bread rise. It is a critical – if under-appreciated – component of baking, said De Smedt. “For 5,000 years, everybody on earth who wanted to make bread had to use sourdough,” he said. In modern baking, yeast is extracted, meaning bakers don’t need to feed their starter every few hours: “They were slaves to their sourdough,” he says.De Smedt will bring a sample of Christensen’s starter – labeled “106” – back to the library and also provide some to Italian researchers, in order for them to sequence and study the DNA profile of the sourdough.His visit to Christensen’s home in Whitehorse is part of a journey from Seattle to Alaska and the Yukon, where he is tracing a culinary legacy inadvertently established by gold prospectors.Christensen knows the starter travelled with her great-grandfather around 1897, but she is unsure of its exact origins. Small lumps of yeast and bacteria, often found tucked in the flour sacks of prospectors, were critical during the Klondike Gold Rush. Because most food froze, flour – and the starter – became so important to prospectors that over time, a person from the Yukon became known as a “sourdough”. Dating strains is difficult, says De Smedt, but Christensen’s is among the oldest in his collection. Christensen laughs at the prospect that the starter, with its newfound fame, might eclipse her own impressive list of accomplishments – including first female mayor of Whitehorse, Commissioner of Yukon and Canadian senator. “I’m not looking for legacy. The Yukon is a small community. When there’s something to be done – there were no men’s jobs or ladies jobs – there were just jobs. And if you were there and it needed to be done, you did it.”Before she bakes, Christensen is careful to set aside a small amount of the mixture, in order to feed it back to the starter in the jar. Without doing so, the legacy of the sourdough would come to an end.That the starter will find a new home among other sourdoughs – and in history – is a pleasure in itself for Christensen.“I’m quite proud, because I feel I’m sort of a keeper of a Yukon legend,” says Chirstensen. “I don’t feel it’s just my sourdough. It’s the Yukon’s sourdough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d8fe946c664cac2bb318dac3372c5627923006/0_91_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3a864ce6a9cbc7f6aeae2fef8d2ab02","title":"iraq elections who is moqtadr al sadr","story":"Shia preacher who opposed US-led invasion and led uprisings against troops has taken a surprise lead in Iraq’s parliamentary electionsThe influence of Moqtada al-Sadr, the 44-year-old Shia cleric whose Sairoon coalition has emerged as a leading player on Iraq’s political scene, is as much about his family name as his personality, theological learning or political acumen.Sadr first came to prominence as a preacher in the weeks after the US invasion of Iraq, in 2003, opposing the US-led occupation. His militant followers, including the Mahdi army, were responsible for attacks on US and British soldiers, fuelled violent sectarianism against Iraq’s Sunni Muslims, and dabbled in protection rackets and kidnapping.To enable this, his movement effectively exploited the network set up by his father, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr, who was assassinated in 1999 during the period of Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship.In person, his rivals have confided to journalists, Moqtada al-Sadr is not regarded as particularly impressive, with the epithet “firebrand” acting as a cover for instability and the shortcomings in his clerical education.Increasingly, however, it is Sadr’s relationship with Tehran that has come to define his political identity. While his Mahdi army was once regarded as being heavily reliant on Iranian-supplied expertise, Sadr has now positioned himself as an opponent of Iranian influence – at least when his rivals such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani are involved.Like his father, who saw Sistani as an “Iranian” interloper, Sadr is an Iraqi Arab nationalist. The family has long seen themselves as representing a rival Iraqi seat of Shia learning and influence to Tehran. This has recently seen Sadr reach out to Saudi Arabia, reportedly to give reassurance that Iraq will not simply be another client of Iran.The latest reinvention of his image is as populist as ever. In 2015, he formed an alliance with the Iraqi Communist party and secular groups under an umbrella of security and corruption concerns, two issues that have long dogged day-to-day Iraqi life, and his constituency.Several parties, including those following Sadr’s leadership, have committed themselves to a vision of a non-sectarian and technocratic government. But the history of Iraq’s past decade and a half – and Sadr’s disruptive role in it – suggests that only time will tell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe1c0e4e173f2ac7e3428b93d99e5ce2dcded5a/43_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4787b184c02ea8bacc20e987b0205e4e","title":"is your boss secretly or not so secretly watching you","story":"From microchip implants to wristband trackers and sensors that can detect fatigue and depression, new technology is enabling employers to watch staff in more and more intrusive ways. How worried should we be?Last year an American company microchipped dozens of its workers. In a “chip party” that made headlines around the world, employees lined up to have a device the size of a grain of rice implanted under the skin between their thumb and forefinger. At first, Todd Westby, the CEO of Three Square Market, thought only about five or six people – him and a couple of directors, some of the people who worked in the IT department – would volunteer. But of the 90 people who work at the headquarters, 72 are now chipped Westby has a chip in each hand. They can be used to open security doors, log on to computers and make payments at the company’s vending machines.Can he see it taking off at lots of other companies? “Not necessarily,” he says. Or at least not yet. It’s partly a generational thing, he believes. “You may never want to be chipped but if you’re a millennial, you have no problems. They think it’s cool.” There are other uses for it – two months ago, the company (whose core business is selling vending machines and kiosks) started chipping people with dementia in Puerto Rico. If someone wanders off and gets lost, police can scan the chip “and they will know all their medical information, what drugs they can and can’t have, they’ll know their identity.” So far, Three Square Market has chipped 100 people, but plans to do 10,000.The company has just launched a mobile phone app that pairs the chip with the phone’s GPS, enabling the implantee’s location to be tracked. Last week, it started using it with people released from prison on probation, as a replacement for ankle tags, which Westby describes as “intimidating and degrading”. Could he ever see the company using GPS to track its chipped employees? “No,” he says. “There’s no reason to.”Not all firms would agree. Tech companies are coming up with ever more bizarre and intrusive ways to monitor workforces. Last week the Times reported that some Chinese companies are using sensors in helmets and hats to scan workers’ brainwaves and detect fatigue, stress and even emotions such as anger. It added that one electrical company uses brainwave scans to decide how many breaks workers get, and for how long. The technology is used on high-speed train drivers to “detect fatigue and attention loss”. While this sort of technology may have legitimate safety applications – a similar project was carried out with Crossrail workers using wristbands that sensed fatigue – it’s not hard to see how it could creep into other areas.In February, it was reported that Amazon had been granted patents for a wristband that not only tracked workers’ locations in the warehouse as they “picked” items to be dispatched, but could “read” their hand movements, buzzing or emitting a pulse to alert them when they were reaching for the wrong item. In the filing, Amazon describes it as being able to “monitor performance of the placing of the incoming inventory item into the identified storage location by the inventory system worker”.There are tech companies selling products that can take regular screenshots of employees’ work, monitor keystrokes and web usage, and even photograph them at their desks using their computers’ webcams. Working from home offers no protection, as all this can be done remotely. Software can monitor social media usage, analyse language or be installed on employees’ phones to monitor encrypted apps such as WhatsApp. Employees can be fitted with badges that not only track their location, but also monitor their tone of voice, how often they speak in meetings and who they speak to and for how long.Employees have always been watched at work, and technology has always been used to do it. But where it was once a factory foreman with a stopwatch, or workers having to physically clock in and out, now “all of that physical stuff has gone into digital technology”, says André Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School. “It captures things that you weren’t able to capture in the past, like how many keystrokes are people taking, what are they looking at on their screen while they’re at work, what kind of language are they using. And surveillance follows you outside the workplace now.”How much of this is legal? In the UK, employers are allowed to monitor which websites you look at while at work, says Philip Landau, a partner at Landau Law Solicitors who specialises in employment law. “However, the device they monitor must be partly or wholly provided by work. Employers must also give prior warning if they are going to monitor your online activity, and should make you aware of the relevant social media policy.” It is also legal to monitor keystrokes, though again employees must be told they will be watched. “In companies where this system is in place, it is not uncommon for employers to speak to employees if they feel that their number of keystrokes is low,” says Landau. “It is worth noting that a high number of keystrokes does not necessarily mean high levels of productivity and vice versa.”Employers could theoretically use your computer’s webcam to see when you’re at your desk but “there should be a justification for such monitoring, and you should be informed of it beforehand. You should also be informed what the pictures will be used for, and how they will be stored.” As for GPS tracking, “a company may track any vehicles that they supply to their staff. However, the data they collect must only be used for the management purposes of the company. Any GPS device is not allowed to be turned on if the employee is using the vehicle for personal reasons outside of work.”Amazon says its scanning devices “are common across the warehouse and logistics sector as well as in supermarkets, department stores and other businesses, and are designed to assist our people in performing their roles”, while the company “ensures all of its associates have easy access to toilet facilities, which are just a short walk from where they are working”. It adds: “Associates are allowed to use the toilet whenever needed. We do not monitor toilet breaks.”Some of Bloodworth’s colleagues, he says, were angry about the level of monitoring – “but it was more cynicism and resignation. Most of the people I met hadn’t been in the job very long or were looking for other jobs. Every job was temporary and it was a workforce completely in flux.” Has Bloodworth seen the future? Will we all be monitored like this by our bosses in years to come? Possibly, he says. “One of the things that has arisen in response to the book is that people say work is going to be automated anyway, or workers need to be more flexible, as if this is the way of the future and it’s inevitable, which I think is quite dangerous. Amazon can get away with this because of political choices and because the trade union movement is quite weak. I think other businesses will look at Amazon, see they have had success with this business model – and seek to replicate it.”For his book Working the Phones, Jamie Woodcock, a sociologist of work at the Oxford Internet Institute, spent six months working in a call centre. You get a sense of the monitoring, he says, “from the moment you walk in. You have TV screens that have everyone’s relative performance to each other displayed. Managers collect data on almost every single part of what you do. Every single phone call I ever made was digitally recorded and stored. In terms of monitoring, it’s like being able to call back every single thing somebody has made on an assembly line and retrospectively judge it for quality. We all make mistakes and we all have bad days, but this kind of monitoring can be made retrospectively to sack people and is used to give people a sense that they could lose their jobs at any moment.”Monitoring is built into many of the jobs that form the so-called “gig economy”. It’s not easy to object to the constant surveillance when you’re desperate for work. What has surprised Spicer is how willingly people in better-paid jobs have taken to it. “Prisoners in the past were forced to wear tracking bands but now we willingly put on step trackers or other kinds of tracking devices given to us by our employers, and in some cases we pay for the privilege.” Companies such as IBM, BP, Bank of America, Target and Barclays have offered their employees Fitbit activity trackers.It is part, Spicer says, of “this whole idea of wanting to improve or optimise yourself. A lot of technology is designed to not just feed back data about your performance to your boss, but also give it to you. I guess they’re also seen as cool or fashionable, so it’s not surprising they’re taken up so readily.”Spicer has watched the shift away from “monitoring something like emails to monitoring people’s bodies – the rise of bio-tracking basically. The monitoring of your vital signs, emotions, moods.” Of Three Square Market’s practice of chipping employees, he says: “You can imagine that slowly extending. You could imagine things like employers asking to have your DNA in the future, and other kinds of data.”Surveillance can have positive applications. It’s necessary (and legally required) in the financial industry to prevent insider trading. It could be used to prevent harassment and bullying, and to root out bias and discrimination. One interesting study last year monitored emails and productivity, and used sensors to track behaviour and interaction with management, and found that men and women behaved almost identically at work. The findings challenged the belief that the reason women are not promoted to senior levels is that they are less proactive or have fewer interactions with leaders, and simply need to “lean in”.Still, says, Woodcock, “we need to have a conversation in society about whether work should be somewhere that you’re surveilled”. That need is perhaps most urgent where low-paid, insecure jobs are concerned. “If you work in the gig economy, you have a smartphone,” Woodcock points out, and that smartphone can be used to track you. “I think because many of these workplaces don’t have traditional forms of organisation or trade unions, management are able to introduce these things with relatively little collective resistance.”The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is well aware of the issues of monitoring and data collection. James Farrar is the chair of its United Private Hire Drivers branch, and the Uber driver who won a legal battle against the company last year for drivers’ rights. “They do collect an awful lot of information,” he says. “One of the things they will report to you on a daily basis is how good your acceleration and braking has been. You get a rating. The question is: why are they collecting that information?” Uber also monitors “unusual movements” of the phone when someone is driving (implying it knows if someone is using their phone while at the wheel) and, of course, tracks cars and drivers by GPS.Not all surveillance is bad, says Farrar. In some ways, he would like more. He was assaulted by a passenger and is calling for CCTV in all vehicles, partly for the safety of drivers. “There is a role for surveillance technology,” he says. Ironically, when Farrar went for a meeting with Uber to discuss the assault, the company made him turn his phone off to prove he wasn’t recording it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c01bfce7e255c262bfc2e6ddbf75a7be74ec3d8a/101_0_4797_2880/master/4797.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1379a60cf24e1a08cc95b3461cafee51","title":"south korean companies poised to invest in the north if sanctions relax","story":"Hyundai has set up a working group to explore how it can invest in North Korea should the country start opening upSouth Korean companies are exploring ways to invest in North Korea should the country relinquish is nuclear weapons, as Washington signals US firms may also fund projects in the future.Washington’s top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, said on Sunday private companies may be allowed to invest in North Korea’s power grid and agricultural sectors if the country abandons its nuclear weapons program. But he specified the US government would not be pouring money into the North.While questions remain over whether US firms would want to pour money into North Korea given the many uncertainties, South Korean companies are far more eager to begin investment should sanctions be relaxed.Hyundai Group, a South Korean conglomerate, has set up a working group to explore how it can invest in the North while there have been numerous requests to the South Korean government about restarting the Kaesong industrial complex, according to local media reports. Kaesong was opened in 2004 and over 50,000 North Korea workers filled the site making goods for South Korean firms. The site lies just across the border in North Korea but was closed in 2016 after a nuclear test and rocket launch.Hyundai is also exploring restarting a tourist site at Mount Kumgang, which has been closed to foreigners since 2008 after a South Korean visitor was shot and killed by a North Korean soldier.“We are currently very discreet as nothing is certain, such as whether local or foreign businesses can open businesses there,” an unnamed Hyundai official told the Yonhap news agency. Efforts are being lead by the group’s chairwoman Hyun Jeong-Eun.Previous estimates by the South Korean government have stated it could cost as much as $500bn (£370bn) to rebuild the North’s moribund economy.South Korea and China would need to help Pyongyang establish policy and commercial banks, the South’s financial regulator said in a report on Monday. Outside help would be required to shore up confidence and minimise risk, it said.During last month’s historic Inter-Korean summit, South Korean president Moon Jae-in reportedly handed Kim a USB flash drive containing economic development plans. It included charts and videos detailing rail infrastructure and power plants that could be built if Pyongyang denuclearises. When Moon mentioned to Kim he hoped to travel to a famous mountain in North Korea, Kim made a rare admission about the dismal state of the country’s transport network. He said he would be embarrassed for Moon to make the journey, adding “our transportation, honestly, would be uncomfortable”. In the next breath he praised South Korea’s high speed rail network.

Photograph:  Lynne CameronPA WireHealth care staff in Northern Ireland are concerned about the ability to retain and hire EU colleagues post-Brexit, according to a survey published Monday.Nurses and doctors who live across the Border but currently work in the region are “anxious” and want reassurance, the findings of a workforce engagement exercise found.The feedback was among the key findings of an initiative undertaken to help inform a new strategy for health care staff in Northern Ireland.The plan to modernise workplace policies and procedures is designed to accompany the ongoing programme of reform of health service delivery in Northern Ireland.The Workforce Strategy 2026: Delivering for Our People, which was launched on Monday, has a stated ambition to address challenges with supply, recruitment and retention of staff.In regard to Brexit, one of the strategy’s objectives is: “Take account of and plan for the workforce implications arising from the UK’s exit from the EU and the subsequent implications for the EUEEA (European Economic Area) and non-EUEEA workforce.“The Department of Health strategy’s launch came as it was confirmed how £15 million of a £100 million pot already allocated for health service transformation in 201819 will be spent.Around £5 million will be directed towards the nursing, midwifery and Allied Health Professional workforce.This will include funding for 74 additional pre-registration nursing places, and 25 additional midwifery places, meaning a total of 1,000 nursing and midwifery training places are being commissioned from universities in 201819 — a total the department said represents an all-time high in Northern Ireland.More than 122,000 people work in health and social care in Northern Ireland, including the public, private and voluntary sectors. Around £2.3 billion a year is spent employing those who work in the public sector.Key targets outlined in the 2026 strategy include:- Explore and establish non-salary incentive programmes as a means of recruiting andor retaining people andor dealing with pressures in less popular specialties and locations.- Set up and roll out a regional health and social care careers service targeted at the existing workforce, young people from the age of 14, and possible returners to service.- Develop and integrate new ways of working and jobs across health and social care, and fund sustainable training and development programmes that meet service needs.Northern Ireland department of health permanent secretary Richard Pengelly said: “This strategy recognises that we need to meet the challenge of making the Northern Ireland health and social care sector an employer of choice, by ensuring that the service is fully staffed, well-trained, and that workers can balance their work around the other commitments in their lives.” - PA"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Advertisement calls for nation to \u0026lsquoput an empty space to better use\u0026rsquoInishowen Gateway reportedly inundated with calls about party but declines to explain cancellationClassrooms out of use as garda\u0026iacute and insurance workers carry out inspectionsFormer Garda press chief says he and Martin Callinan decided which reporters to contactDubliner (37) has pleaded not guilty to the murder of David Douglas in July 2016Ex-bank chief denies \u0026lsquodishonestly\u0026rsquo creating impression deposits were \u0026euro7.2bn higherSeven-year-old victim\u0026rsquos father was one of 16 parachutists who had just jumped from aircraftVaradkar had suggested money for pay rises could be used to tackle lower pay for newer entrantsMaterial found on John Whelan\u0026rsquos laptop while garda\u0026iacute investigated harrassment chargesNeurosurgeon building Blanchardstown complex for family killed in arson attackGP says referendum campaign has led to \u0026lsquofundamental isions\u0026rsquo within professionPeter Downey initiated proceedings over refusal to award him degree of barrister at lawVictim thought man was her \u0026lsquosaviour\u0026rsquo as he improved lives of family members so muchPhD student Lifeng Han excluded from college after inquiry into \u0026lsquoinappropriate behaviour\u0026rsquoCourt hears concerns over threats to woman and interference with garda investigationMan argues there was no requirement for him to visit garda station after prison releaseLeo Varadkar calls commission of inquiry \u0026lsquoonly way\u0026rsquo to hold people accountablePint of Science festival will host talks in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and GalwayJunior and Leaving Cert pupils from St Louis will sit exams at Dundalk Institute of TechnologySupt Dave Taylor texted Martin Callinan after resignation to say he was inspirational"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495045.1526320212!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plans for one of ireland s biggest mosques get green light","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWarrenstown mosque: an architect’s view of the complex that An Bord Pleanála has approved for BlanchardstownPlans for one of the largest mosques in Ireland have been given the go-ahead by An Bord Pleanála in spite of local opposition.The planning-appeals board has said the Shuhada Foundation of Ireland can build a four-storey mosque, community centre and primary school on the site of Warrenstown House, a former HSE facility in Blanchardstown, in west Dublin.Dr Taufiq al-Sattar, a Dublin-based neurosurgeon, pledged to build the mosque in memory of his late wife, Shehnila Taufiq, who died along with their daughter Zainab (19) and sons Bilal (17) and Jamal (15) in an arson attack in Leicester, England, in September 2013. Its tapering steel minaret, from where Muslims are called to prayer, will be 29m (95ft) high, the equivalent of seven or eight storeys.The board approved the development after finding that it would not seriously harm local amenities or property or cause a traffic hazard.Fingal County Council approved the plan last year, but it was then appealed by Patrick Regan, a former local resident, on the grounds of noise pollution, traffic congestion and lack of public consultation. A number of other locals lodged observations and a petition they expressed concerns about the visual and aural impacts of minarets excessive scale, overdevelopment and unsustainable development lack of integration with the local community and creation of an exclusive community.The council told the appeals board that the minaret will not be visually obtrusive and that any potential noise disturbance will be controlled by planning conditions. It also said the Shuhada Foundation of Ireland has indicated that the school and community centre will be open to everyone.Plans for the development were first lodged in 2016. They were substantially revised and scaled down last year after the council raised concerns about the scale of the development.“The call to pray can often start as early as 5.30am and the last call to pray at 9pm, causing noise pollution, with up to 150 worshipers attending at any one time during normal day prayers, without the celebration of Ramadan and other social events.”The new mosque will be financed from Dr al-Sattar’s family fund, his life savings and donations from the Muslim community in Leicester.

Photograph: Ronen ZvulunReutersIreland should join the US and move its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, Israeli government has said. American officials are in Jerusalem for Monday’s relocation of the embassy from Tel Aviv to the contested city, a move the Israeli government has embraced but the Palestinians have condemned.Israeli government spokeswoman Michal Maayan said: “We’re inviting Ireland to join because the issue of Jerusalem, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, it’s going to be the capital of Israel whatever future settlement we will arrive with Palestinians.“Hence it’s not really a conflict, not for us, not for future agreements and I think we can see also the reaction amongst the Arab world, the rest of the world,” she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Monday. Ireland’s embassy to Israel is located in the town of Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv. “Everyone thought the sky was going to fall when this resolution passed, when the announcement passed, when we can see that it’s all so natural for the US and other countries. “So we call on Ireland to join this and to move its embassy. And obviously Jerusalem is going to be a complex issue that will be resolved once the Palestinians return to the table to negotiations, this is going to be one of the issues.“But moving embassies to Jerusalem isn’t stopping peace, it’s actually helping peace because it’s helping the Palestinians realise that Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish state of Israel and it helps them realise a reality that’s very important to us to go further on.”Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Ireland would not be moving its embassy to Jerusalem “unless and until there is a comprehensive agreement on a broader peace process”.He told RTÉ’s News at One that he thought it was “unwise” for the US to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel at this time.“It is also unwise to move the US embassy to Jerusalem”, he said, because it was “inflaming an already very tense situation and relationship between Palestinians and Israelis”.Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognised internationally.The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. They view the relocation of the US embassy as a one-sided move that invalidates America’s role as an impartial peace broker in the region. -the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

Such a religious bigot should not be giving the prayer that opens the United States Embassy in Jerusalem.”The message was liked by more than 30,000 other Twitter users. In an apparent response to the criticism, Mr Jeffress tweeted:  “Historic Christianity has taught for 2,000 years that salvation is through faith in Christ alone.“The fact that I, along with tens of millions of evangelical Christians around the world, continue to espouse that belief, is neither bigoted nor newsworthy.”Mr Jeffress is the pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, a Southern Baptist megachurch in Texas, and is a member of Mr Trump’s Evangelical Advisory Board. He is said to have made more than 2,000 media appearances - regularly on the right-leaning Fox News cable channel - and has written 23 books. Mr Jeffress said in his 2008 ‘Politically Incorrect’ series:  “God sends good people to Hell. Not only do religions like Mormonism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism—not only do they lead people away from the true God, they lead people to an eternity of separation from God in Hell.“You know Jesus was very clear: Hell is not only going to be populated by murderers, and drug dealers, and child abusers Hell is going to be filled with good religious people who have rejected the truth of Christ.” Mr Romney has re-entered frontline politics by running to become the senator for Utah. US First Lady Melania Trump has kidney surgery for \u0026#39benign\u0026#39 conditionMeghan Markle: The story of the American actress about to join the Royal familyRoyal wedding guest list: Who has been invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVWhat time does the royal wedding church service start?

He said this was a worrying development as health care workers are known as amplification factors for such outbreaks.The WHO said that $18 million (£13.25m) is needed for a three-month operation to fight the disease.

However, Dr Salama stressed that this is an experimental vaccine.This is not a licensed product and there are a lot of complications with using an experimental vaccine which requires to be kept in the long term at between minus 60 and minus 80 degrees celsius. So this is not a simple logistical effort, he said.WHO is desperate to avoid a repeat of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which killed more than 11,000 people.The agency, which was accused of being slow to respond in 2014, is working with the Congolese ministry of health to gather and test samples, conduct contact tracing and improve data collection and management. They are conducting a retrospective analysis of the chain of transmission to better understand the outbreak.Are we prepared for the next Ebola-scale epidemic?The outbreak occurred in Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumba, a remote part of the country, two to three days travel from the capital.The World Food Programme has put in place an air-bridge between Kinshasa, Mbandaka, the provincial capital and affected areas, with flights six days a week to deliver supplies and personnel.WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited the affected area, Bikoro in the north west of the country, at the weekend and praised the Congolese government\u0027s efforts.Ebola is one of the world\u0027s most notorious diseases, being both highly infectious and extremely lethal.It is caused by a virus that has a natural reservoir in the bat, which does not itself fall ill, but can pass the microbe on to humans who hunt it for bushmeat.The virus is handed on through contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. After an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat.That is often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.It is DRC\u0027s ninth known outbreak of the disease since 1976, when it was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security \u0026#39Magical\u0026#39 collection of poems about mental illness and the beauty of the rainforest scoops £10,000 Ondaatje PrizeUS First Lady Melania Trump has kidney surgery for \u0026#39benign\u0026#39 conditionMeghan Markle: The story of the American actress about to join the Royal familyRoyal wedding guest list: Who has been invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVWhat time does the royal wedding church service start?

The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd.

The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonIt is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.Wedding at Windsor CastleThe couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, will walk Ms Markle down the aisle, but may not make a formal speech.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridThe royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleUS First Lady Melania Trump has kidney surgery for \u0026#39benign\u0026#39 conditionMeghan Markle: The story of the American actress about to join the Royal familyRoyal wedding guest list: Who has been invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVWhat time does the royal wedding church service start?

Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.Wedding at Windsor CastleThere, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeMeghan\u0027s father will meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door, before walking her down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the grounds of Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39Magical\u0026#39 collection of poems about mental illness and the beauty of the rainforest scoops £10,000 Ondaatje PrizeUS First Lady Melania Trump has kidney surgery for \u0026#39benign\u0026#39 conditionMeghan Markle: The story of the American actress about to join the Royal familyRoyal wedding guest list: Who has been invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding 2018: Full details and latest newsModern marriage is no longer patriarchal - because of mixed hen parties, lawyer argues Mitt Romney calls pastor speaking at Jerusalem embassy opening a ‘bigot’Who is Moqtada al-Sadr, the radical cleric who looks set to take power in Iraq?Sergei Skripal \u0026#39was briefing intelligence officers in Eastern Europe\u0026#39Thomas Markle \u0026#39will not fly to Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s wedding after suffering heart attack\u0026#39Meghan Markle to spend the last night of her single life at Profumo Affair hotelFather of one of two British medics kidnapped in Congo speaks of relief as they head homeMan in hospital after shark attack off the Cornish coast At least 55 Palestinians killed by Israeli troops in Gaza protests as US opens Jerusalem embassyComment: David Miliband says Brexit will lead to ‘great tragedy’.

The new handset – which packed new internals into the small body of the iPhone 5 – proved immediately popular, and Apple is said to have been surprised by the scale of the interest in the new phone.Now Apple is rumoured to be updating the two-year-old handset. The sheer quantity of the rumours does appear to suggest that something is on the way – though it\u0027s not clear what exactly that might be.Apple finds technique that could revolutionise how iPhones are madeThe company might simply choose to upgrade the internals so that they are faster and more fresh, without making any major changes to the outside. That was suggested by usually reliable analyst Ming-chi Kuo, who said earlier this year that his sources in the supply chain didn\u0027t appear to be expecting a drastic overhaul that would bring new features like wireless charging or the iPhone 8\u0027s glass back.However, some rumours suggest a far more extreme change. Leaks that claim to have come from the Chinese supply chain have suggested that the company could be preparing an update to the iPhone SE that would make it more like an iPhone X – including that phone\u0027s edge-to-edge display and the trademark notch that cuts into it – though those rumours are far from confirmed.Many of the rumours suggest that the new phone could come sooner rather than later, and that it will launch long before the main updates to the iPhone arrive in September.If the phone does receive a significant upgrade, it is unlikely that the company would reveal it without an event at the same time. There will probably be only one event before the major iPhone reveal in the Autumn – Apple\u0027s Worldwide Developers Conference, where it tends not to reveal new hardware.But if only the insides receive an upgrade to make them faster, then it is possible Apple could release the new phone with a simple press release.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Linda* emptied her refrigerator, packed some clothes, her toothbrush, toothpaste and an iron, and left the house she had lived in for 34 years – for good.“I closed the door, turned my back, started my car and left,” she says. “I had lived there since February 1977. A lot of things, carrying a lot of memories, remained behind that closed door.” The hardest room to leave was her personal library. “It is funny that one can miss the books as much as I do, it’s as if they were part of my blood.”In October 2017, I meet Linda, a regal-looking woman with glasses and silver hair. We sit in the lobby of a hotel in downtown Helsinki, a few blocks from the apartment she lives in today. When she first moved, she bought a bed, a TV and a broken sofa from the previous tenant. She didn’t bother to get any chairs – she didn’t think she’d be there long. It’s been more than six years. The problems with her old house started in 2008, when she began to get fevers and developed issues with her voice. A building company found high levels of mould in her basement. She says that, although she tried to get her house cleaned, the mould seeped its way into all her belongings. She began to feel so ill that she had no choice but to abandon her home. After leaving, her symptoms persisted and her health continued to deteriorate. She tells me she became highly sensitive to other buildings, minuscule levels of mould, and chemicals or smells. When she went to the doctor, she was told these multiple chemical sensitivities couldn’t be related to her mould exposure – she had moved, there was no way she could still be sick. She gave up. “I was so tired I really hoped the next fever would kill me. I didn’t try to find any help any more. In a way, life was over.”Linda has sick building syndrome, or SBS, a controversial condition with many definitions and symptoms and even more proposed explanations. A basic definition is that it’s an illness a person gets from a building they live or work in. Speculated causes have included dust, microbes, carpets, ventilation and, like in Linda’s story, mould. Other researchers have claimed there are psychological forces at play, that SBS is related to anxiety, dissatisfaction at home or work, or other mental conditions. Sick building syndrome was a common term in the 1980s and 1990s. It has since faded out of use in the US, where I live, but continues to be studied and discussed in Nordic countries like Denmark and Finland.Origami-inspired skyscraper designed for disaster zones wins contestI came to Helsinki to meet members of an online SBS community, including Linda. Another member of the group, Jesse*, a slim 17-year-old with dyed blonde hair, tells me that he and his mum also had to leave their home. “I was getting sick every winter and summer when the temperature dropped,” he says. “I got the flu, I got headaches, my legs hurt, my head hurt, rashes on my skin, everything like that.” They found mould growing in the walls of their house and had to desert their clothes, all their furniture. “Everything,” he says. Family photos were salvaged and wrapped in plastic. They are going to make photocopies of them through their coverings. Jesse says he often has reactions at school. Sometimes he has to do his classwork in the hallways, away from other students. His visits to the doctor didn’t yield any help. “Because it wasn’t any sort of flu or any kind of bacteria or virus, we were all right,” he says. The doctors told them there was nothing wrong.In 2013, Linda found a doctor who thought he could help, and through “nutritional therapy” she eventually felt well enough to rejoin the world. She doesn’t think her illness and sensitivity will ever go away, but within months of starting treatment, she managed to go on a skiing trip with her daughter.Others are not so lucky. Maria*, 40, says that doctors in Finland are too quick to label SBS as psychological. In 2012, she got sick from her office where she worked in child services. She would get stomach pains, infections, high blood pressure – all medical issues she had never had before. In 2014, mould was found in the building but, despite loving her work, she had already left the job. By 2015, she wasn’t able to go into other buildings too. But being diagnosed with SBS in Finland does not open up access to support.“When I got sick, there was no place for me to go,” says Maria. “I couldn’t get any money. No sick pay, nothing. No rehabilitation, no retraining in a new profession, no unemployment benefit. I was being left out without any rights at all, with nothing.”There must be a psychosocial element, some research claimed. How else to explain that women are more likely to have SBS than men? Or that employees’ wellbeing could be associated with floor plans and office arrangement, office noise or how much control they had over their environment? Hedge’s own work examined SBS questionnaire answers from thousands of workers in various buildings. “We didn’t find any evidence of an actual syndrome. In other words, no consistent pattern of all of the symptoms.” In the end, he says, they “don’t really know whether it’s the building or it’s the people”.Hedge has had a long career of tackling building-related health problems and says the “building or people” puzzle isn’t easy to solve. In one of his cases, people felt ill only in the mornings between 09.30 and 10.00. When the air was tested (later in the day), nothing unusual was detected. Hedge eventually found a cause that explained the odd timing: carbon monoxide from the morning’s arriving cars was rising into the office through elevator shafts.An office in Montreal with 2,000 employees was on the verge of evacuation because of a bad odour. Hedge says everyone was worried it was a “sick building” and that their health had been affected. He found only a couple of mouldy oranges left in the desk of an employee on vacation. Smelly, but not dangerous. “But the reaction,” he points out, “it was a genuine reaction. You smell something, you don’t know what it is. You’ve heard there is a problem and pretty quickly you can feel bad.” After SBS had peaked, Hedge says he started to hear about another disorder: multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). People who claim they have it say they can be intolerant to any chemicals or materials in any building. I ask Hedge to apply his standard line of inquiry: is it caused by the buildings or the people?“I have no doubt that they have a problem,” he says diplomatically. “The question is, how much is that problem related to their environment or how much is it related to what they think might be in the environment?” The bigger problem, Hedge says, is that people who suffer from SBS or MCS often get lost in the medical system. They’re shuttled between medical doctors who can’t find anything wrong with them physically and psychiatrists who say their symptoms are imagined. Neither offer treatment. People can end up homeless, broke and feeling cynical about doctors and therapists alike, just like it has played out in Finland.“Over time, these people will find each other,” he says. “And then when they find each other, it’s like the Flat Earth Society. They reinforce each other. These are people who are desperate for an explanation for what’s happening to them. And in the absence of that, all they have is their imagination.”On a frigid morning at a cafe in downtown Helsinki, Anna* orders a hot chocolate. She tells me there are thousands of people in Finland who are sick from indoor mould exposures, who have been told they are crazy, referred to psychiatrists, have lost their jobs, left vacant furnished houses and, in some cases, destroyed their homes. True to Hedge’s advisory, she also belongs to the group of people with SBS and MCS from indoor mould who meet in Helsinki every few months.Her own experience began when she started getting frequent coughs, colds and flu-like symptoms in the summer of 2014. At first, she attributed them to her grandchildren, whom she was babysitting on the weekends. You know kids, she tells me – they always want to “puss”, she says, puckering her lips and miming kisses in the air. But her health steadily got worse. She always felt tired, her voice would disappear and she would cough all the time.Anna is a medical doctor and worked in a hospital at the time. “We had occupational doctors, and I went and said, ‘Something strange is happening to me.’” She wondered whether her immunity had somehow been compromised? Was her thyroid damaged? Did she have HIV?Linda uses a blue light to sterilise her belongings“We took all the tests I suggested and everything was clear. I started to think about very unusual things. I am a doctor, but could not understand.” When she went on sick leave for a week, her voice returned. Back at the hospital, it disappeared again and the coughing returned. That’s when she started to think it was related to the building.Anna tells me that she had heard about mould illness before she got sick, but she didn’t consider that it was happening to her. Until, that is, her technicians found a large mushroom growing in the lab next to her office. Her boss told her that they would renovate, and that when she returned from sick leave she would work in a different office on a different floor, away from the lab. When she went back in January 2015, her symptoms started up again. Doctors told her there was no logical explanation. “They said that I am afraid,” she says. “That I was imagining. It was so offensive.”Her last day at work was in February 2015, when a technician pointed out how strange her breathing sounded. Anna says it was a wake-up call: “I tried with all my efforts,” she says. “I thought that I should overcome, I should stand it. And the technician said to me, ‘No, you are not breathing well.’ And then I looked at myself, and I thought, ‘This is really crazy, I will kill myself.’”Eventually, she found herself in the position of so many people with SBS. She wanted to work, she loved her profession – but how can you have a job without being able to go into a building? Instead, she started to research mould-related illness and its after-effects and to work out her rights.I ask her what she thinks about psychological treatment, which is often turned to in the absence of any confirmed physical cause. Even if their illness wasn’t caused by mental problems, couldn’t someone who has lost everything benefit from therapy? She is adamant in her answer: “Psychiatric therapy? No. They don’t need it. They need new apartments. A place to stay. A place where they can breathe. They are strong people, they have overcome such difficult situations. They don’t need this ‘blah blah blah’. They need real help, real support.” Linda left her former home after developing a mould-related illnessAnna doesn’t strike me as an imaginative hypochondriac. She is level-headed, forceful, clear and has a seemingly perfect memory. There is no doubt in my mind not to believe her, and the debate over mould illness and SBS seems ridiculous. They found a huge mushroom in her office, how could there be any dispute?I continued to think this about pretty much every mould sufferer I met: most had documentation to show me the proof of mould contamination found in their home or office. How could a real mould exposure be considered psychological? But I soon recognised that it wasn’t that initial exposure being contested. It was the continuation of symptoms – the cough and breathing problems that Anna had, even after the mushroom had been removed, the lab renovated and she relocated to a “clean” office. Those were the symptoms that were harder to explain and impossible, according to Anna, for doctors and insurance companies to accept were real and deserving of “real” help and support instead of psychiatric help.Anna says that one of the most upsetting parts of her illness was being disappointed by her own profession. “I was so perplexed because I am a medical doctor, I always wanted to help people,” she tells me. “I was taught I should believe what patients tell me about their illness, I should do my best. And when I was in the position of a patient, nobody really wanted to help me. Why is that?”Eventually, though, like others in her group, she found the one doctor who would believe her symptoms were real.Ville Valtonen, a bald 73-year-old in a pressed coat and a dark cap, waves me over to his car. We’re driving to Helsinki University Central Hospital, where he worked for more than four decades. His SBS history lesson is the same as Hedge’s: the energy crisis led to a change in building practices, and the patients followed. The first ones he saw came in the late 1980s. They would be previously healthy, usually early middle-aged people who had started getting repeated infections. The laboratory was refurbished but still Anna’s symptoms persistedValtonen’s career then was centred on the link between strokes and infection. Now, in his retirement, he is returning to the mystery of those early patients. He is one of the few doctors in Finland who is willing to give mould patients a diagnosis, which he calls Dampness and Mould Hypersensitivity Syndrome.Valtonen defines five stages of the disease. They’re based, he says, on the progression of the syndrome that he’s seen in the hundreds of people he’s treated. First, a history of exposure to mould in water-damaged buildings, then an increase in infections. Third comes SBS, and fourth, MCS. Finally, an enhanced scent sensitivity, meaning a person is extremely sensitive to the smell of moulds, “a hundred-fold more accurate than normal,” he says. In Valtonen’s model, SBS is just one factor of the overall illness. He says there is still hope for a mould-exposed patient with only SBS, because their symptoms will stay away if they avoid any source of mould or chemical that triggers them. “But if the patient has gone forward to this mould and chemical sensitivity, it is almost impossible to cure completely,” he says. “And if you have electromagnetic sensitivity, it’s hopeless.”Although he tells me that many of his patients have it, I’m sceptical of this symptom, as repeated studies have shown that participants cannot tell when they’re being exposed to electromagnetic fields. He says many of his mould patients can no longer use mobile phones. Some develop chronic fatigue syndrome, unable to walk even 10 metres others develop epileptic seizures, but show normal electrical activity in the brain when tested. That’s a lot of different symptoms, I venture, so what does he think is going on? Valtonen says he can’t e into researching the mechanism as deeply as he would like. “I’m 73 and I’m too old to get any grants and do anything, so I’m only going to see those patients I have now,” he tells me. His theory is that the illness involves an immunological reaction that combines with secondary infections. Insurance broker warns toxic mould could become the \u0027new asbestos\u0027Many of his SBS patients describe Valtonen as the doctor they were lucky to find. He was a turning point in their illness, a moment when they could finally get better, because he gave them a diagnosis. But as we talk, I’m struck by how he doesn’t really offer treatment – his advice is simply to avoid any and all triggering exposures. The most valuable thing he provides, I think, is his acceptance of the biological nature of their symptoms.“I can’t be a doctor who doesn’t believe, what is that?” he says as we leave the hospital. “In my 45-year clinical career I’ve very seldom, very seldom seen patients who lied to me.”But as I would soon find, it’s not always as simple as being lied to or told the truth. When I meet Kirsi Vaali, Merja Lindström and Mikko*, they excitedly tell me something that I want to believe: Mikko is a mould patient they have cured. Lindström is a homeopath and Vaali is a biomedical researcher at the University of Helsinki. Before researching mould, Vaali studied food allergies and chronic fatigue syndrome – she has an interest in diseases that others cast off as psychological, she says. She emphatically tells me that mould illness is actually related to mitochondrial damage, and that she has a candidate gene that could predict susceptibility.This is the moment when doubts begin to surface in my mind. It was easier to offer my belief, as Valtonen does, to the patients. Their stories weren’t focused so much on medicine or mechanism, but on life, and the ways it was taken from them when they started to feel sick. Now, faced with the “science” of this disease, I find my faith wavering. In 48 short hours, I’ve been told this illness is an innate immune system problem, an inflammation problem, an autoimmune disorder, a blood-brain barrier issue, an oxidative stress problem, and now mitochondrial damage and a genetic disorder? I have yet to see any data and I want details. Has Vaali taken blood samples from patients? Could they see or measure mitochondrial damage in people with SBS? What, I ask, is the connection between immune system function and mitochondria?Vaali and Mikko start laughing, and I worry I’ve asked a stupid question. In fact, I’ve asked a fundamental one that they have no idea how to answer. Vaali shrugs: “That question is impossible to answer.”In the course of our conversation, Vaali adds to a growing list of putative mechanisms and symptoms, telling me that women are more susceptible because of their hormones, because toxins go into fat stores and because of a lack of liver enzymes, and that mould patients have altered sleep rhythms. Instead of going into scientific detail on these topics, Vaali and Lindström mostly want to talk about how patients could be helped. Using Mikko as a case study, they tell me that through homeopathy and natural supplements, these people can be “rescued”. What are these miracle supplements? Vaali won’t tell me straight away, and neither will Lindström. I ask no less than four times over two hours, tolerating digressions and caveats that for each person it is a little different, or that I probably don’t have the same supplements abroad. At last, Vaali shows me Mikko’s regimen, made up of very basic vitamins and nutrients. Most are supplements that I also currently take. Vitamin B, iron, omega-3, curcumin (the active ingredient in turmeric) and a few blends of fatty lipids. Vaali also advises against eating gluten, and Lindström says only organic food is allowed. Cheese and other mouldy foods are bad, because those can be triggers. Wine is OK, but only organic wines with no additives. Litigation fear over toxic mould invading one in four UK homesI begin to have a gnawing feeling, one I’d suppressed when I heard that Valtonen makes patients better without doing much of anything, or that “nutritional therapy” had turned Linda’s life around. I haven’t yet doubted the illness or its symptoms, but its alleged treatment is stirring up suspicions. If SBS is purely a physiological disease, caused by something as serious as an immune disorder or mitochondrial damage, how can it be “rescued” with vitamin B?Lindström shows me her homeopathic pills that she takes for mould illness, which I look over with raised eyebrows. I try to keep an open mind, but I know that homeopathic medicines have such low concentrations of active ingredients they can’t possibly have any biological effect. I do think that healthy eating and lifestyle can help overall mental and physical health – and the treatment of chronic disease. What I question is their application as a fix-it for a specific pathology, especially one that’s unknown. We have a link between saturated fat and heart disease, but what is the link between gluten-free organic food and decreased sensitivity to chemicals? Biodynamic wine and electrical sensitivity? Homeopathic arsenic tablets and mycotoxins? Mikko senses my scepticism. He tells me he doesn’t believe in this stuff either. He’s a general practitioner and a child psychiatrist, and let the supplements sit in his closet for nine months before trying them. He rejected the homeopathic pills and affectionately calls Lindström a “witch doctor”. But he does believe that the supplements helped make him feel better.Mikko bought a new house in 2003, and his symptoms began in 2007. By the autumn, he was living in a campervan on the street. He says that when all his symptoms – itching, headache, nausea, throat and nose irritation, and eczema – hit at once, it was like “burning in a hell”. He suffered for five years before finding relief with Vaali and Lindström’s treatment. He says it took one or two months to improve at the same time, the ventilation in his house was being cleaned. He attributes his recovery to the combination of both. Mikko has been in psychotherapy for years. He tells me he knows himself very well and is sure this isn’t a psychological disease. “I think different kinds of psychotherapy can help people to stand the hell that they are living,” he says. “But not to cure them from the biological disease that they have.”Later, I get Linda’s list of nutritional therapies. She too is being “cured” with supplements, and I want to compare her regimen. It’s a lot of the same: fatty acids, high doses of B and other vitamins, curcumin, etc. It’s broken down into parts of the day: before breakfast, breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, lunch, after lunch, before dinner… and at least three or four pills each time. Whenever you finish taking your last supplement, you begin gearing up to take the next one.Part of me feels glad she has a solution that works for her, and the same with Mikko. But it also feels like they’re being chained to something else. Whereas the sickness used to control their lives, now it’s the diagnosis and the cure.I take a break for lunch, appreciating the brisk air on my face. As I walk, I think about how much my attitude has changed since I arrived. I’m upset because I feel close to the mould sufferers for reasons I haven’t disclosed to them. That feeling of knowing you’re sick, but being told by doctors that you’re not – I know that feeling.Throughout my life, I’ve regularly gone to the doctor for unexplained symptoms. I’ve gotten scans and painful tests for which, over and over, the results would come back normal. I’ve had three doctors, in different specialities, try to prescribe me antidepressants for physical symptoms. Recently, I struggled with idiopathic dysphagia, meaning I was having trouble swallowing – even choking at times – but there was no reasonable explanation. I had been diagnosed a few years earlier with laryngopharyngeal reflux, a version of acid reflux some gastroenterologists aren’t sure exists because there often isn’t any measurable acid in the throat. I have fallen into natural remedy black holes too, hoping to find the magical supplement that cures me. I go beyond what Vaali and Lindström offer, though never to homeopathy. I add super greens powders to my smoothies, powdered liquorice to help with digestion, digestive enzymes and L-glutamine to help my stomach lining.As a science writer and the child of scientists, I justify a lot of my actions by consulting research. Deep down though, I know that my relationship with my body and the way it feels comes both from how it “really” feels and how I’ve been taught to react to it. In my childhood home, food was labelled for when it would go bad and each person had a hand towel just for them, to control the spread of germs. Going to the doctor, requesting unusual medical tests, searching for something in the body gone wrong – this was the environment I grew up in, a kind of “sick building” in itself. People can end up homeless, broke and feeling cynical about doctors and therapistsA specialist who observed my swallowing, and saw nothing wrong, warned me that if I kept treating my body as if my swallowing was broken, I could, in fact, break it. By not using the muscles in my throat, I could create a weakness and then have a real problem. “No need to create a real issue out of nothing,” she said.Her advice frightened me into eating solid foods again. But I remember thinking: isn’t my issue already “real”?I have always looked at my body as a potential battleground Anna and the others in Helsinki have not. Something clearly happened to them. Could the very real exposure to a toxic mould have pushed them into seeing their body through new eyes? Shown them that this is all it takes for your health to be taken away? That it could be something invisible, growing in the walls, in the air you breathe? It’s such a violation, perhaps other walls start to break down. The wall between emotions and body, thoughts and physical feeling. Perhaps that wall was never there, but they thought it was – and that exposure, that violation, broke the illusion.Risto Vataja, head of the neuropsychiatric clinic at Helsinki University Central Hospital, believes SBS in Finland to be a contagion of ideas rather than a disease. He tells me SBS is so well-known here that it’s common to believe that houses are dangerous, schools and hospitals are dangerous, that any place you go, your health is at risk. He says the media plays a big role in disseminating fear, and he scrutinises my intentions with this story. Later, he will email me to say, “Good luck with your article, and don’t make people sick, you journalists have the power...” Still, he hesitates to call SBS a psychiatric or psychosomatic disorder, instead preferring the word “functional”, which is also used to describe conditions like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome. “Functional means that they are not psychiatric,” he emphasises. “Psychology is probably involved in the mechanism, and we know that in patients with functional disorders. So, they are real symptoms, but we just cannot identify any good physiological explanation.”Vataja is an advocate for psychological help, like cognitive behavioural therapy. That advocacy probably explains the trouble he’s had reaching patient groups, who tend to reject any psychological component. “We agree that we are not able to help them enough,” he says. “We agree that the healthcare system has not thought enough about these problems, and that we don’t have enough research. We have lots of common things that we agree on and we should try to build on those.”Vataja thinks that telling patients to avoid all buildings that make them feel sick only furthers the illness. “Some colleagues of mine can increase the burden of these patients,” he says. I had seen Ville Valtonen’s unwavering belief as a source of relief for his patients, but was he at the same time perpetuating the disease? Did they have mould illness before they went to see him, or only after? Valtonen remains convinced that avoidance is the best available treatment – although he accepts that controlled studies to prove this theory would be beneficial.I turn to Juha Pekkanen, head of the Department of Public Health at the University of Helsinki and a researcher at the National Institute for Health and Welfare. He tells me that, according to studies they’ve done comparing European countries, Nordic countries should be less prone to dampness and mould. There’s less humidity and very dry air during their cold winters. There might be a slight chance of more exposure because people spend more time inside, or that dry winter air could add irritation to respiratory systems, but there’s no solid reason why there is more mould illness – except for the fact that people know about it. “We know worry causes symptoms and causes disease,” he says, “so we want to build trust and reduce worry.”He is one of the researchers assigned to set up a governmental programme to provide aid to people with SBS. How? “It’s not obvious yet, but of course we need to help these people. There are people who are living in tents and bad situations. Anybody within a bad situation we should somehow extend a hand and try to help them.”It was encouraging to hear someone affiliated with the government saying this, because some patients had suggested there was little care for their outcomes. Pekkanen says that’s not true, but he thinks a focus on mechanism and diagnosis has clouded the issue. He hopes that whatever they design to help people will be more practical. Jesse and his mother left their home for a new apartment block when he started getting sick“I think we should try to get them back to the society, and not build separate communities somewhere in the woods with no electricity, no chemicals, no nothing. There’s no end to that,” he says. “That’s not going to help these people. If you just focus on making it cleaner and cleaner and cleaner, it stops never.”He doesn’t think they’re “playing sick” though. Why would you pretend to have an illness that is not approved for compensation? He thinks that once a person encounters an issue with indoor air, they get real irritation and respiratory symptoms. But once they have these symptoms, some people begin to expect something more, something more sinister. “For many people, it is likely due to some kind of nocebo effect. You’ve heard about the nocebo effect?” he asks me. “Basically, expectation. I don’t like this categorisation between physical and psychological, I think it’s been shown we’re one whole, our psyche and self are intertwined, inseparable.”The placebo effect pervades much of the history of medicine, and explains why in the past some remedies, surgeries and treatments appeared to work despite our now knowing they are inert. More recently, attention has turned to nocebo, the reverse effect. The two aspects of nocebo effects are negative expectations and conditioning. Negative expectations are when you assume an outcome will be bad and then perceive it to be so. This has been shown in studies where patients experience side-effects to sham treatments only because they were warned about those side-effects in advance. Conditioning can occur when you associate a certain activity, place, drug (or anything) with a feeling or symptom. Studies of positive conditioning have shown that patients can find relief from allergic rhinitis symptoms through conditioning with a flavoured drink, can have conditioned immunosuppression and conditioned growth hormone increase. It’s been speculated that some of the negative side-effects of chemotherapy can be attributed to negative conditioning. But calling something placebo or nocebo doesn’t mean it’s not real or physical. “Neuroscientific investigations from the last 15 years have shown that the placebo effect is in fact a real biological phenomenon due to the psychosocial context of the patient and the therapy,” authors of a 2013 review wrote. Nocebo effects are associated with changes in several brain areas, neurotransmitters and hormones.Keith Petrie, a professor of health psychology at the University of Auckland, has studied how nocebo effects can stem from the idea that the environment, medicine, architecture and technological advances in food are causes of poor health. In 2001, the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry had announced they would be spraying insecticide to eradicate an invasive moth species, the painted apple moth. Petrie surveyed 292 residents about their current health symptoms and any health worries they had, then followed up after spraying. Higher levels of worry were associated with a higher number of symptoms attributed to the spray programme.“If people believe that they’re sensitive about a particular stimulus and then they’re exposed to it, then they report symptoms,” he says.When I ask him how Finland’s mould patients could possibly feel better from natural supplements, or from seeing a doctor who doesn’t give them medicine, Petrie says: “The good thing about treatment, any kind of treatment, is it shifts your perceptions. You go to somebody with a problem and say you’ve got the flu or a cold – you’re focused on how terrible you feel and your headache and your cough. You go to see someone and they give you a treatment and the way you’re viewing your illness shifts immediately. Instead of looking at how sick you are, you look for signs of recovery.” But it can go the other way too. Research has shown that placebo and nocebo effects can also be triggered by interactions with a doctor, even if your doctor tries to empathise with you. A 2015 review concluded that “reassuring patients that there is nothing physically wrong with them, when they are in a great deal of pain, can leave them feeling misunderstood and delegitimised”. Another study looked at doctor-patient interactions in patients who complained of symptoms but had no diagnosis. They were assigned to two groups, one where the doctor said they didn’t know what was wrong and another where the patient was given a firm diagnosis and reassured they would be better in a few days. After two weeks, 64 per cent of the patients in the group with a diagnosis reported getting better while only 39 per cent of those in the group without did. If there’s one thing common to all the mould patients, it’s being dismissed by doctors and being told their symptoms were unexplained. After reading these findings, I wonder if their true toxic exposure was to this uncertainty. It seems it can be harmful to your health to hear that what’s taking place in your body is a mystery. There are researchers who haven’t given up on this mystery and are hunting for a biological explanation. Thomas Dantoft, at the Centre for Clinical Research and Prevention in Denmark, is looking for biomarkers: differences somewhere in the body between people with MCS or other functional disorders and those without. He is also project coordinator for the Danish study of Functional Disorders (DanFunD), the first large, coordinated epidemiological study focusing exclusively on functional disorders.The cohort includes 9,656 men and women who were surveyed for fibromyalgia, whiplash-associated disorder, MCS, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome and bodily distress syndrome. The study includes interviews and personality tests and collects plasma, DNA, urine, gut bacteria and more. Participants will be followed until 2020 and hopefully will provide some much-needed epidemiological information. Because it isn’t just the sufferers who have numerous conflicting hypotheses about the cause of their illness. I spent weeks reading different papers – ning decades of research – on biological causes of MCS. Several implicated the immune system, validating one of the theories I was told in Helsinki, but other work contradicted them. One of Valtonen’s stages of the disease is an increased sense of smell, but Dantoft says that his and other studies have shown that isn’t true. What about psychological factors? Dantoft says he isn’t sure either way. He says functional disorder patients live in dire conditions and it would be incredible if they didn’t get depressed. “All studies working with MCS and other sorts of disorders, whatever you want to call them, show that there is higher risk of anxiety and depression,” he says. “But we don’t really know what comes first, and that also doesn’t mean that they are making it up. Maybe people who are at higher risk of getting depressed also have a higher risk of getting MCS? But that doesn’t mean you can cure MCS by treating the depression, necessarily.”Dantoft thinks mental help could be offered not as a fix, but as a stand-in until more is known. “The big issue is that the patients and the clinicians aren’t being honest with each other,” he says. “Because the fact is we have absolutely no efficient treatment to offer these people.” Is the building sick, or are the people? I’m frustrated that I’m no closer to answering this question. I also feel guilt. Guilt that my reporting led me to question the experiences of the people I met in Helsinki, and for my nagging intuition that there is more going on than just mould exposure. Faced with the option of building or people, real or not real, I still can’t settle on one.When I ask Linus Andersson, a cognitive scientist at Umeå University in Sweden, he tells me why: it’s been the wrong question all along. He is collaborating with chemist Anna-Sara Claeson, and together they are doing the most comprehensive work that I could find on mould and toxin exposure in people who report that they have MCS. “I have felt pushed towards choosing whether or not I would follow psychological or medicalbiological lines of work,” he says. “But I came to the conclusion that it’s not even a real question. Or, there is an answer: it is always both.”For the past decade, Claeson and Andersson have been exposing people to different compounds and measuring any effects on blood flow using brain scans, inflammatory markers in the mucus from the upper airways and, recently, gene expression. Over Skype, they show me their exposure chamber, which looks a bit like a phone booth – only with no phone. In this tiny room is where most of their experiments take place. In an experiment published in 2015, they exposed participants with MCS (along with controls) to a compound called n-butanol, which they chose because people find it hard to decide whether it smells good or bad. For the first ten minutes there was nothing, then the n-butanol increased to a set level and plateaued. MCS participants, compared with controls, reported greater perceived odour intensities, more unpleasantness from the exposure, and increasing symptoms over time. The MCS group also reported more symptoms in the 10 minutes before they were exposed to anything. Andersson thinks this could be associated with nocebo-like expectations, but he also says that to him, expectations producing symptoms doesn’t mean that an illness is imagined.He tells me that people often have allergic reactions without a “real” exposure. In a 2007 study on food allergies, it was found that children could have reactions to placebos: more than one in 10 of the food challenges produced false positives. The symptoms were real: intense bodily responses like rashes, hives, diarrhoea and vomiting. Claeson and Andersson say this shows that the body is very good at predicting and defending itself from what it thinks will be damaging, which should make researchers cautious when interpreting nocebo and placebo results. In a 2017 paper, Claeson and Andersson describe exposing people with chemical intolerance (along with controls) to the chemical acrolein. Chemicals are detected in the upper airways by the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. The olfactory nerves are involved in smell, while the trigeminal nerves can evoke irritation or pain. They found that people with MCS reported greater irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, even when acrolein’s smell was masked. Because their aggravated symptoms didn’t require them to be smelling the chemical, Andersson and Claeson think perhaps people with MCS could have altered trigeminal reactivity, and will continue to look into that.No study they’ve done yet has offered the mechanism of MCS on a silver platter. Andersson says their goal is to find some kind of exposure that separates an MCS sufferer from a control. It doesn’t matter what it is if they can find it, he thinks it would lead to a better understanding of how and why these patients respond differently. What does he think about natural supplements or homeopathy “curing” MCS? “My answer to this question is basically the same as for that pertaining to explanatory theories – the claims need to be backed up with data,” he replies. “When, or if, homeopathic treatment regimens would actually fulfil scientific criteria, then I would not be against it per se. I have yet to see such studies, however. So, my question for everyone who makes theories and statements of how MCS can be treated is – where’s the structured data?”I asked Vaali and Lindström so many times to tell me about their supplements, and their lack of data pushed me away from their cause rather than towards it. But while Andersson and Claeson’s mindset and careful research are refreshing, it’s all still exploratory. Unlike Vaali and Lindström, their work doesn’t offer an easy solution someone can take today, right now. It doesn’t allow patients to move from the world of the sick to the world of the well. What Andersson and Claeson can provide now is relief from all those dichotomies: building or person sick or well organic or made up. I can’t tell you if SBS or MCS or mould illness is “real”, but I know now that our definition of real is flawed. The split between psychological and physical is flawed the idea that psychological isn’t real is flawed the notion that psychological is not inherently physiological is flawed. These isions are what led to this health crisis in Finland, not abnormal levels of mould. I went to Helsinki and was asked to believe. And I do. I believe that Anna’s symptoms are real. I believe that Maria was mistreated by doctors and by her employers, that Jesse and his mother felt alone, and that Linda was neglected by her housing company. I believe that they should be helped. But I have one belief that I worry disqualifies all the others. I also believe that, after an initial mould exposure has been resolved, understanding the continuation of any symptoms must include a consideration of the mind. It pains me to know that the people I interviewed in Helsinki, who so graciously shared their stories, time and vulnerability with me, will probably be displeased with my version of their story. This is not the exposé they were hoping for, not a condemnation of the Finnish government nor the uncovering of a plot to keep mould patients quiet to avoid the costs of rebuilding and social security. People at the hospitals and National Institute for Health and Welfare sounded seriously concerned and are implementing programmes like the one Pekkanen mentioned to try to bridge the gap between officials and patient groups who feel wronged. Claeson says that while researchers can’t yet give people a cure, they can do their best to keep looking, keep trying to help. That in itself is a kind of belief.

In fact, the strangeness of our own universe might better be explained by an undiscovered natural law, they said.The idea of the multiverse comes about because in physics terms, our universe is very lucky to exist at all.Scientists launch huge survey to find alien lifeCurrent theories predict there should be much more dark energy inside of our own universe than there is. That is a problem because adding more dark energy would lead it to expand so quickly that any matter would be diluted before it could form the stars or planets that we need to live.In response to that, some have suggested that we might in fact be living inside of a multiverse. There are in fact lots of different universes – many of which will have more dark energy and so could not host life – and we simply live inside one that worked out in the right way.But the new study suggests that we might have been overstating how lucky we are. It might actually be possible for stars and planets to form even if there is much more dark energy.“We asked ourselves how much dark energy can there be before life is impossible?” said Pascal Elahi, a research fellow at the University of Western Australia. ”Our simulations showed that the accelerated expansion driven by dark energy has hardly any impact on the birth of stars, and hence places for life to arise. Even increasing dark energy many hundreds of times might not be enough to make a dead universe.”It is still true that our universe could be very special. But it does not need to be quite so special, the researchers showed.“The multiverse was previously thought to explain the observed value of dark energy as a lottery – we have a lucky ticket and live in the Universe that forms beautiful galaxies which permit life as we know it,” said Luke Barnes, a John Templeton research fellow at Western Sydney University.“Our work shows that our ticket seems a little too lucky, so to speak. It’s more special than it needs to be for life. This is a problem for the multiverse a puzzle remains.”That puzzling fact might suggest that the multiverse theory is not true in the first place. The study does not rule out the idea but does suggest that the small amount of dark energy in our universe would be better explained by a law of nature that we do not yet know about.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They have been in negotiations since Thursday in a bid to fuse their differing policies into a workable joint platform to end a 10-week political stalemate.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy’s prime minister“It has been a very productive day,” 31-year-old Mr Di Maio told reporters on Sunday, following several hours of talks with his counterpart in Milan.  He said they were close to a “historic” agreement, but their choice of prime minister has not yet been announced and confusion remains over who it will be.The Five Star Movement won 32 per cent of the vote at the election and the League took 17 per cent, making them the two largest groups in parliament.The leaders both said their talks on Sunday made progress on a policy document which is likely to be tough on immigration and the EU. Mr Salvini has previous pledged illegal immigrants would be rounded up and sent home “in 15 minutes” if he and his allies take power.The two parties are said to have agreed on who would be prime minister but there has been no word on who would lead the proposed government, with neither Mr Salvini nor Mr Di Maio willing to let the other take the helm.The far-right leader argues that, although his party has far fewer votes, he represents a centre-right alliance that won the support of 37 per cent of the electorate. That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

Brussels FURY at UK plan for Brexit satellite projectIn particular, third countries and their companies cannot participate in the development of security-sensitive matters.And in a dig at Brexit campaigners, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said: A decision has effects, consequences - this would probably signal the need for campaigns before one takes decisions that are well-informed, rather than managing the results of decisions afterwards that might bring some contradictions to the surface, but this is the state of play where we are.Once completed, Galileo will give Europe its own technology to rival the American global positioning system (GPS).It has been in development since 2003 and is due to be completed by 2020.Federica Mogherini took a swipe at Brexit campaigners for not foreseeing this outcomeThe Government has warned it will walk away from the programme and develop its own system if Brussels continues to prevent the UK from participating.Science Minister Sam Gyimah said it was extremely disappointing the bloc had decided to stop Britain from taking part in the secure elements of the project since the Brexit vote.He warned the EU that other member states would have to reimburse the UK with \u0026ldquobillions of pounds if it decides to withdraw completely.Mr Gyimah told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme: The EU is playing hardball with us.Galileo will give Europe its own, independent sat-nav systemWe have helped to develop the Galileo system. We want to be part of the secure elements of the system and we want UK industry to be able to bid for contracts on a fair basis.It is only on those terms that it makes sense for the UK to be involved in the project.This is a project that is of mutual benefit to the UK and the EU and if the UK is not part of the programme, it would cost EU members billions of pounds more to develop.Because of the implications for us in terms of defence and our national security, were we not to participate in Galileo we would look at alternative options and we will leave nothing off the table.That includes developing a British satellite navigation system."},{"url":null,"title":"weather","story":"BRITAIN is heading back into the furnace with a near straight run of blue skies and roasting...BBC Weather is forecasting another bout of glorious weather due to blast the UK despite...UK WEATHER will turn increasingly warm as the working week concludes and into the weekend before...THE UK is set to bake in warm weather this Bank Holiday weekend, as forecasts show temperatures...BRITAIN is braced for April showers as a miserable weather front enters bringing wet and soggy...BRITONS across the country are enjoying sweltering temperatures as the country basks in a mini...GET the suncream ready, summer is about to arrive early bringing what could be the hottest spell...BRITAIN is gearing up for the hottest weekend of the year so far with temperatures forecast to...A SNOW warning has been issued for Scotland on Tuesday while the rest of Britain soaks up..."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/153/590x/Regent-Street-959575.jpg","title":"royal wedding weather sun for harry and meghan","story":"It is set to be almost 20C in Windsor when Harry, 33, marries Meghan, 36, according to the Met Office, with the sun shining from around 10am until the evening.That is not only good news for the couple but also for the crowds of 100,000 expected to line the streets of Windsor to celebrate the wedding in St George\u0026rsquos Chapel within the castle.Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: \u0026ldquoThe week ahead will see a lot of fine weather from Monday, and that is likely to continue for the.\u0026ldquoEarly indications are for Saturday in Windsor to be dry and bright with highs around 18C, a touch above the 17C average.GettyRegent street royal wedding ready                Royal wedding 2018: Where will Meghan and Harry stay the night befo...

Heres what we know so far about who will be attending the big day.The wedding invitations were printed on March 22, and the couple have kept fairly tight-lipped about their guest list.There wont be as many wedding guests as when Prince William tied the knot in 2011, but it has been confirmed that Harrys older brother will be the best man.Prince William and Kate Middletons wedding took place at Westminster Abbey, with 1,900 guests but St Georges chapel, Harry and Meghans venue, can hold 800 people.They will also invite 2,640 members of the public on the day to the Windsor Castle grounds including 1,200 people, who have demonstrated strong leadership in their communities. Around 600 people have been invited to the service which takes place at St Georges Chapel on Saturday May 19.Unfortunately those wanting a glimpse of Prince Louis on the day will be disappointed, as the palace has confirmed he wont be attending - instead being cared for by a nanny nearby on the day.The older Cambridge children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, will attend the day and are involved in the service.On Harrys invite list were ushers Tom Inskip and Guy Pelly, it is likely some Army comrades who he served alongside in Afghanistan also made the cut.Meghans older half-siblings, Thomas Markle Jr and Samantha Markle, have not be invited on the big day.Her nephew, Thomas Jrs son Tyler Dooley, and his mum Tracey Dooley, are also rumoured to have been left off the guest list. Meghans mum, Doria Ragland, will be attending, and her father, Thomas Markle Sr, had plananed to walk his daughter down the aisle.However, on May 14th, US media reported that he had been struck down by a heart problem and pulled out of the ceremony after realising he might be too ill to make the trip.All three of Princess Dianas siblings will be in attendance - Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer. Lady Jane Fellowes will be giving the reading.A fleet of glamorous pals including tennis ace Serena Williams, Indian actress Priyanka Chopra, stylist Jessica Mulroney and Made In Chelsea’s Millie Mackintosh are considered among those who may be chosen to be bridesmaids.Protocol normally means that royal brides do not have adult bridesmaids, although Kate’s sister Pippa Middleton was an obvious exception to this rule, and Kensington Palace released a statement suggesting Meghan would follow on from breaking tradition.At the very least, we’d expect to see a few of Meghan’s mates as guests at the wedding – as well as fashion designer Misha Nonoo, who’s thought to be the woman who set her and Harry up.Its inevitable that the wedding will be attended by a host of foreign royals.One man who seemed determined to get an invite is Anthony Joshua, one of Harrys guests during his special Radio 4 appearance – and he wants a starring role.It has also been reported that two of Prince Harrys former flames, Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy have both scored invites.Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and his wife, Princess Mabereng, who have worked alongside the Prince and his charity Sentebale since 2006.In addition to Donald Trump, a whole host of political big names including President Obama, his wife Michelle, and Theresa May have reportedly not made the cut.A Kensington Palace spokesman said: It has been decided that an official list of political leaders - both UK and international - is not required for Prince Harry and Ms Markles wedding.Her Majestys Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.The Sun has revealed that Elton John will be attending the Royal wedding.The Rocket Man has cancelled two Las Vegas gigs on the same May weekend as the Royal nuptials, which leaves him free to attend or even perform.The singer was a close friend of Harry’s mum Princess Diana and was among a handful of celebrities to attend Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding at Westminster Abbey in 2011.It was the same venue where he famously sang Candle in the Wind at Diana’s funeral in 1997.Mel B was speaking on US talk show The Real when she confirmed that all five of the Spice Girls were invited to the wedding.Unfortunately, Scary Spice did not budge when she was asked about the invitation or other details around the wedding.Mel sternly said: “Im not saying any more,” but when she was asked whether they would perform or not, she grinned and looked down at her hands.Victoria Beckham, aka Posh Spice, also confirmed she had received a coveted invitation.It was reported that the couple were keen to invite Barack Obama to the wedding rather than Trump - which had all the makings of a sticky political situation.The 33-year-old prince has become good friends with Obama and his wife Michelle since bonding with them during the Invictus Games.But government mandarins had pleaded with the couple to change their minds as Britains relations with Trumps White House sunk to their lowest ebb since his election last year.And as the big day approaches, some of the ushers, bridesmaids, page boys and flower girls have been revealed.Ushers:Bridesmaids:Flower girls:Page boys:The Sun Online exclusively revealed that Lady Amelia Windsor has been snubbed by the royal couple and she is not invited to the wedding.The Edinburgh student and her older sister Marina, 25, have failed to bag an invitation to the wedding of the year.A friend said: “They were a little surprised not to be invited as they were looking forward to going.“Amelia is creating quite a name for herself with her modelling and Instagram posts.“Perhaps Harry just wanted to keep the family invited to a small number or maybe he didn’t want anyone upstaging the bride.”Lady Amelia and Lady Marina are William and Harrys third cousins - granddaughters of the Duke of Kent who is the Queens cousin.Numerous members of the public are selected to watch outside the chapel when the couple get married. These include:The Suns Bizarre column exclusively revealed that the Foo Fighters have dropped hints they want to perform at the wedding.Frontman Dave Grohl said: “I’ve saved the date. The performance was good. It’s nice to feel like a wedding band when everyone’s at tables eating tiramisu.”The band, who picked up Best International Group at the Brit Awards 2018, played at Harry’s Invictus Games in 2014.Some performers have already been confirmed such as cello please Sheku Kanneh-Mason.Shortly after the engagement was announced, it was revealed that the wedding between Harry and Meghan will take place in May 2018.On December 15, Kensington Palace confirmed the ceremony will be held on Saturday, May 19, 2018.The wedding is taking place at St Georges Chapel, Windsor Castle, which is where Harry was christened when he was three months old.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scott might be 26 years her junior but he always strikes me as the “older” one in the relationship.It’s that sheer zest for life that Barbara has, even at 80, that makes this diagnosis so very sad and hard to bear.Scott decided to speak out because he felt he could no longer protect his beloved wife from people outside their close circle of friends and family hearing the truth.He became worried her illness would make her do or say something out of ­character that could upset her and others.He wants to be able to take his wife on ­ outings, and for her to still meet the public who love her and who will now ­hopefully understand if she’s having a “foggy” day.Scott also needs to make sure he takes care of himself and doesn’t get completely worn out looking after his wife.He hasn’t been able to leave her alone in the house recently, but now the truth is out he can let others take over while he at least has half an hour to himself.Anyone who cares for someone with dementia knows it is utterly exhausting, stressful and worrying, no matter how much you love them.I salute everyone who quietly and patiently deals with these day-to-day ­struggles. Scott is now free of the burden of keeping the secret and I hope he is finding strength from all of the messages of support for Barbara.She’s been part of many of our most-loved shows and we’ve grown up with “Our Babs”.I remember watching her wiggle and giggle her way through the Carry On films, where her sheer talent and perfect comic timing marked her out as a little superstar.Who could forget her enthusiastic arm flinging exercise routine in Carry On Camping that ended with her bra pinging off?And that incredible bikini made up of three shiny red hearts in Carry On Again Doctor made my pal Dr Hilary Jones decide to take up a career in medicine.As she more than proved during her reign in EastEnders, Barbara has always been so much more than a bubbly blonde dolly bird.She is one hell of an actress and was in her element behind the bar of The Queen Vic.It was her and Scott’s decision to kill off Peggy Mitchell when her memory began to fade.Barbara was having difficulty ­learning lines so felt she couldn’t give her very best performance.As it so happens, the scenes leading up to her character’s death were some of the best that ­Barbara, or any soap actress, has ever given on the small screen. Quite simply she is the real deal.I’ve been lucky enough to ­interview her many times over the years and it’s like catching up with an old friend.She’s open and honest and has never tried to cover up her ­mistakes or to sugar-coat the ups and downs of her life.When work was thin on the ground she painted on a smile, climbed into her shiny fairy godmother outfit and worked her backside off in provincial pantos.She was always quick to credit EastEnders for giving her a career comeback.I’ve seen her talking to fans outside the ­studio, always happy to pose for pictures, sign autographs and have a chat.She would leave everyone with a smile on their face and some happy memories.Her own powers of recall and her very bright light may be diminishing, but Scott and all her friends and family, and the public who adore her, will ensure she is wrapped in a soft blanket of love.She’s a class act and a very special woman.TAKE a bow Shayne Ward and all concerned with the deeply moving and hugely important storyline of Aidan’s suicide in Coronation Street.The subject was handled with great sensitivity.We saw Aidan feeling isolated and alone in the crowded Rovers, witnessed his fearful despair and heard his father’s anguished screams of grief through the closed bedroom door.There was no need to see his cold, dead body to understand what had happened. This really was Corrie at its finest.Richard Hawley as devastated dad Johnny and Catherine Tyldesley as poor bereaved Eva were exceptional, but what made me really blub was the authentic speech by Gail (Helen Worth) looking out of her window on to the iconic cobbled street, talking about how we all need to look after each other and that no one should suffer in silence.It was beautifully written and impeccably delivered.That’s what Corrie is all about.IT’S the one time of the year when our inevitable failure to win a massive trophy in Europe is a source of fun and amusement rather than humiliation. Because tonight is Eurovision.Our plucky Brit doomed to failure this time is SuRie, above, who is actually a good performer with a perfectly acceptable song, but even if the UK entry was Robbie Williams belting out Angels, we would still be near the bottom of the table or even doomed to the dreaded “nul points”.Many theories are put forward for our dire results over the past two decades.Some believe there are too many countries taking part (Australia and Israel are bizarrely considered part of Europe) which makes for more tactical voting, combined with an anti- British backlash made worse by Brexit.I reckon it’s simply because we don’t take it seriously enough, for which I’m very grateful, because I truly love Eurovision.We know we won’t win so it’s just an excuse for a party, a chance to wallow in the whole wonderful campfest and to chortle at Graham Norton’s snarky comments.My perfect evening.WHEN Kim Kardashian is the most elegant and tastefully dressed woman in the room, you know that something has gone horribly awry.So it was at the ludicrous Met Gala in New York, which saw a procession of show-offs dressing up like extras from the Monty Python sketch about the Spanish Inquisition.Madonna looked like Dracula’s mad old aunty, Sarah Jessica Parker had a nativity scene on her head, and don’t get me started on Rihanna, who came as some sort of sexy bishop mashed up with a pearly queen.It made Kim’s skin-tight gold sheath Versace dress appear to be the epitome of class.We are told the Pope approved this farrago, which was pompously entitled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion And The Catholic Imagination.His endorsement should make you shudder – until you realise that’s how he always dresses.He’s also a man with a passion for red leather Prada slip-ons, so I suppose he is more connected to the weird world of fashion than your average parish priest.A great deal of money is raised for good causes at this tacky celebration of fame and fortune, and that’s all well and good. But maybe next year they should stay at home and write a cheque.One thing is certain. You can be darned sure they won’t follow up the Catholic theme by making a mockery of Islam or Judaism.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it would take a brave man indeed to risk homophobic abuse from the stands and on social media.A few rugby players have found such courage. So has top rugby ref Nigel Owens. We suspect the vast majority of football fans wouldn’t bat an eyelid.They may even be hugely supportive.Clubs could operate zero tolerance towards anyone abusing a gay player.The first to come out would be a standard-bearer for others. And football could finally catch up with the sea-change in attitudes of the last 30 years.It is “a modern institution nothing like the rest of society”, according to the lover of the anonymous star on our front page.It’s time that changed.IT may come as a shock to the shrieking Left but most Brits back grammar schools and would happily send their kids to one.As indeed would many left-wing hypocrites currently moaning about them.Most people also believe they are good for social mobility. Which they are.The Sun is all for more grammar ­places so long as a generous proportion are guaranteed for children from low-income families — as they will be.We back more choice, smaller classes and higher standards. So does the nation.DONALD Trump has been given the usual kicking over Iran — but he may be right.Barack Obama’s dodgy deal freed the mullahs to spend billions spreading war and terrorism throughout Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza.Trump aims to halt that and punish the extremist regime. Who knows . . . maybe Iran’s people will finally revolt.Trump’s aggression and rash tweets have surprising upsides. He has helped propel North Korea towards peace.That’s more than Obama achieved during eight years of sonorous speeches which disguised dithering timidity.WHAT a surprise. A rabidly left-wing UN “racism inspector” sent to “find out” if Britain is more racist since the Brexit vote has decided — wait for it — we ARE!Her bogus “report” is a load of pre-meditated and vacuous bilge designed to bash ­Britain and the Leave vote.It must have irritated Tendayi Achiume to have to leave her home in the Californian sunshine for the charade of a 12-day UK tour amassing “evidence”.Here’s an idea, though.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We know how hard you have worked, but there is something very important you must know….The SATs tests do not assess all of what makes each of you exceptional and unique. The people who create these tests and score them do not know each of you the way that we do and certainly not in the way your families do.They do not know that some of you speak two languages or that you love to draw and paint. They have not seen your natural talent for acting or playing the ukulele. They do not know that you have entered story writing competitions or street dance competitions.They do not know that you have represented our school at Young Voices. They do not know that your friends can count on you to be there for them, that your laughter can brighten the darkest day or that your face turns red when you feel shy.They do not know that you participate in the school football team, the school netball team or the school cross country team.They do not know that you are obsessed with Harry Potter or Michael Rosen or flossing. They do not know that you wonder about your future, or sometimes help your brother or sister.They do not know that you are kind, trustworthy and thoughtful and that every day you try to be your very best.The outcomes you will get from these tests will tell you something, but they will not tell you everything.

I just said it’s dead, this baby is going to die.I had no confirmation of this as I wasn’t stood near to see, but I just knew. The baby’s heartbeat had dropped.I saw the baby’s legs coming out of the vagina, then she delivered up to the chest, it happened very quickly.”The tragic death happened on March 16, 2014, after the womans waters had broken early.It is alleged Dr Laxman should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency Caesarean section at the hospital in Dundee, as the baby was in a breech position.The hearing previously saw another doctor break down in tears as she recounted having to remove the babys head from his mothers uterus, saying: (It) is the most horrific experience anybody could have and it has haunted me so much.Dr Siddiki told the Manchester tribunal: “If she was fully dilated, the baby could be delivered vaginally but she never communicated with the patient about doing a vaginal delivery.We were set up for a C-section, she had a prolapsed cord and she was 25 plus 6 weeks gestated.I was under the impression we were going to do a C-section and this caused us a delay - I didn’t know what she was planning.After that I saw the feet coming out of the vagina. I admit I didn’t tell her to stop and I saw her pull on the legs.She added: Dr Laxman was encouraging the patient to push and she was pulling the baby down - this was not what I was expecting.I was speaking to another doctor who said how is she going to do it - how is she going to deliver the head.She told the hearing the attempt to pull the baby out last for about 15-20 minutes.Dr Laxman who faces being struck off denies contributing to the death of the baby.Lawyers for the General Medical Council said she should have performed a Caesarean instead of a natural delivery arguing a fragile baby like the infant who died would suffer a lot more damage if pulled or twisted.The tribunal had previously heard from the mother, known as Patient A, who said she had been assured she would be given a C-section in the event of a breech birth.Speaking to the distraught mother Dr Laxmans lawyer Gerard Boyle QC told her: “Dr Laxman has asked me to say she is so very sorry and deeply saddened for the outcome of your baby.The hearing continues."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000276124302.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cliveden house meghan markle doria ragland stay night before royal wedding","story":"The US actress will be joined by her mum Doria Ragland at the sprawling country estate -

MPs fear the cash piles are an “incentive to ride roughshod over claimants” by making tests rushed and inaccurate. The powerful Commons Work and Pensions Committee launched a probe into the policy tonight after being shown the letter by the Mirror. Atos staff assess four people per day for Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which gives disabled people up to \u0026pound141 a week. But the outsourcing giant wrote to its health professionals in May 2017 offering \u0026pound50 for every test they ran beyond four. The letter said “incentives” were being extended and invited health professionals to work overtime.  It added: “You’ll receive an additional \u0026pound50 for any assessment you do above four, within an assessment centre session, and three within a home consultation session.” It comes despite Atos failing to meet its target of 97% of tests being “acceptable” - and tribunals overturning more than 100,000 PIP assessments since 2013. The policy, which Atos told the Mirror was genuine, was shared online by an ex-assessor who said running more than four tests a day was “unrealistic”. “No amount of speed would allow me to complete a 5th, 6th and on most days a 4th report,” the assessor told the Mirror. “Every morning caused anxiety for me, knowing one claimant who required more probing questions could set the day back. “I would spend evenings exhausted and unmotivated and anxious.”  Tonight Work and Pensions Committee chairman Frank Field wrote to Atos demanding to know whether the policy was genuine, how widespread it was, and how Atos polices the quality of tests. He said the incentive was never mentioned in Atos’ evidence to his committee and claimed it would “go against everything” he was told. Mr Field’s letter to Atos states: “I am concerned financial incentives to complete assessments quickly may compromise the accuracy and quality of assessment reports - causing further distress to claimants.” He told the Mirror: “It’s an incentive to ride roughshod over claimants and it can’t be right.  “Not only has the Government outsourced the assessment work, it has outsourced moral responsibility for the welfare of claimants. This is the outcome.” Atos is the government’s largest provider of PIP assessments. Mr Field is also due to write to Capita, the other provider, and has not ruled out grilling bosses at the committee. Asked about the \u0026pound50 policy, a spokesman for Atos’ PIP assessments arm, Independent Assessment Services, confirmed: “It was a time-limited incentive in place last year in response to a period of high assessment volume and is not currently in use.” "},{"url":null,"title":"house lords defeat government revive","story":"NewsHouse of Lords defeat the government to revive plans for a new Leveson InquiryThe House of Lords defeated the government as it backed calls for a so-called \u0027Leveson 2\u0027 by 252 votes to 213\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter19:17, 14 MAY 2018Updated19:25, 14 MAY 2018NewsSir Brian Leveson led the first inquiry into the press (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPeers voted to resurrect a new Leveson Inquiry tonight despite warnings it could harm the freedom of the Press.

The vote pitches peers into conflict with the MPs just days after the House of Commons blocked plans for a second inquiry. The latest plan by crossbench peer Baroness Hollins will now be sent for approval by MPs, who are widely expected to block it. Baroness Hollins said there must be a further probe into criminality, corruption and abuse beyond the phone hacking that was the focus of Sir Brian Leveson\u0027s original probe. Moving her amendment to the Data Protection Bill, she said: In any other industry the press would be demanding an inquiry and yet their opposition is uniform.  Baroness Hollins\u0027 amendment would force the government to set up an inquiry into claims of data protection breaches by the media within three months of the Bill passing. She was backed by Labour and former civil service chief Lord Kerslake, who led an inquiry into the Manchester terror attack. Lord Kerslake said: People talked about being hounded and bombarded and having to force their way through scrums of reporters at hospitals who wouldn\u0027t take no for an answer. But former TV boss and Tory peer Lord Grade said: I suspect what lies behind this amendment is yet another attempt to exercise some statutory controls or levers over our free media. Any inquiry is bound to produce recommendations with the risk to free speech of some statutory device, overt or covert, buried in the recommendations. The amendment was opposed by some Crossbench peers and all but three Tories, including former party chair Baroness Warsi.

Donald Trump\u0027s decision to move the embassy makes the US the first nation in the world to have their HQ in the disputed city, a move which has sparked anger across the Middle East. At the opening ceremony Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu provocatively praised Israeli soldiers and called Jerusalem, which the eternal, undivided capital of Israel.  This is particularly incendiary because, although Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its united capital, and its annexation of East Jerusalem effectively put the entire city under de-facto Israeli control, Palestinian leaders see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Israeli forces have killed at least 52 Palestinians along the Gaza border, health officials said, while some 900 Palestinians were wounded, about 450 of them by live bullets.  It is the highest Palestinian death toll in a single day since the 2014 Gaza war. Tens of thousands streamed to the coastal enclave\u0027s land border on Monday, some approaching the Israeli fence - a line Israeli leaders said Palestinians would not be allowed to breach. Clouds of black smoke from tyres set alight by demonstrators rose in the air.  The Palestine Liberation Organization called a general strike across the West Bank and Gaza in response to the deaths.  The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said that PLO Executive Committee member Wasel Abu Yousef announced a complete strike across the Palestinian Territories to mourn the martyrdom of those killed in Gaza on Monday. At the embassy inauguration ceremony, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Trump for having the courage to keep your promises. What a glorious day for Israel, Netanyahu said in a speech. We are in Jerusalem and we are here to stay. Trump, who broke with other nations by moving the embassy from Tel Aviv, made a speech via video from 5,000 miles away in the White House.  In an address he said: Congratulations it\u0027s been a long time coming.  He continued: Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every sovereign nature to determine it\u0027s own capital.  Mr Trump said: The United States remains fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement, Trump said. The United States will always be a great friend of Israel and a partner in the cause of freedom and peace. Trump said that the US had “failed to acknowledge the obvious” for many years, adding that “today, we follow through on this recognition.” He also said he was “extending a hand of friendship to Israel, the Palestinians and to all of their neighbors.”  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in lockstep with Trump over fulfilling a long-standing U.S. promise to move the embassy to the holy city and over Washington\u0027s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal last week, echoed the sentiment. What a moving day for the people of Israel and the State of Israel, Netanyahu said. He paid tribute to our brave soldiers who are protecting the borders of Israel today. and said that it was a great day for peace  A peace built on lies will crash on the rocks   The capital of the Jewish people, the capital of the Jewish state.  He thanked the US President saying: President Trump by recognising history you have made history.  Ivanka Trump unveiled the US seal on the consulate in Jerusalem which has been extended to make the new embassy.   Jared Kushner, the US envoy to the Middle East , told the invited guests: When President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it, Kushner said at the embassy\u0027s opening ceremony.  Today also demonstrates American leadership. By moving our embassy to Jerusalem, we have shown the world once again that the United States can be trusted, he said. We stand with our friends and our allies, and above all else, we\u0027ve shown that the United States of America will do what\u0027s right, he said.  Despite the US President staying away, there is a massive security operation in place amid fears of a terror attack. More than 100,000 Palestinians are expected to demonstrate inside Gaza.

The 25-year-old, from Colchester, Essex, is being supported by his girlfriend, Laura Sullivan, who is now providing for both of them while he goes through treatment.  Curt\u0027s family told Essex Live he tried to claim benefits to help with their expenses, but was stunned when he was told he didn\u0027t qualify because he was out of the country for so long.  They have launched a fundraiser to help the young couple through the difficult time.  Curt\u0027s younger brother Jack, 19, said: Curt is not entitled to benefits because he was travelling outside of the country for two years even though he had paid national insurance from the age of 16 until he went travelling. He is living with his partner Laura and she is having to provide for both of them and Curt does not receive any support or benefits. The donations that we receive will go towards their general living costs and also additional treatment. Curt had worked in the UK as a vehicle technician from an apprenticeship at the age of 16 until he left the country to travel the world in 2014.  While abroad he worked with bricklayers and in demolition in Sydney, Australia, along with time working on a banana farm in Queensland. Two years later, he returned to Colchester and began working in construction and fencing. Then, in September 2017, he suffered a seizure in his sleep that would later lead towards the discovery of a brain tumour during an MRI scan in hospital. He was initially told that that the tumour was not believed to be cancerous, although several seizures followed in the months after the operation and Curt was then required to undergo open brain surgery in February of this year. Doctors attempted to remove as much of the tumour as possible, but found that the tumour was intertwined with parts of the brain and it limited how much of the tumour could be removed. Tests were done on the samples taken from the brain and it was found to be stage three cancer.

Terrifying footage shows huge flames rising high from the cars which were parked in front of their home in Sea Mills, Bristol. A dad-of-two, who asked not to be named, described how his family were woken by two loud explosions at around 2.30am on May 6. They then recorded the dramatic footage while they waited for the fire service to arrive. Looking out of their bedroom window in Bowerleaze, they realised the noise had come from their Toyota Verso and Hyundai i10 which was already engulfed in flames.  Firefighters called to the emergency confirmed the incident was likely to be arson. The family believe the apparent attack could be linked to similar incidents which have happened in the area over the last year.  The dad-of-two told Bristol Live : “We were woken by the explosions which we think were either the airbags, windows or tyres because both cars were already on fire.  “The fire was coming from the front of the car - the engine - even though they had been parked on the drive for five or six hours already.  “We rang 999 straight away and got the children out of their beds away from the front of the house and the fire engine arrived about 15 minutes later,” he said. They were told the fire was probably caused by arson and to ring the police the next day. “Something needs to happen before someone gets killed. It isn’t too much of a leap to think that the fire could’ve caught on the house and then who knows what may have happened, he added. The family suspect the cars were ignited purposely with a firework, which would match a number of recent incidents, in nearby areas. “There seems to be an epidemic,” said the dad.

Robbie Goldsmith was so lonely during his nearly 30-year career that he hurled thousands of bottles containing notes into the ocean. Using a variety of containers that floated, the 73-year-old says he would chuck as many as 12 messages into the water every week. Each one explained where the bottle had come from, and asked the finder to let Robbie know when and where it had been found. Robbie, who lives in St Peter Port on Guernsey, spent most of his working life in the Trinity House Lighthouse Service at Hanois lighthouse.  Based a mile off the channel island, his messages floated away on tidal streams to far flung destinations including Florida, US. And one of them came into the possession of a German woman. Robbie was 50 when he received a reply from the woman, called Jutta, who was living in France at the time. The pair soon became pen pals. But over the coming months, they developed a romantic connection. One woman in France found one of my letters and wrote to me, recalled Robbie, who would spend more than a month on his own at a time. I got transferred to Alderney light house and while I was there she came over and visited me. She was divorced and I was divorced so we struck up a relationship. That was good, she was from France but she was a German lady.  I was 50 at the time, she was 42 or 43. She had auburn hair and was very good looking. It was the sort of thing I would have dreamed about as a younger man. You could say that. During a break in his casual relationship with Jutta, Robbie ended up getting engaged to a former partner. He continued: Later on when I was back on land I got married to an older girlfriend so I had to break it off. But when I got divorced 10 years later she got in touch and she came over and she spent Christmas with me but the magic had gone. I was young and handsome then, I\u0027m old and ugly now. Robbie used to spend 56 days at a time living a solitary existence in his lighthouse - maintaining the lights and keeping watch for ships.  To quell his boredom, he began throwing bottles into the sea. Over his 27 years in the job, he says he hurled thousands of bottles into the water, each containing a similar, simple message. He claims he received hundreds of replies. I just thought one day let\u0027s stick a message in a bottle and see what happens, he said. After a month I got one reply, and I thought this is a good idea. It was a good way to contact people, being on a lighthouse is quite lonely. I used to put 10 or 12 in a week, I would use any sort of bottle, plastic, glass, mustard jars, and marble tin containers, anything that floated. I’d probably get prosecuted now. The note I had written in it was quite simple.  The message read, \u0027this bottle was thrown into sea from the Hanois lighthouse, which is one mile of the south-west coast of Guernsey, if you find it please let me know when and where you found it\u0027. Although Robbie has fond memories of his time in the lighthouse service, he also experienced tragedy when his teenage son drowned. The then-lighthouse keeper was on Guernsey when the 19-year-old fisherman, Paul, got into trouble in nearby waters while alone. He drowned right by the lighthouse, said Robbie. I was ashore at the time when it happened, he was only 19. He was a fisherman and was in his boat and it sank. We don\u0027t know what happened, he was on his own so we don\u0027t know for sure. Although Robbie left the lighthouse service around 20 years ago, some of his messages are still being found.

Speculation is rife about how she\u0027ll be prepping for the big day - from her hair and dress choice, to her diet and exercise regime. She\u0027s been refreshingly honest about her love for fitness in the past, and it\u0027s no surprise - with a yoga instructor for a mother and gym-obsessed pals like Millie Mackintosh. Meghan\u0027s enviable body clearly isn\u0027t just down to good genetics. But there\u0027s one tough workout that the future royal absolutely swears by when it comes to shredding fat and staying lean. Apparently she\u0027s a massive fan of the Megaformer, an intense full-body fitness class that takes place on a souped-up Reformer Pilates machine. She\u0027s been quoted praising Megaformer workouts as hands down the best thing you could do for your body, and is rumoured to be a big fan of Studio Lagree, the LA-fitness export that\u0027s fast catching on over here in the UK. Kim Kardashian and Chrissy Teigen are also said to be fans of the Lagree fitness method, which utilises the Megaformer machine and now has four studios in London. So how hard actually is it? I went and tried the class for myself at the studio\u0027s newest outpost in London\u0027s Nobu Hotel.  Here\u0027s what happened... The Megaformer machines are pretty complicated. As I enter the room, I\u0027m greeted by rows and rows of machines that look not too dissimilar to dark, leathery torture devices. If you\u0027ve ever tried Reformer Pilates, you\u0027d be forgiven for thinking the two workouts might be similar - both machines have a central carriage that slides back and forth, attached to a row of springs for resistance. But get closer and you\u0027ll realise there are plenty more bells and whistles to play with on the Megaformer - from cutouts and handles to feet and arm straps. These are designed to bring you to a higher threshold of intensity, testing your core, endurance, cardio, balance, strength and flexibility all at once. Navigating the precarious padded table (which moves with you) in the first 10 minutes of the class can be quite daunting, but the instructors are always on-hand to correct your form. Unlike Reformers, the machines also have handy position markings so you can make sure you\u0027re lined up correctly. It might just be the hardest workout you\u0027ll ever do. Don\u0027t be fooled by the cute names for the movements, like bear, mermaid and catfish.  One of the most surprising things about the Megaformer workout is just how ab-crushingly difficult it is, and I feel personally betrayed when a move called sexy back reduces me to a hideously unattractive, sweaty mess. I make the mistake of trying to rush through the movements, and my instructor Matt McEgmont soon pulls me up on my pace. In Megaformer, it\u0027s all about excruciatingly slow movements - the slower you go, the better results you see, and there\u0027s very little rest between each position. One of the most challenging movements involves pushing the table backwards and forwards with my forearms, while holding a plank position. My abs are completely on fire and I look like a flailing fish. The carriage is spring-loaded with resistance that ranges from 0 to about 115 kg, so you can make controlling the table with your legs and arms as challenging as you like. Because you always have some part of your body on the carriage (which is on wheels and in motion), you\u0027re also constantly challenging your core to keep you balanced.  Within 10 minutes my legs and arms are uncontrollably shaking from the resistance load and I\u0027m wondering if I\u0027ll actually have to give up part way through. People often describe Megaformer with words like humbling and crushing, and McEgmont assures my that the shaking is totally normal - apparently the workout has reduced everyone from bodybuilders and professional athletes to quaking messes. But it\u0027s OK to feel like you\u0027re terrible at it. According to McEgmont, failure is good. The Lagree Method is focused on working the muscles to failure, he tells me. That\u0027s right, to get the most of the workout you actually want to feel like you\u0027re ready to give up. The method integrates the key elements of resistance and counter-resistance in a sequence that allows for zero-gravity at peak muscle contraction, encouraging maximum exertion while allowing for a low risk of injury.

Chefs and their assistants in the Windsor Castle kitchens will start washing and peeling vegetables in the next few days to make sure everything is perfect for the bride and groom. They are due to tie the knot in Windsor on Saturday, and hundreds have been speculating about what the royal couple might feed their 600 guests. Led by the Queen’s chef Mark Flanagan, the team have sourced fresh ingredients from the Home Counties and lands associated with the Queen like Windsor. Mr Flanagan said: The day of the wedding has fallen very kindly for us. “All the British vegetables are just coming into season... and that\u0027s been a point of focus for us.  We know the couple wanted us to make sure we used all of the local seasonal produce as much as possible throughout their menu, and this recent good weather is really helping us to achieve that. (For) all their decisions, we purely made suggestions and the couple... they\u0027ve tasted everything, they\u0027ve been involved in every detail... “We are using produce off Her Majesty\u0027s estates and that features very much. The sweet and savoury canapes are made to be consumed in two bites, while the bowl dishes can be eaten standing up.  Produce like asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season. The wedding dinner is being staged at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales, with different caterers responsible for that event for 200 guests. The food is likely to be washed down with champagne and wine from the extensive royal cellars and soft drinks. The head chef would not discuss the dishes in detail but produce like asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season - providing a wealth of options for the culinary expert who has worked for some of the world\u0027s best chefs, like Michel and Albert Roux and Raymond Blanc.

When she stepped out the carriage and walked up St Paul\u0027s Cathedral\u0027s stairs with the huge train behind her, the world was in awe of its beauty. But there was one person who wasn’t happy when she first saw the dress - the woman who designed and made it. Elizabeth Emanuel and her husband spent months creating the stunning ivory silk taffeta and antique lace gown. The dress reportedly cost \u0026pound9,000 at the time, and featured puffed sleeves and more then 10,000 pearls.  Speaking during ITV\u0027s Invitation to the Royal Wedding, Elizabeth admitted being horrified when she saw how creased Diana\u0027s dress had become. She said: We did know it would crease a bit but when I saw her arrive at St Paul\u0027s and we saw the creasing I actually felt faint. I was horrified, really, because it was quite a lot of creasing.  It was a lot more than we thought. They had done a dress rehearsal but using a different material, and it wasn\u0027t anywhere near as bad. But she now says that looking back, that moment was actually her favourite shot of the Princess in the dress, comparing it to a caterpillar coming out of a cocoon and becoming a butterfly.

And now, a secret shopper has found out just how much cheaper Aldi is than its supermarket rivals - from Asda and Tesco to Waitrose. The discount store swept the board in the High Street supermarket price survey this week, based on a trolley of 33 \u0027everyday\u0027 items. Its shopping basket was more than \u0026pound4 cheaper than its nearest rival in the survey - Asda - according to a report published yesterday. The price difference highlights a reason behind the proposed merger between Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s, which was announced last month.  The stores have come under growing pressure from many Brits switching to discounters like Aldi and Lidl to save money on their weekly shop. Trade magazine The Grocer carries out a weekly mystery shopping basket survey checking the prices of 33 \u0027everyday\u0027 items at the five major supermarket chains - but this week added Aldi as a guest retailer. It found that while Aldi shoppers paid \u0026pound33.14 for their basket of goods, customers at nearest rival Asda paid \u0026pound4.41 more, at \u0026pound37.55. Sainsbury\u0027s was ranked next at \u0026pound39.51 - which was \u0026pound6.37 more expensive than Aldi - followed by Tesco, Morrisons and Waitrose.  The Grocer said: Guest retailer Aldi claimed a convincing win over its traditional supermarket rivals this week - and in doing so illustrated one of the key reasons why Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s feel the need to merge. Aldi\u0027s \u0026pound33.14 total was \u0026pound4.41 cheaper than Asda, helped by offering the lowest price for 27 of the 33 items on our list. Twenty three of these were exclusively cheaper than any of its rivals. This makes Asda 13.3 per cent more expensive and while the gap has closed from 16.5 per cent in January, drastic measures appear to be needed if Asda is to genuinely close the price gap to the discounters.  It added: Hence the Sainsbury\u0027s merger - should a post-deal Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s live up to their promise to cut many everyday prices by 10 per cent, Asda in particular would start to look a lot more competitive. Sainsbury\u0027s, which last week also invested \u0026pound35 million in reducing the price of selected meat and fish products, actually managed to grab third spot this week. Although at \u0026pound39.51 it was \u0026pound6.37 and 19.2 per cent more expensive than Aldi. Tesco was 21.5 per cent more expensive than Aldi at \u0026pound40.70, a difference of \u0026pound7.56. As our shopping list was heavily weighted towards own label, Tesco\u0027s Brand Guarantee scheme had little impact on the final standings. Our shopper had 45p taken off her bill at the checkout which still left it \u0026pound7.11 more expensive than Aldi.  Morrisons was over 25 per cent more expensive than Aldi at \u0026pound41.68. In the case of sixth-placed Waitrose the difference was even greater - the \u0026pound14.86 difference on its \u0026pound48 basket makes it 44.8 per cent more expensive. Waitrose also had just two products on deal. This compared with Asda\u0027s nine, Aldi\u0027s eight, Morrisons\u0027 six and four each at Sainsbury\u0027s and Tesco.

People across the UK will be digging out their flip flops, sunglasses and shorts again as they enjoy a glorious burst of warmth and sun after the weekend washout. Forecasters say summer-like conditions are expected to make a comeback over the next couple of days, banishing the cool and unsettled westerly airflow that kept the mercury subdued over the weekend. They predict the best of the warm weather will be in the south-east, where locals and tourists in the capital could bask in 22C heat. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE THE FORECAST FOR YOUR AREA       In comparison, 20C highs are expected on the holiday hotspot Ibiza - while 17C temperatures and showers are predicted in the Italian capital. Figures will linger around the high teens and low 20s for the rest of the UK. Today, temperatures will rise sharply, reaching highs of 19C widely - even in parts of Scotland - as high pressure lures a welcome brief burst of warmth and sunshine from south-west Europe, according to forecasters. Values are expected to continue to rise into tomorrow, with temperatures predicted to soar up to 4-8C above average for the time of year. Eleanor Bell, principal meteorologist of The Weather Channel , said almost all of the country will enjoy drier, brighter and warmer climates today.  However, a north-south weather divide will mean clearer skies and sunny spells will be replaced by scattered showers in Scotland and north-west England by tomorrow afternoon. She added: High pressure is expected to build early next week with warmer air from the south- west mixing in. This along with increasing sunshine will allow temperatures to lift above normal. Maximum temperatures will be around 16-18C on Monday, lifting to 18-22C on Tuesday. But it will be cooler over the north-west, 13-17C, with more in the way of cloud and showers there. According to the Met Office, parts of the south-east could see 23C highs tomorrow, with the best temperatures likely around Southampton.  And looking ahead to the weekend, it is thought Prince Harry, 33, and actress Meghan Markle, 36, will also enjoy sunshine as they tie the knot. Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: “The week ahead will see a lot of fine weather from Monday, and that is likely to continue for the royal wedding. “Early indications are for Saturday in Windsor to be dry and bright with highs around 18C, a touch above the 17C average. “This Tuesday could see 25C in the South, before highs return to normal on Wednesday and then edge upwards again on Saturday.” Below, you can find out the forecast for your area for today and tomorrow. North East England Although this morning may have been chilly, most people in the North East are set to enjoy warm weather by this afternoon. The sunshine will be largely unbroken and the conditions will be dry, with maximum temperatures of around 18C.  But the Met Office warns: Some mist may encroach onto coasts later in the day, together with cooling coastal breezes. Tomorrow, it will be warm inland with long sunny periods, but coastal areas could see cooler conditions with fog patches. Some places are set to enjoy 19C highs. North West England This region will see plenty of warm sunshine throughout today, with a light wind and largely cloud-free skies, the Met Office says. Temperatures of up to 20C are expected. Tomorrow morning will also see warm sunshine, but cloud and a few spots of rain could arrive for some later in the day. Again, the area could enjoy highs of 20C.  West Midlands Those in the West Midlands can expect glorious weather today - with sunshine, warm temperatures and barely a cloud in the sky. The Met Office says: After a chilly start to the day, plenty of warm sunshine will develop. The wind will be light and there will barely be a cloud in the sky into the afternoon and evening. Temperatures could hit 21C - and tomorrow is set to be even warmer. The weather service adds: Tuesday will start cold, however there will be some unbroken warm sunshine through the day. For some cloud will build into the afternoon but it will stay dry. Maximum temperature 22 \u0026degC. Yorkshire and Humber Like other areas, Yorkshire and Humber will have seen a rather chilly start. But this afternoon, it will be warm in most areas with dry conditions and largely unbroken sunshine, forecasters say.   The region could see highs of 20C, but some mist and cooling coastal breezes could encroach onto coasts later today. Tomorrow is also expected to be warm and sunny, with temperatures as high as 21C. However, there could be light winds. East Midlands The forecast here is similar to that of Yorkshire and Humber - it will be warm for many inland areas with largely unbroken sunshine. Conditions are also expected to be dry, forecasters say. Temperatures could reach 20C - potentially soaring to 22C by tomorrow. The Met Office says it will also be warm inland tomorrow, but low cloud, fog patches and cooler conditions may occasionally affect coasts. It adds: Then cloudier overnight with patchy rain, and becoming breezy.  Wales People in Wales can expect to enjoy plenty of warm sunshine today, with temperatures as high as 20C. The wind will be light, but we could see some patches of low cloud in the far west, the Met Office predicts. It adds that there will also be warm sunshine tomorrow, with largely cloud-free skies - although the coast will be cooler. Temperatures of up to 21C are expected. London and South East England Western areas are set to enjoy warm, sunny weather today - as temperatures soar to 21C (and a staggering 23C by tomorrow). The Met Office says: Becoming warm for western areas by the afternoon, often sunny, and most places dry, but perhaps cloudier here later.   Generally cloudy in eastern counties, with cooling breezes across Kent coasts and hills, and a few spots of drizzle possible. It adds that, tomorrow, most areas will be warm and sunny by the afternoon, with the best temperatures likely around Southampton. South West England Again, despite a chilly start, this region will see plenty of warm sunshine today. However, the Met Office warns it will be cooler in the far west. Highs of 19C are expected. Tomorrow is also set to be warm and sunny, with largely cloud-free skies. But areas on the coast could see cloud and cooler conditions. Temperatures could soar to 20C, forecasters predict.  East England It will be warm, sunny and mostly dry in the west today, forecasters say. However, the conditions in eastern counties will be generally cloudy with cooling breezes, coastal mist, fog and a few spots of drizzle. The region will see maximum temperatures of around 19C. Tomorrow, low cloud, fog patches and cooler conditions will become confined to coasts, according to the Met Office. Many inland areas will be warm and sunny by the afternoon. Temperatures could hit 20C. Northern Ireland After a cloudy morning, Northern Ireland is expected to see a little afternoon sunshine, with warmer weather and light winds. The area could see highs of 18C today. Tomorrow, it is set to be a dry start with bright spells in the east. The afternoon will be dry and bright in some places, forecasters say. Unlike other areas, a lower high has been predicted for tomorrow - 17C. Scotland Most parts will experience a dry, sunny and warm day, forecasters say. Those in Edinburgh can expect to see plenty of sunshine - with temperatures set to soar to as high as 19C. Tomorrow is also expected to start off dry and sunny, although some areas of the country could see cloudy, damp weather throughout the day.

It is a big concern for parents as car seats are often fitted behind the driver. The Volkswagen Group, which owns both brands, has confirmed the issue in its own tests. The cars that are affected are the new 2018 Polo, on sale since January and the Seat Arona and Seat Ibiza - although the exact Seat models are yet to be confirmed.

While it sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, for one mum the dilemma is all too real and unpleasant.  Having helped her mother-in-law with several aspects of her wedding - and kept costs down in the process - the mum has now found herself snubbed from the nuptials.  Even more gallingly, her husband and young daughters are all part of the wedding party.  Erm, what?    My mother-in-law and I have historically had a slightly tense relationship, she explains on Mumsnet .  However, she adds how things have, over time, got a lot better between her and her mother-in-law and they now have a generally good relationship.  She goes on to explain that while geography means she\u0027s not able to offer practical help with her grandkids, she is a lovely, thoughtful, interested granny, which I am grateful for. The mum even adds that it\u0027s her who keeps in touch with her mother-in-law, as her husband is busy and a man of few words. So, nothing so far to cause any alarm bells to ring. Now. My mother-in-law is engaged. Planning wedding. Is not very well off, thus wants me to buy dresses so my two daughters can be bridesmaids.  I have offered to make some decorations etc to keep cost down. And needs my husband kitted up so he can give her away. Also fine. And needs us all to fly over and find accommodation and hire car. We are a bit tight financially too, which my mother-in-law is aware of, but this is a special occasion, so no problem, we\u0027ll find the money. Again, so far, so good. Everyone is playing nicely - especially the daughter-in-law, who sounds like a wedding-planning angel - and there\u0027s no reason to think anyone harbours anyone else any ill will. At least, until the mother-in-law dropped a bombshell.  The mum continues: [She] has decided to hold ceremony in very small place that can only accommodate the wedding party. I.e. she wants me to have invested quite a bit of time, effort and money into her wedding but I have to wait at pub while my husband and daughters, sister-in-law, brother-in-law and nieces etc attend it and then just go to reception.

But how do you celebrate the exciting occasion if you\u0027re a budding baker? By making a life-size cake of the happy couple - obviously. Lara Mason spent 250 hours making the incredible cake, and the final result is extremely realistic. It could feed 500 people and was made using 300 eggs, 15kg of flour, 15kg of butter and 15kg of sugar.  To decorate and to hold the whole thing together, she needed more than 10kg of buttercream, 20kg of modelling chocolate and 50kg of fondant icing. Speaking to , Lara said: It really has been a labour of love but I\u0027m so please and so proud of myself It\u0027s the tallest cake I\u0027ve ever made. Annoyingly, Prince Harry is 6ft 2 so it had to be 6ft 2. But you don\u0027t know until you try. Every time I test myself and push my boundaries I learn something new.  We think the cake looks incredible, but the biggest test was when she showed it off to her one-year-old twin daughters Lily and Lyla. She said: Lyla reached her arms out to try and give him a hug, so she must have thought he was a real person. That was the final nod because she wasn\u0027t scared of him. Lara made the cake at her West Midlands home around working a full time job and looking after her daughters.  She said: It was just trying to find ten minutes here and there. Lara says the hardest part was sculpting Harry and Meghan\u0027s faces from modelling chocolate. She made the cake for the Cake International event, which will be held in Birmingham in November, so her incredible design will be doing into storage for the next few months. A spokesman for Cake International said: The cake was designed to stretch the designer\u0027s boundaries in the art of cake decorating and never intended to be eaten, but enjoyed by thousands as an inspirational feature at Cake International at the NEC in November. It\u0027s also been designed to catch the eye, which it certainly has done so for the artist the cost, ingredients and most importantly the design challenge have been well rewarded.  Lara shared the photos on the parenting website The Motherload and she\u0027s been inundated with comments praising her work.  This isn\u0027t the first time Lara has impressed us all with her incredible cake making skills.  In February she made life-size models of her twin daughters Lily and Lyla for their first birthday party. Speaking at the time, she said: I totally get this won\u0027t be everyone\u0027s cup of tea, but not a lot of other people do this crazy thing that I do so I thought to myself… Why not?! I mean, what other kids get to say that their mum made them life-size cakes of themselves for their 1st birthday!? I\u0027ll be cleaning buttercream out of the floorboards for months but I reckon it was 100 per cent worth it.  The cakes babies are both wearing first birthday t-shirts and pink tutus to match the real Lily and Lyla for the unique photoshoot. Unsurprisingly the ingredients list for the two cakes is rather long. To make them she used, 44 eggs, 2.2kg flour, 5kg of chocolate, 3kg of fondant icing, 4kg of buttercream and a lot of butter. Lara said: The cakes have taken a fair few hours, I’d say about 100 to 120 hours over the last few weeks.  Most of that time goes into the decorative icing pieces, so the cakes themselves I\u0027ve been rushing to get done over the last week. They are made up of 22 6inch round Madeira cakes and the hair is made out of pulled sugar so I had to make every individual strand separately, I\u0027d say that was the hardest part.

A 60 Minutes investigation by Nine News in Australia that aired tonight features a panel of aviation experts working to determine what brought the plane down. Since March 2014 the world has questioned how a Boeing 777 carrying 239 people vanished into thin air en route from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur. Most of the wreckage has never been found but now but now experts say they finally have the answers. Larry Vance, former senior investigator with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told the Australian current affairs programme he was confident he knows what happened to the aircraft.  “I think the general public can take comfort in the fact that there is a growing consensus on the plane’s final moments,” he said. The panel believe that the man in the cockpit, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was responsible. They all agree the pilot “was killing himself” and took the plane to the most remote spot he could so it would “disappear”.  Boeing 777 pilot and instructor Simon Hardy said Captain Zaharie avoided detection of the plane by either Malaysian or Thai military radar by flying along the border, crossing in and out of each nation\u0027s airspace. Mr Hard told the programme: “As the aircraft went across Thailand and Malaysia, it runs down the border, which is wiggling underneath, meaning it\u0027s going in and out of those two countries, which is where their jurisdictions are.  “So both of the controllers aren\u0027t bothered about this mysterious aircraft. Cause it\u0027s, \u0027Oh, it\u0027s gone. It\u0027s not in our space anymore\u0027. “If you were commissioning me to do this operation and try and make a 777 disappear, I would do exactly the same thing. “As far as I\u0027m concerned, it\u0027s very accurate flying because think it did the job and we know, as a fact, that the military did not come and intercept the aircraft.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hero pilot lands plane after","story":"NewsHero pilot lands plane after cockpit window suddenly SHATTERS at terrifying 32,000ftThe Chinese passenger plane had to make a dramatic emergency landing after the windscreen broke off and the aircraft dropped in altitude\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAbigail O\u0027Leary14:46, 14 MAY 2018Updated18:10, 14 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hero pilot landed a plane after the cockpit window shattered at a terrifying 32,000ft.

Shocking CCTV footage captured the incident at Istanbul Ataturk Airport, an international hub visited by thousands of British holidaymakers. Footage shows how the Turkish Airlines flight was parked at the gate when it was hit by another plane. The Asiana plane had just started to taxi before take off when it sliced through the tail fin of the parked jet. The wing of the Asiana Airbus A330 can be seen hitting the Turkish Airlines Airbus A321 vertical fin, knocking it clean off.  No passengers are believed to have been injured in the crash but both planes were left requiring extensive repairs. The Asiana Airbus A330, which was flying to the South Korean capital of Seoul when the crash happened, is thought to have been grounded in Istanbul. It is believed the passengers were then put on a different plane to complete their journey.  British tourists Kaarina Barron and her friend Clare Chambers were seated near the back of the stationary Turkish Airline plane when its tail fin was sliced off, reports the Mail Online .

they try to save their season at Livingston on Friday.Skipper Willo Flood is definitely out because of the red card he received as the Tangerines went down to Livi at Tannadice on Monday.And key man Bilel Mohsni also looks set to miss out because of the groin injury he picked up right at the end of that morale-sapping 3-2 play off defeat.Immediately after the final whistle gaffer Csaba Laszlo expressed his concern the nature of Mohsni’s injury meant the centre-half would not make the four-day turnaround between games.Two days on the Tunisian international is still struggling to recover.Given his influence on the defence since he arrived March, his absence would be a major setback.“I don’t think in this short time he will be recovered but we are a team and we have to show also that we can stand up,” said Csaba.Mark Durnan is a ready-made replacement for the 30-year-old but problems with an ankle injury mean he hasn’t started a game since the win over champions St Mirren a month ago.Meanwhile, the first of Flood’s two bookings on Monday means he will miss the start of next season under the totting up process.Although United have already lost twice a Livingston this season, the manager still believes they can overcome the 3-2 deficit from the first leg.“It is only one goal and we can win,” added Csaba.“If a chance comes we must take it, this is

that two motorhomes and three caravans had parked at Kingsway West Retail Park.The Travellers set up camp immediately outside Toys ‘R’ Us, which closed on April 24 after the company went into administration.Three of the caravans are parked on disabled parking spaces which are still in operation and fixtures such as barbecues have been erected by the occupants.Site managers working on behalf of the retail park confirmed to the Tele that they were taking the “necessary legal actions” to move the Travellers off the site.A spokesman said: “Both the owner and management team are aware of the occupiers in situ outside the store.“They do not have permission to be on site and as such have been served notice that they must leave the land immediately.“The necessary legal actions are being taken to remove them from the retail park.”Both Dundee City Council and Police Scotland confirmed they were aware of the Travellers’ arrival at the retail park, just yards away from other stores which are continuing to operate.When the Tele approached those living on the site, a man with an Irish accent swore through a crack in his window and said: “Mind your own business.”Only one resident opened their door but closed it immediately after being shown press ID.While the Toys ‘R’ Us store is shut, the unit in which the store operated and the land outside it is owned by fund management firm ARES and operated by the property firm GVA.The site is not licensed for the purposes of camping — meaning those who set up caravans there are doing so illegally.The council operates a licensed site for Travellers just outside Dundee at Balmuir Wood, Tealing.Twenty pitches are available at Balmuir Wood for Travelling communities, each of which features electricity supplies, utility rooms with showers and toilets and 24-hour access.According to housing charity Shelter Scotland, Travellers staying on private sites can be evicted “fairly easily” by landowners if they do not have permission to be there.The charity said: “If you park up on private land without consent, the owner or legal occupier (for example, a tenant) can take steps to evict you.“If the landowner or occupier does decide to evict you, they may apply to the court for an interdict or possession order requiring you to move off the land, ask the council to take action, ask the police to take action or move you

There’s a few dodgy ones with the ball bouncing around and maybe a suggestion of a penalty but I felt we were well worth our three points.”County were furious at referee Andrew Dallas’ decision to book Michael Gardyne for diving with five minutes to go.Co-manager Stuart Kettlewell said: “I know there is human error in football but at the end of the day these decisions are massive.“But if you get a penalty at that stage of the game who knows what happens, you have an opportunity to get level and build momentum to win the game.“We would love to know who is accountable because we just get fobbed off all the time.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county wide man michael gardyne on dundee and uniteds radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWIth survival assured on Tuesday night, Dundee boss Neil McCann’s “recruitment drive” for next season is up and running.And one possible arrival could be Ross County playmaker Michael Gardyne – though, the Dark Blues may well have competition from across the city on their hands.The Dundonian is out of contract at the end of this season and, with his roots down here, a move back might be on the cards.His history with Dundee United – where he played 37 times in season 2012/13 – however, makes Tannadice a more likely destination for the 32-year-old.That’s likely to be dependent on whether Csaba Laszlo’s men can win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs.The Dark Blues won’t comment on any possible signings but gaffer Neil has been able to get working on improving his squad for next season after the 1-0 win at Ross County saw them guaranteed a ninth-place finish.He said: “The plans we’ve been looking at over the past five or six months in terms of recruitment we can actually start to push forward with now and start a bit of a recruitment drive.“I don’t think you can ever push on it 100% until you know you’re going to be safe.“Tuesday’s win allows us to start forward thinking but there’s still business to be done.“I’m not going to disrespect Ross County by going into Saturday (against Partick) and taking the foot off the gas and go through the motions, because we have to be professional.”Partick sit two points ahead of the Staggies in 11th spot and still with the possibility of catching Hamilton and jumping to safety. That’ll take a swing of 13 goals, however.With Thistle at risk of automatic relegation if they are beaten by the Dark Blues on Saturday, Neil knows his side will have to be on their game if they are to finish the season off on a high at Dens Park.He added: “We have to look to win it and, if we do our business right, we can hold our heads high.“We want to win at home. We’ve got back-to-back wins in the split and we’re looking for three.“I charged the boys with the task of getting five wins from five games – we’ve had three out of four and we’ll look to go into Partick and make it four out of five.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/bowman-390x575.jpg ","title":"tannadice game chance for arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBids are now being taken for fans wanting the chance to play at Tannadice in Dundee United legend Dave Bowman’s ninth annual charity match to raise funds for skin cancer and dementia charities.The game between fans making successful bids and a team of past tangerine greats takes place on Friday week with a 6.30pm kick-off.This year the fans’ team will be turning out in a special kit in honour of United’s roots as Dundee Hibernian.“This is now the ninth year of these games taking place and there is no doubt I am getting slower,” said Bowman.“The old fire is still burning so nobody better try to beat me on the park.“Seriously, this is always a great evening and a lot of fun and every year it makes me happy that players from all ability levels take part in the game.“It is all about enjoying the game.

The details were aired at a meeting with ward councillors.Inverness West SNP councillor Bill Boyd, Ballifeary Community Council chairwoman Zosia Fraser and Murdo Campbell, who owns Loanfern Guest House in Glenurquhart Road, consider the response inadequate.The agency was praised by Cllr Boyd and ward colleague Graham Ross for listening and a public consultation will follow in the next few months.But Mrs Fraser said: \u0026ldquoFrankly, are we waiting for someone to be killed or seriously injured on Glenurqhart Road?\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove seen kids trying to get across the road to the Co-op, to stock up for the day, and they\u0026rsquore taking their life in their hands to get across that road. It\u0027 a great worry. I don\u0026rsquot know how mums with small children cope with the traffic.Mr Campbell said: \u0026ldquoA cont-rolled crossing is the only way to improve safety. Glenurquhart Road is busy with very dangerous crossroads.\u0026ldquoThe new (West Link) bridge has taken a lot of traffic off the road but that\u0027 made it faster because the traffic now moves more freely. There\u0027 a greater risk of accidents.Agency representatives acknowledged that there had been one fatal accident involving a pedestrian and 14 other collisions \u0026ndash three of them \u0026ldquoserious \u0026ndash involving pedestrians or cyclists along the city stretch of A82 between 2013 and 2017.The proposed upgrades would be in Longman Road, Kenneth Street, the Tomnahurich Street-Planefield Road junction, the Glenurquhart Road-Park Ro-ad-Bishops Road junction, and at the West Link roundabout.The agency envisages \u0026ldquowidened pavements and islands to shorten the crossing distance at various locations, additional pedestrian crossing facilities at the A82 Kenneth Street-Tomnahurich Street junction signals and a shared footway and cycleway facility between Longman and Telford roundabouts.A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll present draft options to the public at an information day where we\u0026rsquoll seek their feedback.Cllr Boyd said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll keep the pressure on.Monday 14 May 2018 8:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04003000/04003573.jpg","title":"Help offered to Highland Council is the business","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspInverness Chamber of Commerce has offered to host a summit on the key issues.The invitation follows a rallying call for the public to \u0026ldquohelp themselves by lobbying MPs and MSPs on the council\u0027 behalf, to highlight the need for extra revenue to protect and strengthen services.The independent-led minority administration also urged anyone with novel ideas for boosting the local authority\u0027 finances to make contact.The Scottish Government disputes it, but council convener Bill Lobban insists that council funding has been \u0026ldquocut, in real terms, by 9.6 percent since 2010.Administration leaders are preparing a document for Scottish Government ministers explaining why Highland is a \u0026ldquospecial case due to its vast geography.The council has been proactive in reviewing its entire work practices through a cross-party \u0026ldquoredesign board with a mission to be more business-like.

Clearly the show is very much about farming and we still have all the different classes and it\u0027 very much a competition for the farming fraternity.\u0026ldquoHowever, to make the event sustainable we have had to diversify and introduce new attractions \u0026ndash often still with a farming theme, but that appeal to those who have little or no farming background at all.Music will also play a big part in this year\u0027 event with live music to suit all tastes all day in the bar marquee.Monster trucks Big Pete and the Grim Reaper will take to the main arena to wow the crowds.

Mr Hendry branded it the \u0026ldquoworst kind of postcode lottery and asked the Department of Work and Pensions minister to make urgent changes.And he also called on the minister to follow the Scottish government\u0027 lead and remove the legal definition of terminal illness, currently set at six months by the UK government.\u0026ldquoUnder existing UK government rules, people with conditions such as terminal heart failure, motor neurone disease and other terminal conditions need to apply for social security in the usual way and are subject to the normal assessments, including work assessments.\u0026ldquoThey are quite simply not considered terminal enough \u0026ndash this policy exposes a Tory government at its very worst and they are wilfully failing families dealing with the trauma of terminal illness.\u0026ldquoPeople who are dying should not be forced to go to appointments with work coaches, nor should they have to spend their last month\u0027 fighting for much needed financial support.\u0026ldquoEven those who fall under the UK government\u0027 \u0026lsquosix months to live\u0026rsquo definition are subjected to heart-breaking waits for their financial support.Monday 14 May 2018 8:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"}]
