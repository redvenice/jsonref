Photos of the garment would appear to confirm Lund\u0027s story, as the bustier worn by Abdul looks identical to the one created by Lund           Lund (pictured with Cindy Crawford in April) says the garment is one of a kind and could not be replicated without the use of master beaders and weavers, and requires a process that takes at least five days to complete          Lund, a childhood best friend of Kim Kardashian (pictured together in their early teens), made the bustier eight years agoBut after getting no response from the singer, 56, Lund says she now has no choice but to sue the \u002780s icon for the return of her item.\u0027I don\u0027t know how she came to have it, I\u0027m not saying she stole it or her stylist stole it or anything,\u0027 Lund said in an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV.\u0027I would just like to get it back – it\u0027s obviously my piece.\u0027Abdul\u0027s representative declined to comment on the bustier when approached by DailyMailTV, except to note that the publicity photo was taken two years ago.Lund\u0027s lawyer Stephanie Ovadia told DailyMailTV: \u0027I was retained to see the return of the property after she attempted to contact Paula to no avail.\u0027We are currently in the process of contacting Ms Abdul for the swift return of the property.\u0027Lund, a childhood best friend of Kim Kardashian, made the bustier eight years ago and says creating it took her five days.She told DailyMailTV the piece has sentimental value because her grandmother helped her to create it.\u0027My grandmother helped me make it,\u0027 Lund said. \u0027She sat with me for a few hours and I had a deadline to get it done and she actually weaved some pieces on for me to help me. It\u0027s a very important piece to me.\u0027          The design, which was created from a mixture of silver metallic thread and chiffon, was hand-sewn and was later worn by celebrities, among them Gwen Stefani, Britney Spears and singer Roselyn Sanchez (pictured)           But after getting no response from the singer, 56, Lund says she now has no choice but to sue the 80s icon for the return of her item          Lund (pictured with Kim Kardashian in their younger years) said: \u0027I don\u0027t know why it would be so hard for them to give it back to the rightful owner. It is important to me. I just want it back\u0027The design, which was created from a mixture of silver metallic thread and chiffon, was hand-sewn and was later worn by celebrities, among them Gwen Stefani and Britney Spears.Lund says the garment is one of a kind and could not be replicated without the use of master beaders and weavers, and requires a process that takes at least five days to complete.She says the garment disappeared from her showroom four years ago and assumed it had been taken by accident which is why she never reported the missing item to police.Lund said: \u0027I didn\u0027t report it to the police and the reason why we didn\u0027t is because I figured at the time, it would have been returned, it would have come back.\u0027To be honest, what are the police going to do with a bustier gone missing? They don\u0027t take something like that as seriously.\u0027I figured that through friends and through time, I would eventually get the bustier back. I always honestly thought I would get the bustier back.\u0027\u0027Every moment of life should be savored\u0027: Paula Abdul shares...Kaia Gerber steals the Versace show in flamboyant suit as...Share this article    Lund says she does not want to make an enemy of Abdul but is now hoping to have the piece returned without further problems But despite her hopes, the garment was not seen again until the release of Abdul\u0027s publicity photos, which Lund saw for the first time over the weekend.\u0027I couldn\u0027t believe it,\u0027 she told DailyMailTV. \u0027I felt two things – I felt elated and I felt excited I could possibly get my piece back again.\u0027But I also felt a little angry because it reminded me that somebody had obtained that piece dishonestly and that doesn\u0027t mean that Paula Abdul did, it doesn\u0027t mean that her stylist did, it means that somebody took that piece and it ended up in her hands and I just hope she does the right thing and gets it back to me.\u0027 Lund says she does not want to make an enemy of Abdul but is now hoping to have the piece returned without further problems.

Anthony Bourdain\u0027s grief-stricken partner accuses Dove of trying to smear Bourdain as dying with a prostitute and overdosing on heroin. In fact he hanged himself alone          Her side: Asia Argento said that although Bennett (pictured as a young boy in 2004) assaulted her, she \u0027felt sorry for the child I had met, that I cared so much about,\u0027 because he \u0027needed money\u0027          Argento\u0027s first contact with McGowan was a pivotal moment in her life. She explained, \u0027She was the first person, another Weinstein victim, I was talking to\u0027The women\u0027s friendship was forged through their shared trauma and their united goal to use it to bring about a cultural change.To Argento, McGowan was \u0027a sister.\u0027 They even got matching tattoos -a simple dot on Argento\u0027s ankle that is a marked contrast to the intricate ink of Argento\u0027s many other tattoos. (She now plans to have it erased).And when the unthinkable happened and Argento received the devastating news that Bourdain, her lover and confidante of two years, had taken his own life in a French hotel room McGowan\u0027s phone call was one of the very few she answered.She recalled, \u0027Rose said she was in Europe that she would come and see me.\u0027What I didn\u0027t know is that she... told, this notion that she was coming to \u0027\u0027my rescue\u0027\u0027 in an interview.\u0027Today, she said, she views McGowan\u0027s actions as nothing but a \u0027publicity stunt.\u0027                             I thought, \u0027My sister is coming here, to see me, to lift me.\u0027 I thought it was incredibly kind of her to come and help me                        She said, \u0027I was completely numb, paralyzed, obviously I wasn\u0027t reading. I didn\u0027t even want to read the details of Anthony\u0027s death. I was frightened to know.\u0027I found out later that she had given this information to the news so already it was like a publicity stunt but I didn\u0027t see it.\u0027I thought, My sister is coming here, to see me, to lift me. I thought it was incredibly kind of her to come and help me.\u0027The day after Bourdain died Argento went back to work on Italian X-Factor on which she was a judge. She had a choice, she said, - work or never get up again. Today she credits that work with saving her life.She has been forced to step down from the role in the wake of the Bennett allegations.Looking back to the days directly after Bourdain\u0027s death, Argento reflected, \u0027At this time I was so lost in my mind.\u0027According to Argento it was a bizarre interlude during which she traveled to Berlin to meet Rose and her partner Dove, whom she had met for the first time the day before.Dove identifies as gender non-binary and uses the pronoun they Argento calls Dove \u0027she\u0027.          When the unthinkable happened and Argento received the devastating news that Bourdain, her lover and confidante of two years, had taken his own life in a French hotel room McGowan\u0027s phone call was one of the very few she answered      Messages: These are texts Rain Dove sent Asia Argento in which the non-binary model told her they had obtained toxicology and medical examination results and identified a prostitute Anthony Bourdain was with who had come from Russia. All those claims were untrue.  She believed it: Texts shared by Asia Argento show how she (in blue) had come to be convinced that her lover died with a prostitute while on drugs. She now knows that to be untrue  More claims: The texts show that Rain Dove told her they knew where the \u0027syringe\u0027 used by Bourdain was and that they had obtained post-mortem documents          Bennett claims: Asia Argento tells DailyMailTV that her strategy was not to deal with  \u0027terrorism\u0027 but Anthony Bourdain said she should pay him off with $380,000, which the chef provided, to \u0027get him out of our lives\u0027Shared: Asia Argento\u0027s sent these texts to Rain Dove in the form of screengrabs in which she and the CNN host discussed how to deal with Jimmy BennettSitting talking today Argento recognizes how crazy this all sounds.But then, she said, \u0027I am believing her because I am so fragile and I am looking for answers and she is giving me them, something to hold on to, a reason that he did it.\u0027DailyMailTV has spoken with another witness who was present in Berlin who backs up Argento\u0027s account about what Dove said and did. Text messages from Dove to Argento also back her story and show that McGowan was aware in July of Dove\u0027s actions, but telling Argento that she was not part of it.Argento said: \u0027I am a woman completely destroyed at this point. I don\u0027t know what day it is. I thought maybe this was Rose\u0027s Army that she spoke about. I thought maybe it exists.\u0027And when the Bennett allegations surfaced she turned to that army of women - which she called \u0027the network\u0027 for help.                             I was frozen and he was on top of me and after the act it felt weird.                        She said\u0027 \u0027I asked Rain if the network could help me some way.\u0027In response, Argento said, Dove started to tease out details of what had happened between her and Bennett - an event she is reluctant to label rape but she is certain she was the victim.She shared texts which show her disclosing the details of her and Bourdain\u0027s dealings with Bennett to Dove.She said: \u0027I said in the messages I was frozen and he was on top of me and after the act it felt weird.\u0027A picture of Argento in bed with Bennett proved particularly damaging to her claims of innocence but she maintained she was \u0027in shock\u0027 when it all took place.Argento  says the texts, first published by TMZ, were sold. Texts show Rain Dove denying that they had sold the texts.McGowan, through lawyers, vigorously denies to DailyMailTV that she was involved in obtaining or making money from the texts.Dove has maintained that they were not behind the leak of texts in which Argento told her that her interaction with Bennett had turned sexual but that HE was the aggressor.That leak came hot on the heels of a public statement issued on Argento\u0027s behalf denying everything.For Argento, she feels she is the victim again, this time of betrayal.She said: \u0027I am a single mother, I don\u0027t have work, I can\u0027t support both my children financially.\u0027But as she cops with the \u0027hole\u0027 opened up by Bourdain\u0027s death, she told DailyMailTV that there is hope.\u0027I am wounded,\u0027 she said. \u0027But I will recover.\u0027Daily Mail TV | Episodes, Showtimes, Video and more | Daily Mail Online"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/19/19/5069B20200000578-0-image-m-67_1537383218809.jpg","title":"Justin Bieber new fianc Hailey Baldwin watch couples wedding","story":"     Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin overlook the wedding at the Belmond Caruso Hotel in Italy          Rebecca Reed-Sperrin and Stefan Johansen tied the knot at the exclusive hotel in RavelloThe couple, who arrived in Italy after announcing their engagement, watched on as Mr Johansen, 31, and Miss Reed-Sperrin, 32, became husband and wife.Hailey Baldwin calls engagement to Justin Bieber the...Hailey Baldwin posts and DELETES an intimate picture...Share this articleMiss Reed-Sperrin, who got engaged to her man at the hotel 18 months ago, said: \u0027It was surreal.

A native of Sacramento, Honnold grew up near El Capitan and called it the ‘pinnacle of climbing.’ Honnold is pictured here on top of El Cap looking down          It took Honnold a year and a half to prepare for the free solo - meaning alone and without any equipment - climb of El Capitan. He told DailyMail.com that he climbed the mountain with a rope around 60 times (pictured with Honnold in red on the left with his climbing partner on the right) and he rehearsed his moves for the challenging parts of the formation over and over again          A new documentary, \u0027Free Solo,\u0027 shows how Honnold (pictured) would ultimately be the first person ever to climb El Capitan without a rope and alone, where one slip would mean death. On June 3, 2017, it took three hours and 56 minutes for him to scale the iconic and daunting rock formation          Honnold (pictured) told DailyMail.com that he thought ‘extensively’ about the risk: if he fell, he would have died. He said that is why he prepared so vigorously, working on difficult sections until they felt comfortable so that he would be able to solo the route. For one challenging part called the boulder problem, Honnold explained that he practiced on that section 12 times in a rowThe preparation to scale El Capitan without any equipment was vigorous and Honnold explained that he climbed it with a rope around 60 times, but ‘in a lot ways that doesn’t really do justice to how much I actually rehearsed because that’s only counting actual ascents where you start at the bottom and climb all the way to the top. I had many many days where I would hike to the top and then rappel back down to the ground just to work on one section.’If the route did not included certain sections, he said he would have been able to climb it immediately.Honnold said: ‘I would just go up and work on them in whatever way I could, so sometimes that meant climbing from the ground, sometimes that meant rappelling down from the summit, like hiking to the top and then rappelling down and… then one by one I just sort of worked on the sections until they felt comfortable, and then eventually, you know, once they all felt comfortable, was able to solo the whole route.’For example, for what is termed the boulder problem, which included doing a karate kick with no rope on the rock face to continue the climb, Honnold explained that he hiked to the top of El Capitan, rappelled down and then practiced it 12 times in a row.Masters of rock: Climbers shatter El Capitan\u0027s speed record...Daredevil climber makes history as the first to scale...Share this articleHonnold grew up in Sacramento, California, which is near El Capitan. In the film, he describes himself as shy and melancholic, often playing with Legos. He told DailyMail.com he started climbing around 10 or 11.‘To me it represents the ultimate in climbing and it has for many years,’ he said of El Capitan. ‘I’ve been thinking about it for, well, since 2009, which is pretty long time to be dreaming of something.’He called the documentary ‘very honest’ and a ‘very real look’ at the last two years of his life.In the beginning of the documentary, which starts in spring 2016, Honnold is living in a van - which he has lived in for nine years, six of those in a Walmart parking lot - and says he is \u0027trending\u0027 toward having a girlfriend, but that he \u0027will always choose climbing over a lady.’That girlfriend is Sanni McCandless, who meet Honnold while he was on tour for his book, ‘Alone on the Wall,’ in Seattle. When McCandless asked him to sign her copy, she gave him her number.The documentary traces the journey of their relationship: McCandless climbing with him, hanging out in Honnold’s van, how they navigate the risk of death associated with his lifelong passion and dream, the hiccups along the way when he gets injured twice, and getting a place together in Las Vegas.In the film, McCandless grapples with how to support Honnold in his pursuit while she worries that the endeavor could mean his death. ‘I’m not super stoked when he goes soloing because he’s already a big part of my life,’ McCandless says in the film.Before his first free solo attempt, which would not be successful, McCandless asks, ‘Would putting me into the equation actually ever change anything?’ Honnold says no, and that he wouldn\u0027t want to have ‘weird simmering resentment’ that ‘the things you love most in life have now been squashed.’           The documentary looks at Honnold\u0027s relationship with his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless (right). They met while Honnold (left) was on tour for his book, ‘Alone on the Wall,’ in Seattle. Here, as seen in the film, McCandless is cutting Honnold\u0027s hair before he attempts climbing El Capitan for the first time, an unsuccessful attempt that he ultimately bailed on   A new documentary, \u0027Free Solo,\u0027 features both Alex Honnold and Sanni McCandless (above) and their relationship. The film chronicles how Honnold climbs El Capitan without any safety gear, and McCandless grapples with how to support Honnold in his pursuit while she worries that the endeavor could mean his death          At the time the documentary was filmed, starting in late 2015 until his successful free solo of El Cap in summer 2017, Honnold had lived in his van for nine years (pictured above) but not because of financial necessity. Toward the end of the film, he buys a house in Las Vegas, which he shares with his girlfriend Sanni McCandless          As of now, Honnold told DailyMail.com that he has climbed El Capitan with a rope 80 times. Above, is Honnold (right) with Tommy Caldwell, (left), who is a professional climber, preparing with practice runs with equipment before Honnold\u0027s historic climb of the rock formation without a rope on June 3, 2017When Honnold does make the climbing attempt that ultimately proves successful, McCandless leaves Yosemite. In the film, Honnold says he didn\u0027t ask her to leave but that she understands it is easier if she’s gone. Tears form as she drives away, contemplating the \u0027weird thought\u0027 of that possibly being their last hug. By the time she is being interviewed, she is crying, and wondering what if something happens and she doesn\u0027t see him again.Honnold told DailyMail.com he is still with McCandless and ‘she’s awesome.’ After seeing the documentary, he reflected on his conversations with her and his family and ‘it’s a good reminder that I could maybe be a little more thoughtful or a little more kind.’He added: ‘It’s funny because I think my experience watching it is kind of the opposite of most audiences in that, I find all of the, you know, the first hour of so is my relationship and just my personal life, I find that really challenging to watch, but then the climbing I think is amazing and I love watching it. I think that it seems most audiences feel deeply uncomfortable watching the climbing but the rest of it they find enjoyable.’ Honnold’s father, who often took him climbing and whom Honnold describes in the film as a \u0027teddy bear,\u0027 died when he was 19. His parents orced before he died. His mother, Dierdre Wolownick, a French professor, says in the film about his free soloing, ‘That\u0027s when he feels most alive, the most everything (and) how can you even think about taking that away from somebody.’The documentary opens with Honnold climbing, his orange shirt bright against El Capitan’s granite rock – the only sounds are his breathing and the call of birds.‘I feel like anybody could conceivably die on any given day - soloing makes it feel far more immediate and much more present,’ Honnold then says during an interview in the film, and adding later, ‘That’s kind of one of the appeals of free soloing to take something that seems difficult and dangerous and make it feel safe.’Honnold processes fear differently - to the point that he gets a MRI during the film to see how he responds to risk. Free soloing is dangerous, and Honnold notes in the film that everyone who made free soloing a part of their life has died. The film also shows a montage of free solo climbers - John Bachar, Sean Leary, Dan Osman and Dean Potter – who had died.  When asked about this, Honnold pointed out to DailyMail.com that they didn’t all die soloing - some died attempting other high-risk activities such as BASE jumping.He said that he thought ‘extensively’ about the risk: if he fell, he would have died.‘I mean that’s why there’s a year and a half of preparation, that’s why it was so important to me to make sure that when I did it, I did it right because, you know, obviously, I don’t want to die,’ he said.           Free soloing - climbing alone and without equipment such as a harness or rope - is a dangerous endeavor. A \u002760 Minutes\u0027 segment, featured in the documentary, of Alex Honnold (pictured in red, right, with a member of the documentary film crew, left) stated that free soloing is so dangerous less than one percent of people who climb, attempt it. Honnold has done more than 1,000 free solo climbs, according to the segment          Documentary filmmaker Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi (left) directed \u0027Free Solo\u0027 with her husband Jimmy Chin, (right) who is a professional climber. Chin and Honnold have been friends for years and have worked together before. Vasarhelyi told DailyMail.com that they envisioned the project - a character portrait of Honnold - together          A behind-the-scenes look at the documentary, \u0027Free Solo\u0027 (pictured). The project started around October 2015, said Vasarhelyi, one of the film\u0027s directors, with filming in Yosemite began in earnest by spring 2016. She said the project took about three and a half years  to completeElizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, who co-directed the film with her husband, Jimmy Chin, said they both ‘took time to reflect on whether this was something we would even participate in because of all the ethical questions around it because the stakes were just simply so high.’Vasarhelyi, who is an award-winning documentarian of five films before ‘Free Solo,’ told DailyMail.com that they envisioned the project together.She said: ‘There’s this original anecdote about Alex as a kid where he found it scarier to speak to somebody else to ask them to be his partner than to go to climbing by himself and hence without a rope... It still always brings tears to my eyes when I think about this anecdote because I feel like we all have that in our lives, and the idea that this inidual, this kid went from that to free soloing is staggering for me, for us.’ Chin, a professional climber, and Honnold have been friends for years, and have worked together before, but Vasarhelyi had only met him once socially. It was when they got together before the project began that Honnold mentioned how he wanted to climb El Capitan without a rope.‘He had never said it out loud,’ before, she explained. ‘He truly believed there’s nothing worth making a film about unless it was El Cap. But it changed the game, you know.’Vasarhelyi said the questions were whether they trusted Honnold or not to make the right decision in the moment, and whether they trusted themselves that they could execute it well enough as well as brave the worst case scenario.‘It comes down to the existential question at the heart of the movie itself, which is the idea of a life well-lived. Alex thinks a lot of death, he knows exactly how he wants to live his life… and we both respect that deeply,’ she said.In the documentary, Honnold’s first attempt to climb El Capitan isn’t successful, and he ends up bailing.‘In some ways it’s kind of reassuring that Spock has nerves,’ Chin says in the film, referring to Honnold\u0027s stoic nature.          Jimmy Chin, (pictured), is a professional climber and has known Honnold and worked with him for years. Chin told DailyMail.com that everyone who went up the mountain with Honnold to film was an elite professional climber as well as a cinematographer          Initially, the documentary filmmakers, Vasarhelyi and Chin, did not intend to put the crew into the film (shown above, right, with Honnold, left in the red jacket). Chin said that it became clear while editing it that the crew was an integral part of the story. The film showcases Honnold\u0027s climb of El Capitan without a rope, and it also shows the crew - many of them professional climbers themselves - as they film and watch Honnold. Tension runs high because if Honnold had made a mistake, he would have died          El Capitan in Yosemite National Park in California (pictured) is considered the center of the rock climbing universe for many. Honnold, who was the first ever to climb it alone and without rope, said it represents the ultimate in climbing to him, and he has been dreaming of the free solo climb since 2009 Vasarhelyi, who has two children with Chin, recalled the project starting and her telling Honnold she was pregnant.‘We began filming about when I was seven months pregnant so like October 2015,’ she said.Filming, she said, began in earnest in Yosemite by spring 2016, and they spent three and a half years on the documentary.Chin told DailyMail.com that everyone who went up the mountain with Honnold was an elite professional climber and a cinematographer.He said: ‘It’s a small circle and so we all know each other. Several of them have been Alex’s climbing partners, I mean, they’re at that level. But Alex is at a totally different level. But the thing is it was a very close knit team, you know, part of why it worked so well, it was a very family, kind of intimate feeling production.’The crew is also featured in the documentary, building tension at the end as they watch Honnold make the historic climb.‘We went into the project not intending to put the production – myself or any of the crew - into the film,’ Chin said. ‘In the edit, you know, we really started to see that it was kind of an integral part of the story because it was kind of this group effort and this journey together and to exclude it, actually felt like it wouldn’t be an honest film.’Chin, who said he has been filming and working with top athletes for 20 years, said he has never seen anything like what Honnold pulled off.‘It’s hard to contextualize, it really in my mind is one of the greatest athletic feats,’ he said. ‘The stakes don’t get higher than performing perfectly when the stakes are that high for that long - that’s truly an incredible feat.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/25/13/509B45BA00000578-0-image-a-34_1537879502878.jpg","title":"Rare pinup photos o Marilyn Monroe set auction","story":"    Photographer Richard C. Miller met Norma Jeane Dougherty - Marilyn Monroe - in the spring of 1946, when she was just 19 years old. A few years earlier, while attending Van Nuys High School, Norma Jeane had married a neighbor\u0027s son, James Dougherty, to avoid being sent back to an orphanage because her current guardians were leaving the state. Among the many images that Miller made of her, this photograph depicts Norma Jeane wearing the wedding dress from her marriage to Dougherty           Miller was one of the first photographers to work with Norma Jeane during this early period in her blossoming modeling career with the Blue Book Modeling Agency           \u0027I had no idea when I was taking these pictures that she would become famous and that the pictures would become valuable,\u0027 Miller would later say. \u0027She was just a nice, sweet attractive girl with outrageous ambitions\u0027          Miller took a rarely-seen series of portraits of brunette starlet Norma Jean in 1946 when she was an up and coming Armed Forces pinup          Miller\u0027s prints will go under the hammer October 7  along with the original photographic model release form Norma Jean Dougherty signed on March 26, 1946          \u0027He used Norma Jeane at four or five locations over several days,\u0027 the late photographer\u0027s daughter, Peg Miller, told DailyMail.com          \u0027I can\u0027t remember anything because I was a baby at the time. But Jan, my older sister, remembered that we gave her a nickname, Nonny,\u0027 Peg revealsUnsure whether to call her Marilyn, Norma Jean, or Nonny - the nickname Miller\u0027s daughters gave Monroe years earlier when she came to their home for dinner - he couldn\u0027t muster a single word.\u0027I had no idea when I was taking these pictures that she would become famous and that the pictures would become valuable,\u0027 Miller would later say. \u0027She was just a nice, sweet attractive girl with outrageous ambitions.\u0027Miller\u0027s prints will be up for auction on October 7 - along with the original photographic model release form Norma Jean Dougherty signed on March 26, 1946.The rare collection, estimated to fetch up to $80,000, includes the white prayer book that actually belonged to Miller\u0027s wife, Margaret Dudley Miller.\u0027He used Norma Jeane at four or five locations over several days,\u0027 the late photographer\u0027s daughter, Peg Miller, told DailyMail.com. \u0027She evidently made enough of an impression that she came to dinner with us.\u0027I can\u0027t remember anything because I was a baby at the time. But Jan, my older sister, remembered that we gave her a nickname, Nonny.\u0027It was just one of those things children make up. When Dick saw her years later he didn\u0027t know what to call her, Norma Jean, Nonny or Marilyn.\u0027I remember being told the story of how she was sat at the dinner table telling everyone that she wanted to become a star.\u0027Our parents thought, yeah right, sure - you and 20,000 other hopefuls. But sure enough she made it happen.\u0027Norma Jeane was raised an orphan in Los Angeles, enduring an abusive, unhappy childhood before she married James \u0027Jim\u0027 Dougherty at 16 to escape a series of foster homes.After dropping out of high school, the teenager turned bored housewife until Dougherty went to sea with the Merchant Marines and she took a job at a defense plant.There, Norma Jeane caught the eye of propaganda photographers who visited the factory to take morale-boosting pictures of beautiful female workers.She quit her job and in 1945 joined the Blue Book Model Agency who would book her for advertisements and magazines such U.S. Camera, Laff and Pageant, a rival to Reader\u0027s Digest.Miller was one of the first photographers to work with Norma Jeane, his memorable image of her wearing her wedding dress and clutching his wife\u0027s prayer book appearing on the June 1947 cover of Personal Romances magazine.Months later Norma Jeane signed for 20th Century Fox where executive Ben Lyon urged her to combine the name Marilyn with her grandmother\u0027s name, Monroe.

By then she had dyed her curly brunette hair platinum blonde and had orced Dougherty because he was opposed to her acting career          By 1953 Monroe had appeared in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire and was well on her way to becoming a household name. When she ran into father-of-three Miller, while shooting Some Like It Hot in 1959 she was at the peak of her fame - but also problematic on set.By then she had dyed her curly brunette hair platinum blonde and had orced Dougherty because he was opposed to her acting career.Success was fleeting however and it wasn\u0027t until a near-penniless Monroe posed for a set of nude photos in 1949 that her career truly took off, the ensuing notoriety helping her land a series of big roles when the raunchy pics surfaced several years later.By 1953 Monroe had appeared in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire and was well on her way to becoming a household name.

She had the charismatic quality that good models have,\u0027 added Peg, 73, a retired professor of English and higher education policy.\u0027But he didn\u0027t like her on the set of Some Like it Hot. By that time she was really challenged. She had trouble getting to the set on time. She had trouble getting her lines out.\u0027He remembered the moment Tony Curtis famously finished a kissing scene then stood up and said kissing Marilyn was just like kissing Hitler.\u0027Monroe\u0027s troubled private life received almost as much attention as her bombshell looks as she struggled with substance abuse and depression.Her second and third marriages to baseball star Joe DiMaggio and the playwright Arthur Miller both ended in orce.Monroe died from an overdose of barbiturates at her Los Angeles home on August 5, 1962. She was only 36.Although the icon\u0027s death was ruled a probable suicide her demise has been subject to countless conspiracy theories.Many of those who worked alongside her, including Miller, harbored doubts.\u0027Fame was too much for her, it really was,\u0027 added Peg. \u0027My father was very skeptical of the idea her death was suicide.Bill Cosby is escorted out of court in handcuffsMeghan Markle arrives at the Royal Academy of Arts for \u0027Oceania\u0027Heartrending moment mom dog bids pup farewell after it was adoptedTheresa May rules out General Election before Britain leaves EUParascending pair injured after flying into electricity cablesHandcuffed Bill Cosby gets loaded into a police vehicleMcConnell says Kavanaugh will get a vote on the Senate floorKavanaugh to Martha McCallum: \u0027I\u0027ve never sexually assaulted anyone\u0027Martha MacCallum exclusive interview with Brett Kavanaugh and his wifeUnique \u0027tidal\u0027 art gallery at Males resort is destroyed by policeTrump thanks Kim Jong-Un for improved relations during UN speechMarilyn Monroe\u0027s wedding car goes on sale for $500k:...The glitz and glamour of a bygone era: LA\u0027s \u0027belle epoque\u0027...Royalty, presidents and \u0027the most famous elevator ride in...Share this article    The portfolio going to auction next week comprises 12 archival pigment prints capturing the youthful Monroe modelling by the pool, splashing around in the sea, fishing, carrying a cute puppy and playfully hopping a fence.           Miller, here in a self portrait with Marilyn, died in 2010 at the age of 98.

He admired her very much then, and he admires her to this day. Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Dolphin attended one high school event together and shared a brief kiss good night following that event.‘They had no other such encounter. The language from Judge Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook refers to the fact that he and Ms. Dolphin attended that one high school event together and nothing else.’However, Dolphin also contradicted the assertion by Kavanaugh’s lawyers that the two shared a brief kiss in high school.‘I think Brett must have me confused with someone else, because I never kissed him,’ she told The New York Times through her lawyer.Kavanaugh was one of 13 graduating seniors who reportedly mentioned Dolphin in some way in the yearbook. One former student, Michael Walsh, wrote a poem in his yearbook that said: ‘You need a date  and it\u0027s getting late  so don\u0027t hesitate  to call Renate.’According to a person close to Dolphin, she was aware of the poem being recited by her former classmates and requested that they stop saying it.Kavanaugh has come under intense scrutiny lately for allegedly sexually assaulting former classmates Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez. Both he and Ford are scheduled to testify in the U.S. Senate on Thursday, September 27.National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday 26th SeptemberWhat\u0027s coming to Netflix October 2018: New releases on the streaming siteSaina Nehwal and Parupalli Kashyap announce wedding after revealing \u002710-year relationship\u0027A replica of Meghan Markle\u0027s engagement ring is on sale at The Royal Collection shopSony allows cross-console play on PlayStation 4 starting with FortniteWho is Chloe Zhao?

View days: Multiple sources tell DailyMail.com that Rosie O\u0027Donnell is the top choice, while other names being floated around include Ann Curry and Lisa Ling (O\u0027Donnell and Barbara Walters on The View)          Emoitional: The Talk is also looking a frequent guests hosts Carrie Ann Inaba and Carnie Wilson per sources close to the production (Inaba in tears in the day Chen announced her exit)          Off they go: Chen is staying on for the next season of Big brother despite leaving The TalkThe Talk has used this tactic in the past as well, most recently prior to the show\u0027s decision to hire Eve.A host of women came on as guests hosts, including singer Michelle Williams and Inaba, after the departure of Aisha Tyler just before the start of the eighth season.Eve was not named as Tyler\u0027s replacement, however, until November, right in the middle of the most important time of the year for any television show - sweeps.It would be no surprise if history repeats itself, and a tune-in to unveil the new host comes in late October or November.In the immediate aftermath of Chen\u0027s departure Inaba stepped in to take her place as did Wilson, with more guest hosts slated to drop by this week. Chen announced the news at the end of the show\u0027s episode on Tuesday in a taped message, fighting back tears as she shared her decision with viewers.She had not yet appeared on the show\u0027s ninth season, and announced that she would be going on indefinite leave last Monday after CBS forced her husband to resign as CEO and chairman.Ten days later she made the leave definite, stating: \u0027I have been at The Talk since the day it started nine years ago and the cast, crew and staff have become family over the years.\u0027Right now I need to spend more time at home with my husband and our young son. So I have decided to leave The Talk.\u0027CBS applauded the hosts in the wake of the announcement on Tuesday.\u0027For eight seasons, Julie Chen has co-hosted The Talk with incredible energy, grace and professionalism. Her talents played a big role in our successful launch of CBS’ first network daytime talk show, and in the series growth into an Emmy Award-winning broadcast,\u0027 read the statement.\u0027All of us here have tremendous appreciation for the dedication and passion she brought to the show every day and for her generous role as an ambassador for CBS Daytime. We are grateful for her many other contributions, respect her decision and wish Julie all the best in everything she does.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/23/10/04CA23B0000007D0-0-image-m-4_1537693448612.jpg","title":"Murdochs Fox sell 39 stake Sky Comcast","story":"    Rupert Murdoch\u0027s family will no longer have a stake in Sky for the first time since he founded the company.

A native of Sacramento, Honnold grew up near El Capitan and called it the ‘pinnacle of climbing.’ Honnold is pictured here on top of El Cap looking down          It took Honnold a year and a half to prepare for the free solo - meaning alone and without any equipment - climb of El Capitan. He told DailyMail.com that he climbed the mountain with a rope around 60 times (pictured with Honnold in red on the left with his climbing partner on the right) and he rehearsed his moves for the challenging parts of the formation over and over again          A new documentary, \u0027Free Solo,\u0027 shows how Honnold (pictured) would ultimately be the first person ever to climb El Capitan without a rope and alone, where one slip would mean death. On June 3, 2017, it took three hours and 56 minutes for him to scale the iconic and daunting rock formation          Honnold (pictured) told DailyMail.com that he thought ‘extensively’ about the risk: if he fell, he would have died. He said that is why he prepared so vigorously, working on difficult sections until they felt comfortable so that he would be able to solo the route. For one challenging part called the boulder problem, Honnold explained that he practiced on that section 12 times in a rowThe preparation to scale El Capitan without any equipment was vigorous and Honnold explained that he climbed it with a rope around 60 times, but ‘in a lot ways that doesn’t really do justice to how much I actually rehearsed because that’s only counting actual ascents where you start at the bottom and climb all the way to the top. I had many many days where I would hike to the top and then rappel back down to the ground just to work on one section.’If the route did not included certain sections, he said he would have been able to climb it immediately.Honnold said: ‘I would just go up and work on them in whatever way I could, so sometimes that meant climbing from the ground, sometimes that meant rappelling down from the summit, like hiking to the top and then rappelling down and… then one by one I just sort of worked on the sections until they felt comfortable, and then eventually, you know, once they all felt comfortable, was able to solo the whole route.’For example, for what is termed the boulder problem, which included doing a karate kick with no rope on the rock face to continue the climb, Honnold explained that he hiked to the top of El Capitan, rappelled down and then practiced it 12 times in a row.Masters of rock: Climbers shatter El Capitan\u0027s speed record...Daredevil climber makes history as the first to scale...Share this articleHonnold grew up in Sacramento, California, which is near El Capitan. In the film, he describes himself as shy and melancholic, often playing with Legos. He told DailyMail.com he started climbing around 10 or 11.‘To me it represents the ultimate in climbing and it has for many years,’ he said of El Capitan. ‘I’ve been thinking about it for, well, since 2009, which is pretty long time to be dreaming of something.’He called the documentary ‘very honest’ and a ‘very real look’ at the last two years of his life.In the beginning of the documentary, which starts in spring 2016, Honnold is living in a van - which he has lived in for nine years, six of those in a Walmart parking lot - and says he is \u0027trending\u0027 toward having a girlfriend, but that he \u0027will always choose climbing over a lady.’That girlfriend is Sanni McCandless, who meet Honnold while he was on tour for his book, ‘Alone on the Wall,’ in Seattle. When McCandless asked him to sign her copy, she gave him her number.The documentary traces the journey of their relationship: McCandless climbing with him, hanging out in Honnold’s van, how they navigate the risk of death associated with his lifelong passion and dream, the hiccups along the way when he gets injured twice, and getting a place together in Las Vegas.In the film, McCandless grapples with how to support Honnold in his pursuit while she worries that the endeavor could mean his death. ‘I’m not super stoked when he goes soloing because he’s already a big part of my life,’ McCandless says in the film.Before his first free solo attempt, which would not be successful, McCandless asks, ‘Would putting me into the equation actually ever change anything?’ Honnold says no, and that he wouldn\u0027t want to have ‘weird simmering resentment’ that ‘the things you love most in life have now been squashed.’           The documentary looks at Honnold\u0027s relationship with his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless (right). They met while Honnold (left) was on tour for his book, ‘Alone on the Wall,’ in Seattle. Here, as seen in the film, McCandless is cutting Honnold\u0027s hair before he attempts climbing El Capitan for the first time, an unsuccessful attempt that he ultimately bailed on   A new documentary, \u0027Free Solo,\u0027 features both Alex Honnold and Sanni McCandless (above) and their relationship. The film chronicles how Honnold climbs El Capitan without any safety gear, and McCandless grapples with how to support Honnold in his pursuit while she worries that the endeavor could mean his death          At the time the documentary was filmed, starting in late 2015 until his successful free solo of El Cap in summer 2017, Honnold had lived in his van for nine years (pictured above) but not because of financial necessity. Toward the end of the film, he buys a house in Las Vegas, which he shares with his girlfriend Sanni McCandless          As of now, Honnold told DailyMail.com that he has climbed El Capitan with a rope 80 times. Above, is Honnold (right) with Tommy Caldwell, (left), who is a professional climber, preparing with practice runs with equipment before Honnold\u0027s historic climb of the rock formation without a rope on June 3, 2017When Honnold does make the climbing attempt that ultimately proves successful, McCandless leaves Yosemite. In the film, Honnold says he didn\u0027t ask her to leave but that she understands it is easier if she’s gone. Tears form as she drives away, contemplating the \u0027weird thought\u0027 of that possibly being their last hug. By the time she is being interviewed, she is crying, and wondering what if something happens and she doesn\u0027t see him again.Honnold told DailyMail.com he is still with McCandless and ‘she’s awesome.’ After seeing the documentary, he reflected on his conversations with her and his family and ‘it’s a good reminder that I could maybe be a little more thoughtful or a little more kind.’He added: ‘It’s funny because I think my experience watching it is kind of the opposite of most audiences in that, I find all of the, you know, the first hour of so is my relationship and just my personal life, I find that really challenging to watch, but then the climbing I think is amazing and I love watching it. I think that it seems most audiences feel deeply uncomfortable watching the climbing but the rest of it they find enjoyable.’ Honnold’s father, who often took him climbing and whom Honnold describes in the film as a \u0027teddy bear,\u0027 died when he was 19. His parents orced before he died. His mother, Dierdre Wolownick, a French professor, says in the film about his free soloing, ‘That\u0027s when he feels most alive, the most everything (and) how can you even think about taking that away from somebody.’The documentary opens with Honnold climbing, his orange shirt bright against El Capitan’s granite rock – the only sounds are his breathing and the call of birds.‘I feel like anybody could conceivably die on any given day - soloing makes it feel far more immediate and much more present,’ Honnold then says during an interview in the film, and adding later, ‘That’s kind of one of the appeals of free soloing to take something that seems difficult and dangerous and make it feel safe.’Honnold processes fear differently - to the point that he gets a MRI during the film to see how he responds to risk. Free soloing is dangerous, and Honnold notes in the film that everyone who made free soloing a part of their life has died. The film also shows a montage of free solo climbers - John Bachar, Sean Leary, Dan Osman and Dean Potter – who had died.  When asked about this, Honnold pointed out to DailyMail.com that they didn’t all die soloing - some died attempting other high-risk activities such as BASE jumping.He said that he thought ‘extensively’ about the risk: if he fell, he would have died.‘I mean that’s why there’s a year and a half of preparation, that’s why it was so important to me to make sure that when I did it, I did it right because, you know, obviously, I don’t want to die,’ he said.           Free soloing - climbing alone and without equipment such as a harness or rope - is a dangerous endeavor. A \u002760 Minutes\u0027 segment, featured in the documentary, of Alex Honnold (pictured in red, right, with a member of the documentary film crew, left) stated that free soloing is so dangerous less than one percent of people who climb, attempt it. Honnold has done more than 1,000 free solo climbs, according to the segment          Documentary filmmaker Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi (left) directed \u0027Free Solo\u0027 with her husband Jimmy Chin, (right) who is a professional climber. Chin and Honnold have been friends for years and have worked together before. Vasarhelyi told DailyMail.com that they envisioned the project - a character portrait of Honnold - together          A behind-the-scenes look at the documentary, \u0027Free Solo\u0027 (pictured). The project started around October 2015, said Vasarhelyi, one of the film\u0027s directors, with filming in Yosemite began in earnest by spring 2016. She said the project took about three and a half years  to completeElizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, who co-directed the film with her husband, Jimmy Chin, said they both ‘took time to reflect on whether this was something we would even participate in because of all the ethical questions around it because the stakes were just simply so high.’Vasarhelyi, who is an award-winning documentarian of five films before ‘Free Solo,’ told DailyMail.com that they envisioned the project together.She said: ‘There’s this original anecdote about Alex as a kid where he found it scarier to speak to somebody else to ask them to be his partner than to go to climbing by himself and hence without a rope... It still always brings tears to my eyes when I think about this anecdote because I feel like we all have that in our lives, and the idea that this inidual, this kid went from that to free soloing is staggering for me, for us.’ Chin, a professional climber, and Honnold have been friends for years, and have worked together before, but Vasarhelyi had only met him once socially. It was when they got together before the project began that Honnold mentioned how he wanted to climb El Capitan without a rope.‘He had never said it out loud,’ before, she explained. ‘He truly believed there’s nothing worth making a film about unless it was El Cap. But it changed the game, you know.’Vasarhelyi said the questions were whether they trusted Honnold or not to make the right decision in the moment, and whether they trusted themselves that they could execute it well enough as well as brave the worst case scenario.‘It comes down to the existential question at the heart of the movie itself, which is the idea of a life well-lived. Alex thinks a lot of death, he knows exactly how he wants to live his life… and we both respect that deeply,’ she said.In the documentary, Honnold’s first attempt to climb El Capitan isn’t successful, and he ends up bailing.‘In some ways it’s kind of reassuring that Spock has nerves,’ Chin says in the film, referring to Honnold\u0027s stoic nature.          Jimmy Chin, (pictured), is a professional climber and has known Honnold and worked with him for years. Chin told DailyMail.com that everyone who went up the mountain with Honnold to film was an elite professional climber as well as a cinematographer          Initially, the documentary filmmakers, Vasarhelyi and Chin, did not intend to put the crew into the film (shown above, right, with Honnold, left in the red jacket). Chin said that it became clear while editing it that the crew was an integral part of the story. The film showcases Honnold\u0027s climb of El Capitan without a rope, and it also shows the crew - many of them professional climbers themselves - as they film and watch Honnold. Tension runs high because if Honnold had made a mistake, he would have died          El Capitan in Yosemite National Park in California (pictured) is considered the center of the rock climbing universe for many. Honnold, who was the first ever to climb it alone and without rope, said it represents the ultimate in climbing to him, and he has been dreaming of the free solo climb since 2009 Vasarhelyi, who has two children with Chin, recalled the project starting and her telling Honnold she was pregnant.‘We began filming about when I was seven months pregnant so like October 2015,’ she said.Filming, she said, began in earnest in Yosemite by spring 2016, and they spent three and a half years on the documentary.Chin told DailyMail.com that everyone who went up the mountain with Honnold was an elite professional climber and a cinematographer.He said: ‘It’s a small circle and so we all know each other. Several of them have been Alex’s climbing partners, I mean, they’re at that level. But Alex is at a totally different level. But the thing is it was a very close knit team, you know, part of why it worked so well, it was a very family, kind of intimate feeling production.’The crew is also featured in the documentary, building tension at the end as they watch Honnold make the historic climb.‘We went into the project not intending to put the production – myself or any of the crew - into the film,’ Chin said. ‘In the edit, you know, we really started to see that it was kind of an integral part of the story because it was kind of this group effort and this journey together and to exclude it, actually felt like it wouldn’t be an honest film.’Chin, who said he has been filming and working with top athletes for 20 years, said he has never seen anything like what Honnold pulled off.‘It’s hard to contextualize, it really in my mind is one of the greatest athletic feats,’ he said. ‘The stakes don’t get higher than performing perfectly when the stakes are that high for that long - that’s truly an incredible feat.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Royal Mail begs customers not post CRISP PACKETS Walkers","story":"    Green campaigners have urged people to send the bags back to manufacturer Walkers as a form of protestRoyal Mail has been forced to step in and ask customers to stop posting empty crisp packets.Green campaigners have urged people to send the bags back to manufacturer Walkers as a form of protest against the packets being non-recyclable.Customers were also told to \u0027flood Walkers\u0027 social media with pictures of us popping them in the post\u0027 along with the hashtag #PacketinWalkers.Royal Mail is obliged by law to deliver the bags to Walkers, but as the packets cannot go through its machines they must be sorted by hand by workers.It called on campaigners to refrain from posting the empty packets into postal boxes, asking that they be \u0027properly packaged\u0027 in an envelope beforehand. More than 300,000 signed a petition by campaign group 38 Degrees calling on Walkers to improve on its target of creating recyclable  packets by 2025.The British manufacturer currently produces in the region of 11million new packets each day.\u0027I\u0027m a mix of Willy Wonka drinking an espresso martini......Snowboarder Ellie Soutter\u0027s father reveals pressure to fund...Share this articleA Royal Mail spokeswoman, said: \u0027If an item is addressed properly and carries the correct postage then Royal Mail is obliged by law to handle and deliver the item to the stated address.\u0027We strongly encourage customers not to post anything into the postal system which is not properly packaged.

Pictured: Kelly Edgson-Payne and her one-year-old son Lex, who live in Rochester, Kent \u0027There\u0027s just no consistency in their messages. They should not be discriminating against breastfeeding.\u0027 She continued: \u0027We fly with easyJet literally all the time, and I have always breastfed all my children over the years during take-off - because their ears pop and its uncomfortable for them.\u0027Most other cabin crew would actually encourage breastfeeding during take-off, because it distracts them and stops them from crying.\u0027I\u0027ve never before been told that I can\u0027t feed Lex, or any of my other children - and we\u0027ve flown with him about 16 times in the last year.\u0027\u0027So I got settled into my seat and I started to feed my son, as I would usually.          The mother-of-four (pictured with son Lex), from Kent, claims she was \u0027mortified\u0027 and she and her youngest child were both left in tears \u0027Then a male member of cabin crew came over and told me I couldn\u0027t feed him during take-off.\u0027Ms Edgson-Payne continued: \u0027It was just crazy. I said, \u0027Well, he\u0027s feeding\u0027. But I just had to stop mid-feed and hand him to my husband.\u0027I was mortified. I\u0027m not afraid to breastfeed my baby wherever - I\u0027ve stopped at a break point during a marathon before and fed him - but this left me embarrassed and in tears.\u0027I had to very quickly cover myself up - but my breasts were still leaking milk, because I had stopped mid-feed.\u0027Even my eldest daughter, who is nine, said, \u0027Mummy, they can\u0027t tell you not to breastfeed him\u0027.\u0027Ms Edgson-Payne, mother to Mia, nine, Elena, five, Jax, three, and Lex, one, said a female member of cabin crew approached her after take-off and apologised for the incident.She said: \u0027The two of them had a bit of a hoo-ha, and she then later came up to me and said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry about that, ignore him, he\u0027s wrong.\u0027          Ms Edgson-Payne (pictured with Lex) who says she has never had an issue breastfeeding any of her children on flights, has slammed the budget airline for \u0027not seeming to know the law about breastfeeding\u0027\u0027What annoys and disappoints me is that there is no consistency. On their website they state, \u0027We support breastfeeding mothers and you can feed your baby on board at any time\u0027.\u0027But when I emailed their customer services about it afterwards, I was told, Passengers are allowed to breastfeed their babies on board the aircraft, as long as you are doing this in a discreet manner.\u0027The ironic thing is, since having my third and fourth children, whenever I fly I have always booked my infant a seat next to me.\u0027So I\u0027ve never in the last six years sat next to a random passenger.\u0027Up until the cabin crew told me I couldn\u0027t breastfeed, I don\u0027t think any other passengers were even paying any attention to me at all.\u0027She added that all easyJet offered her in the way of compensation was a £25 voucher to be used on another flight with them.She said: \u0027I just want them to make themselves aware of the law so no other mums have to go through this.\u0027An easyJet spokesman said: \u0027easyJet supports breastfeeding and customers flying with easyJet can breastfeed at any time during the flight.\u0027It is not our policy to ask mothers to be discreet and we make this very clear in our training.\u0027This flight was operated by another airline on our behalf and while they should follow easyJet policies we are sorry this did not happen on this occasion.\u0027We have followed up to ensure this does not happen in future.\u0027           When she raised the issue with easyJet after she landed, she was told passengers are welcome to breastfeed babies on their flights - so long as they are \u0027discreet\u0027.

But Craig claims he looked through the conveyor entrance to see Swissport staff hurling bags on to the conveyor. Craig is a contractor for a flight simulator firm and arrived into Manchester on September 18 at 6.40am after a 17-hour flight.           In the meantime, passengers have shared pictures of their baggage, which could have been damaged at any point during their journeys to and from Manchester Airport  In the meantime, passengers have shared pictures of their baggage, which could have been damaged at any point during their journeys to and from Manchester AirportHe said: \u0027We were appalled to see our suitcases coming down the conveyor crushed.

He said: \u0027Alrighty guys, it’s very rare I do this, but I’ve just got off the plane from Italy and my brand new case is now completely ruined.\u0027This is a carbon fibre case from Crossrock who endorse me and sent me this out. This is supposed to withstand 1000kg of force.\u0027Whilst pointing at the case he says: \u0027This is a crack straight through, luckily and this goes out to them, the guitar is ok, but the hinges are broken, the guitar is fine.\u0027However this case retails at $1400. I don’t usually do this, but if you guys want to tag easyJet, I’ll put a link underneath.          \u0027Maybe they’ll actually take some notice because they’re doing this to a lot of musicians and I’m very fortunate that this case was strong enough to withstand it, but in any other case my guitar would be unworkable and the album would be un-do-able.\u0027They need to start taking care of musicians, because we put a lot of trust in them with something that is very valuable to us and clearly not very valuable to them.\u0027I mean look at that, that has been dragged all over the floor it’s soaking wet, it’s not acceptable.\u0027John posted the video onto Facebook and outlined his frustration at what had happened.He said: \u0027Destroyed $1400 carbon fibre case.\u0027Not acceptable  this has been obviously abused.          \u0027Lucky the guitar is alive, share this around folks! Airlines need to be held accountable for what they do to musicians.\u0027The post also attracted multiple comments from followers who were outraged by the Airline’s actions.David Scarlett said: \u0027All airlines should respect people and their broken possessions. How would they like it if we cut their seats, broke their screens or threw their food on the floor!\u0027Ferris Booyaa commented: \u0027Absolutely shocking treatment.\u0027Chris Baker said: \u0027What did they let the plane run over it? Good god what is wrong with people. No one respects anything anymore. Sorry that happened to you. And also to other musicians.\u0027Speaking today, John described how Crossrock tested out the case.He said:\u0027“They got a very large man to jump on the case from a stepladder.\u0027But, they also use a big pressing machine which is said to withstand 1000kg of pressure.\u0027He also said he was devastated with what had happened and has hoped that easyJet will take more notice of musicians possessions.He added: \u0027I’m very upset, this was the first flight the case was on. It’s clear that it was either intentionally damaged or not looked after all.\u0027It’s a shame, other airlines have managed to to destroy guitars, some of them £25,000 and upwards.\u0027They’re not just guitars, they are the livelihood of these musicians.\u0027EasyJet have apologised for the incident and say they are looking into the issue.A spokeswoman said: \u0027EasyJet has apologised to Mr Challis for the damage caused to his luggage whilst in transit and we are investigating this with our ground handling provider at Berlin Tegel Airport.\u0027EasyJet flies on average over 1500 flights per day across more than 30 countries and incidents of damaged luggage are extremely low.\u0027                         "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/25/17/50A7087100000578-0-image-a-16_1537892091241.jpg","title":"Suspects 1974 Birmingham pub bombings NOT named","story":"    21 people died in two IRA bombings in 1974 but upcoming inquests will now not name those believed to be responsible, a court has ruled  Julie Hambleton (left), whose sister Maxine (right) was 18 when she was killed in the bombings, said today: \u0027We will continue to fight for truth, justice and accountability\u0027\u0027Without the perpetrator issue how can you ever possibly finish the jigsaw?

Eventually he was convicted of possessing explosives and later sentenced to 12 years for separate terrorist offences.Throughout his trial he refused to say a single word because he refused to acknowledge the court.Murray was said to have delivered the devices to the home of associate James Gavin, a former British soldier, in Birmingham.On his release, he was welcomed back into the IRA and remained a member until his death in 1999. He never expressed any remorse for the bombings.One friend said: \u0027Mick was a hard man and, if anything, he was more hardline when he came out of prison.\u0027James GavinJames Francis Gavin, also known as Jimmy Kelly, has been accused of putting together the explosives for the bombs.He also stood trial alongside the Birmingham Six and was cleared on the conspiracy charge - the only not guilty verdict returned in the trial - but was found guilty of possessing explosives.He was given one year in jail, but because of time on remand he walked free.Gavin was said to be from County Armagh in 1963 and joined the British Army. He deserted in 1964 in West Germany.

So I say that with a great deal of confidence.\u0027We could have devoted significant resources to seeking to identify him without any certainty of success, and devoting those resources would not have been proportionate.\u0027Scammer who stole £113million from High Street bank...Architect is ordered to DEMOLISH his award-winning...Share this articleHowever, Masood continued to appear over the next six years with a series of \u0027selectors\u0027 - which turned out to be his phone number and email adress.The numbers were \u0027primarily\u0027 in the investigation of a \u0027long−standing associate\u0027 from Crevice as a part of a \u0027spin off\u0027 investigation.\u0027Witness L said it \u0027would have been possible to identify him from some of the selectors. It wouldn\u0027t have been proportionate to do so given that there was no evidence that he was engaged in anything of concern.\u0027In 2009 a second operation, named as Operation E was looking at a group of iniduals, who MI5 believed were seeking to travel to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan, an area which was heavily being used for terrorist training by al-Qaeda.  Khalid Masood (pictured left) murdered five people (including PC Palmer, right) and injured 50 others when he drove his car into pedestrians outside the Houses of Parliament in March 2017The iniduals were exploring the possibility that they might travel via Saudi Arabia and an inidual in there called Khalid Masood could assist them.A record was opened on him in February 2010, although the information was said to be \u0027reasonably vague\u0027 and \u0027uncorroborated\u0027.He was given a \u0027holding code\u0027 that meant MI5 believed he \u0027posed a threat to national security.\u0027By March 2010 they were satisfied that the inidual who was facilitating travel to the FATA was not Khalid Masood and downgraded him to an inidual who \u0027may be of interest to national security.\u0027MI5 obtained his criminal record and asked the prison service for details of his time in jail, although no record was kept of their response.In December 2010 an investigative review decided he should be downgraded to a target who was \u0027not considered to be of national security significance.\u0027          The security service took the \u0027correct decision\u0027 in closing their investigation into Masood in 2010, the inquest heard An internal minute dated 10 January 2011 recorded the meeting where the decision was taken in relation to a number of \u0027subjects of interest\u0027 (SOI) investigated under Operation E.Witness L said: \u0027The minute is brief and records the actions arising from the meeting, not the reasoning discussed at the meeting. It states that Masood should be closed as an SOI under Operation E. No reasoning is given.\u0027We have reviewed the decision to close Masood with the benefit of hindsight and concluded that the decision was sound.\u0027It is not feasible for MI5 to record every discussion held and every decision made during the course of an investigation.\u0027The case was not formally closed until October of 2012 for \u0027administrative\u0027 reasons and in between intelligence was received that he was associating with other subjects of interest.He was said to have appeared \u0027intermittently\u0027 in contact with a number of other subjects of investigation that we were looking at. that that included subjects of interest who were linked to the radical group organisation Al−Muhajiroun in the Luton and Crawley areas.But the witness said: \u0027I cannot see any evidence that we considered reopening him.\u0027In 2013 further intelligence was recieved that Masood had expressed contentment that the violent actions such as the World Trade Centre attack on 911 attracted people to Islam.Witness L insisted that even if the case had been reopened there was no intelligence that would have helped prevent the attack.\u0027There simply wasn\u0027t enough intelligence for us to work on that would have allowed us to identify his plot and therefore work with the police to frustrate it.\u0027 The inquest continues.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Moonpig asks customers stop using pics genitals cards","story":"    Blogger Rachel Hawkin\u0027s hilarious comment sparked off a hilarious back and forth between herself and Moonpig, while other users also chipped in with their ripostesMoonpig replied: \u0027As long as he\u0027s now aware,\u0027 before Ms Hawkins shot back: \u0027I’m working on it. \u0027Best way to deal with this is to not let him to do your photo cards and just buy standard ones.

Meghan closing her own car door before walking into the opening of \u0027Oceania\u0027 at the Royal Academy of Arts Royal experts are thrilled that their cast of characters is being expanded as Kate Middleton is returning to ‘work’ soon after her maternity leave - apparently those appearances at posh weddings were ‘private’ events, in case you wondered.This week the royal watchers went into overdrive, signalling that September 2018 will go down in the history books as the moment when a smiley mixed race woman finally dragged the British monarchy into the 21st century.It was accomplished with a simple- some might say humble- gesture, one that summed up (according to sycophants) her totally ‘modern’ approach to her new toff status. Yes, Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, CLOSED HER OWN CAR DOOR!JANET STREET-PORTER: It may be a Rotten public image, but let’s salute King of Punk John Lydon for letting it all hang out – and sneering at the Instagram generationJANET STREET-PORTER: Rees-Mogg\u0027s nanny-botherer is a nasty piece of work but I\u0027ve still got more time for him than Serena pretending her tantrums are a political protest JANET STREET-PORTER: Kim, Coleen and me and how an unfortunate few minutes of television turned into a terrifying witch-hunt of one of the nicest women I knowJANET STREET-PORTER: If Harry, Meghan and Eugenie want to live it large like reality TV stars they\u0027d better have a Plan B... when the paying public has had enough JANET STREET-PORTER: Boris Johnson is a buffoon but if there\u0027s one thing we all need to agree on it\u0027s that our society is built on the absolute freedom to disagreeJANET STREET-PORTER: If boys are growing up to become anti-social yobs, their parents must pay tooThe nanny-state panic over Britain’s heatwave makes my blood boil, says JANET STREET-PORTER. They know how to cope with the sun Down Under… so it’s time to send for the Aussies! JANET STREET-PORTER: If there was any evidence against Cliff he should have been tried in court, not on the BBC news by a hysterical reporter and a bunch of publicity hungry copsJANET STREET-PORTER: With their broken Heathrow promises, two-faced Theresa and duplicitous Boris have tossed their green principles in the trashArriving at London’s Royal Academy on her first solo engagement, to open Oceania, an exhibition showcasing the art and culture of the Pacific, Meghan stepped out of her limo - the door held open by a flunkey - then, turned around and closed it.Job done, she could get on with meeting a lineup of important people, delivering a short speech, and rubbing noses with a group of maori dancers and performers.Immediately, the Sun’s Royal Correspondent was congratulating the Duchess for showing she could still ‘take the time’ for these simple little tasks. Etiquette expert William Hanson offered up his take on door-gate, in case we hadn’t understood it’s importance - ‘it is usually done by others for security reasons’.I find that closing the car door is also a good idea if the weather is windy, in case it blows back on your leg, wrecking your £25 Wolford designer tights, or (worse) mows down a passing cyclist, who will start shouting obscenities.Meghan had clearly practised for this earth-shattering moment. Arriving at the launch of a charity cookbook in aid of the Grenfell survivors with her mother a few days earlier, she leapt out of the back seat and quickly shut the door.I’m sure security staff are already mulling over the implications of her impetuous actions - more of this kind of behaviour could result in staff redundancies.          The gesture generated praise for Meghan\u0027s humble attitude, but Janet Street-Porter is not convincedSadly, Meghan is not the trail-blazer we hoped - it has emerged that the Duchess of Cambridge has been shutting her own car door for some time, even whilst carrying Princess Charlotte in her arms back in 2016.Meghan might be trying to send a message that she’s the same simple girl, but as etiquette expert Mr Hanson reminds us ‘life is very different for Meghan now she’s joined The Firm -‘ no more selfies or autographs.No vote and no public social media’.Meghan says she’s a feminist who fights for women’s rights, but she signed away her chance to vote for our democracy. Maybe the chance to wear a procession of couture outfits costing thousands of pounds and live with a multi-millionaire made that bitter pill easier to swallow.          Playing netball in high heels at an awards ceremony in Loughborough this week was just plain daft, according to Janet Street-PorterAnd those four inch heels? They are not footwear women can fight in, they are unsteady and uncomfortable. A woman can wear what she chooses, but in Meghan’s position - cue the car door moment - everything she doessays and wears will be picked over.Playing netball in high heels at an awards ceremony in Loughborough this week was just plain daft. Meghan wants other women to feel comfortable and be themselves, not conform to hackneyed stereotypes, but she needs to lead by real example, not car door handle moments.She projects a very narrow, version of glamorous femininity, in complete contract to her mother, who seems much happier in her own skin and who has her own relaxed style.Fans gushed that the ‘door closing’ moment showed that Meghan was ‘humble’ and ‘down to earth’…’just like the rest of us’. According to the etiquette expert ‘she’s going to be doing things her way and helping to adapt and progress the British Monarchy’.As Private Eye would say, pass the sickbag. I find it’s easier to be modern when wearing a £2500 Givenchy dress and channelling Audrey Hepburn, although it’s not a look I plan to emulate on the London Underground any time soon.When it comes to Royal transport, Meghan is a fast learner, having made a mistake on her first public engagement with the Queen, by faffing about next to their car, and then asking Ma’am which side she fancied sitting on.Apparently the Queen ‘always sits behind the driver, although etiquette stipulates that the most senior person in a car should sit diagonally behind the chauffeur’.Just keep that pearl of wisdom in your mind, when you’re arguing about who gets the most leg room in the Uber home after a night out. And make sure you shut the door."},{"url":null,"title":"Prime Minister Theresa blasts Vladimir Putin UN","story":"    Theresa May launched a furious attack on Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury poisonings in an address to world leaders in New YorkMrs May also used her address to indicate Britain would bomb Syria again if chemical weapons were used against its people.In April last year Britain, the US and France bombed military bases near the capital Damascus and the city of Homs, following a chemical attack on the Syrian town of Douma. \u0027Britain is NOT turning its back on the world\u0027: Theresa May...‘It’s in both our interests to do a deal’: Theresa May hails...Share this article    Mrs May used a UN Security Council meeting on chemical weapons to attack Russia for the \u0027reckless\u0027 nerve agent attack with the country\u0027s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov (pictured) sitting only metres awayLater, in a major speech to the UN General Assembly, the PM turned her fire on Russia again, attacking authoritarian countries which \u0027crush the basic freedoms and rights of their citizens\u0027 and rounded on \u0027corrupt oligarchies\u0027 and \u0027aggressive nationalism\u0027.\u0027We have seen what happens when the natural patriotism which is a cornerstone of a healthy society is warped into aggressive nationalism, exploiting fear and uncertainty to promote identity politics at home and belligerent confrontation abroad, while breaking rules and undermining institutions. \u0027And we see this when states like Russia flagrantly breach international norms – from the seizing of sovereign territory to the reckless use of chemical weapons on the streets of Britain by agents of the GRU.\u0027           In a 20-minute speech to the UN General Assembly, the PM turned her fire on Russia again          Ridicule followed when the Salisbury assassins tried to pass themselves off as innocent tourists on a sightseeing weekend.

We saw its ‘spiracle’, or breathing hole, on the back of its huge, bulbous ‘melonhead’ and the ridge along its 5ft back.Benny spent the morning feeding around three barges – belugas are partial to cod, octopus, squid and herring – while moving slowly down towards the estuary, towards freedom and the Arctic Circle.‘The whale can feel the cold, saline water of the incoming tide which it prefers to the warm, fresh water of the Thames,’ said Clare Dew, of the RSPCA.The whale doesn’t know where it is in relation to the North Pole, but with luck it will navigate home using temperature as a guide. For the moment, Benny seems safe enough – but must be lonely. Belugas are sociable creatures and travel in pods of ten or more. In summer, they gather in groups of hundreds or even thousands.

This is one of the busiest shipping channels in the world and on the Essex side lies the port of Tilbury.Exactly why Benny has strayed so far from home is a mystery, said Miss Dew. ‘It might have been in a small pod that was following a food source, but got thrown off course by Hurricane Florence. Then this whale may have followed a separate food source.’Whatever the circumstances, the whale-watchers were delighted.‘I saw it first on Tuesday next to the barges,’ said Adam Brown, 34, a keen fisherman. ‘I knew it was something special.’Bill Cosby is escorted out of court in handcuffsMeghan Markle arrives at the Royal Academy of Arts for \u0027Oceania\u0027Heartrending moment mom dog bids pup farewell after it was adoptedTheresa May rules out General Election before Britain leaves EUParascending pair injured after flying into electricity cablesHandcuffed Bill Cosby gets loaded into a police vehicleMcConnell says Kavanaugh will get a vote on the Senate floorKavanaugh to Martha McCallum: \u0027I\u0027ve never sexually assaulted anyone\u0027Martha MacCallum exclusive interview with Brett Kavanaugh and his wifeUnique \u0027tidal\u0027 art gallery at Males resort is destroyed by policeTrump thanks Kim Jong-Un for improved relations during UN speech    Wildlife enthusiasts look at beluga whale swimming in the River Thames near Gravesend in KentSolita Herrera-Jorge, who came with Jose Morhino, said: ‘We sat and waited and then we suddenly saw it – and then we kept on seeing it, six or seven times.’The hospital receptionist added: ‘It’s very white and I could see it puffing.

Sadly, the whale died from convulsions.‘I’m worried this whale will get tired,’ said Mr Morhino. ‘It’s been there two days and it’s isolated.’A spokesman for the British Divers Marine Life Rescue said whale rescue pontoons were in place to refloat Benny if it gets stranded in shallow water, while whale-watchers are being encouraged to enjoy the views from the shore and not from boats.Like those assembled on the banks, I feel privileged to have seen Benny – but like them, I’m praying for its safe return home.Bill Cosby is escorted out of court in handcuffsMeghan Markle arrives at the Royal Academy of Arts for \u0027Oceania\u0027Heartrending moment mom dog bids pup farewell after it was adoptedTheresa May rules out General Election before Britain leaves EUParascending pair injured after flying into electricity cablesHandcuffed Bill Cosby gets loaded into a police vehicleMcConnell says Kavanaugh will get a vote on the Senate floorKavanaugh to Martha McCallum: \u0027I\u0027ve never sexually assaulted anyone\u0027Martha MacCallum exclusive interview with Brett Kavanaugh and his wifeUnique \u0027tidal\u0027 art gallery at Males resort is destroyed by policeTrump thanks Kim Jong-Un for improved relations during UN speech"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1936e16a708fd3c9db3af02aca658fb5610b800/0_61_2600_1560/master/2600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0858a649b7748733f0353d97189dfdaf","title":"eight great australian buildings from the sydney opera house to a wagga woolshed in pictures","story":"Eight Australian Institute of Architecture’s gold medal winners nominate a selection of great Australian buildings. As part of the 12th Sydney Architecture festival, on Saturday, a panel event at the Sydney Opera House will discuss the question ‘what makes a building truly great’Architects Lawrence Nield and Partners“Mt Druitt Hospital was part of a new health system by the Whitlam Government and brought a new architectural approach to hospitals and to public architecture. The plan was based on a computer simulation model optimising travel time for nurses and showing that a two-storey hospital had many advantages over the conventional six-storey hospital. All patients were in contact with the extensive gardens and greenery improving amenity and reducing bed-stay.”Nominated by Philip Cox, Cox ArchitectureArchitects Phillip Cox and Ian McKay“For an Australian building I would, hesitatingly, suggest Tocal College as a true expression of an Australian society and its heritage, especially given its affinity to an Australian landscape, its use of materials and honesty of space.”Nominated by Ken Maher, Hassell fellow and principal president of the AIA 2016-2017 Architect Jørn Utzon“Great architecture enriches our lives and lifts our spirits. Our own Sydney Opera House exemplifies the power of architecture to touch the heart. It amplifies the delights of our city, its harbour and its landscape. Its design responds to our climate and light, as delicately reflected in the sculptural beauty of the shells. Like much great architecture, Utzon’s design involved genuine technological innovation, and a robustness to accommodate renewal over time. These enduring qualities have ensured its place as a compelling symbol of our open and optimistic nation.”Nominated by Alec Tzannes, TzannesArchitects Denton Corker Marshall and Richard JohnsonPrizes 1994 Sir John Sulman Medal for Public Architecture“For a truly great building in this context, I think of Governor Phillip Tower and the Museum of Sydney, both exceptionally sophisticated buildings that capture the essence of Sydney through architecture. Located at the heart of a precinct that has the most prominent display of contemporary international architecture, these buildings stand out as testimony to the value of understanding local urban conditions to underpin the creation of world class architecture that is unique to Sydney.”Nominated by Keith Cottier, (retired) Allen, Jack+Cottier ArchitectsArchitects Peter Stutchbury ArchitecturePrizes 2005 Colourbond Award, Blacket Award for Regional Architecture, and the Energy Efficient Award“Prior to this building, little had changed in the Australian shearing shed over many years. As a result, the back-breaking work of shearing inevitably took place in sweltering temperatures, often over 40 degrees. The Deepwater Woolshed, constructed in 2005, rethought the shearing shed. Alongside optimal orientation to capture prevailing breezes, the large overhangs shade the walls and sheep access areas. A reticulated water system sprays cooling water on the roof and across mesh screen walls. A clever system of gates allows flexible and efficient movement and handling of sheep in a low-stress environment. Using simple techniques, the architects have provided the most comfortable environment for both sheep and shearers – and it still, unmistakably, continues the tradition of the great Aussie shed.”University of the Sunshine Coast Library, Sippy Downs, QueenslandNominated by Lindsay and Kerry Clare, Clare DesignArchitects Lawrence Nield in association with John Mainwaring Architects“This project entirely re-evaluates the traditional role of the library as a repository for books, to become an open ‘information exchange centre’.

Now, says artist Kazim Rashid , it’s time to talk about it Where did all the brown people go? It’s a question that British Pakistani artist Kazim Rashid has been pondering. The 1990s saw a boom in south Asian cultural output in the UK, from the success of Goodness Gracious Me to Panjabi MC’s crossover chart hit Mundian To Bach Ke and the Mercury prize win for Talvin Singh. The country seemed to be embracing the Blair government’s multiculturalism. And then, as Rashid identifies it, in the two decades that followed, silence.His response is the video installation 2001: Pressure Makes Diamonds. The work draws a through-line between three distinct events that took place in that year: Sheffield-born featherweight boxing champion Naseem “Prince Naseem” Hamed’s first defeat in April, the race riots that erupted across Oldham in May, and the fall of the Twin Towers in New York on 11 September. The 14-minute film pulls together open-source footage ripped from YouTube in an Instagram-style grid made up of nine squares to suggest that these instances marked a turning point in brown visibility – and a crisis of identity for south Asians living in the west.2001: Pressure Makes Diamonds started out as a novel, set amid that summer’s race riots. But the story felt too singular. Rashid wanted to understand the riots in a broader context to better make sense of them a moving-image work that put them in dialogue with news from around the world felt like a more effective format.He was keen that the story shouldn’t feel too colloquial, and so the video piece repurposes gruesome clips from a “sinister” White House press conference on the war on terror. By juxtaposing these with footage from his home town – born in 1987 to Pakistani-Kenyan immigrants, Rashid grew up in Oldham in “an incredibly white, working class area” – Rashid takes both a macro and micro view to a fault line of anti-Muslim sentiment in the western world. The Prince Naseem connection, however, is less obvious.“I was making this film for Adidas, and on one of the shoot days we were watching a boxing match in the green room,” Rashid says. “I had no relationship with boxing, but I couldn’t believe what I was watching. These giant men, fighting until they can’t stand up. It’s so scary, yet it’s like ballet. I was travelling a lot at the time, and started watching Naseem documentaries on YouTube in my hotel room.”Rashid was gripped by the sense of theatre in Hamed’s bouts – the boxer would emerge from clouds of dry ice and dance in the moments before a fight. He was also a proud Muslim: “I wanna thank Allah,” Hamed says to the camera in one of the clips used. “There’s also a clip where he comes out to some kind of Quranic verse,” says Rashid. “Even just watching it now feels dangerous.”It was when Rashid realised that Hamed’s doomed fight with Marco Antonio Berrera also took place in 2001 that things began to click into place. “I’m not a conspiracy theorist,” he says, “but I remember thinking this is the science. Naseem was taken down that year, at the same time as those race relations reached fever pitch, to the point where cities were on fire. Then 911 happened. This is no coincidence.”With its cut-and-paste mix of provocative news coverage and found footage, and a pop music soundtrack including a distorted version of Deepika Padukone’s Bollywood dancefloor anthem Dum Maaro Dum, 2001: Pressure Makes Diamonds immediately calls to mind African-American film-maker Arthur Jafa’s Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death, a looped seven-minute video installation set to Kanye West’s Ultralight Beam. It turns out Rashid is a fan. “I remember the first time, watching his work, like, is this a music video, or is this a documentary? What is this? I was just so connected to it. What I love about Jafa’s work is how he can show the rawest shit, and then there’ll be this moment of humour or lightness.”There is humour in Rashid’s film, too, especially in the way he presents footage of far-right racists who sound so absurd you assume they must be a parody. “Woah, woah! We came here for a peaceful demonstration! The Muslims attacked us!” yelp a pair of Manchester lads another scene sees a woman from Britain First declare: “We don’t want your mega mosque in our English town!”Yet the Oldham riots, which took place when Rashid was 14, were no laughing matter. “My dad was violently attacked while he was parking the car outside the house,” he recalls. “It just felt like everything was crumbling. I remember thinking, school’s mad, Dad’s getting attacked, there are fires in the streets, the Twin Towers went down, Naseem’s lost – it was mad. And after 911 it was so dangerous to be on the streets and look the way we did – the way we do. That must’ve translated to how people felt about what we made.”I ask why Rashid has made this film now, 17 years after the fact. “As with most traumas, time is a healer,” he says. “The wounds have healed just enough for us to talk about how we’ve been subjugated, how we’ve been oppressed, and how no one likes our skin colour. If we can say all these things out loud, it will help us to overcome them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca0b728b151e784c88acf46db8d8d736cebec8ea/355_155_5383_3230/master/5383.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a7e538e48b9ff9745d194f0b00f6c8c","title":"novel senses of new the 2018 goldsmiths prize for fiction shortlist","story":"As the 2018 shortlist is announced, the chair of this year’s judges explains how they hope to reward more than simple innovationThere’s a passage in Proust that offered useful guidance during meetings to judge this year’s Goldsmiths prize, about “artificial novelty” in a work of art being less effective than a repetition designed to reveal a new truth. (I imagine he’s implicitly defending his own method as a novelist.) What we were looking for – in a prize designed to reward the “genuinely novel” – wasn’t innovation as such, but writers able to take fresh possession of the form’s resources. Books that had strong advocates among the judges but couldn’t quite displace the six on our list have earned thanks for the pleasure they gave us – Jonathan Buckley’s The Great Concert of the Night, Jeremy Gavron’s Felix Culpa, Danny Denton’s The Earlie King \u0026amp The Kid in Yellow, Nick Harkaway’s mighty fantasy Gnomon.There have been novels in verse before, but the one we selected, Robin Robertson’s The Long Take, does a remarkable job of harnessing the dynamics of prose fiction and has a superb sense of time and place. The main character, a traumatised veteran of the second world war, sees the world collapsing around him a second time in the corporate destruction of Los Angeles as a liveable city. Cinephiles will particularly respond to the element of film noir, not a matter of vague atmosphere but specified shots, angles and film shoots.It’s not new to base a novel around a woman trying to make a success of a social occasion while other people fall apart, but this describes Olivia Laing’s Crudo as well as Mrs Dalloway. Laing’s Twitter-addicted narrator is getting married rather than throwing a party, but she’s much more aware of the fragility of her privilege, and collapse feels very near, even without the greedy, disruptive voice of Kathy Acker breaking through from page to page.Rachel Cusk’s Kudos is the final part of a trilogy, both of whose earlier parts were shortlisted in previous years, and it was clear to the judges that this vein of writing, undertaking a cool survey of the unbalanced present, is far from exhausted. In its early pages the book mentions the EU referendum campaign, but Kudos treats politics glancingly as a metaphor for the hidden inequalities within relationships and even the discontinuities within iniduals – “the question of whether to leave or remain was one we usually asked ourselves in private”.It would be a stretch to compare Guy Gunaratne’s turbulent In Our Mad and Furious City with Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying, though you could make a case for an overlap since both use competing monologues to tell a tightly focused story. The great success of the book comes from Gunaratne’s ability to give the rawest of material a sophisticated treatment without denaturing it, lovingly notating the language of the streets and not restricting himself to the voices of a single gender, ethnicity or generation.There couldn’t be a greater contrast between Gunaratne’s book and the quiet unspooling of Gabriel Josipovici’s The Cemetery in Barnes, which shows the powerful effects that can be achieved without ever raising your voice. In one way this is the most “literary” of the books on the list, with its deceptively serene progress and wide range of reference, but it is also charged with awareness of last things, all the threats to culture and happiness.There have been books, plays and films about Alan Turing before, but in Murmur, Will Eaves ambitiously inhabits the mind of a gay mathematician closely based on him under a different name, giving himself the freedom to explore an explore an obsession (what constitutes a person?) shared by novelists and thinkers about artificial intelligence. A novel is a low-tech device that passes the Turing Test – as long as it moves or excites you.• Adam Mars-Jones is the chair of judges for the 2018 Goldsmiths prize.

It also raises the cost of electricity.”The claims will be seen as a direct riposte to recent suggestions from the government’s infrastructure advisers, who urged ministers to cool their ambitions for as many as six new nuclear projects and prioritise renewables instead.The National Infrastructure Commission suggested the UK back only one more nuclear plant after the two reactors being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset.However, the New Nuclear Watch Institute, which is supported by nuclear industry firms including the South Korean company eyeing a nuclear project in Cumbria, said “technological zealots” were trying to restrict the range of options for cleaning up electricity generation.The group compared a worst-case scenario – where old nuclear plants are rapidly phased out, Hinkley Point C is cancelled, no nuclear plants are built and offshore windfarms and gas plants fill the gap – with one where nuclear plants account for nearly half of electricity generation by 2030.However, the comparison is based on an extreme scenario – few expect Hinkley Point C will be axed, given the billions EDF Energy has already poured into it.The government has repeatedly made clear it is committed to new nuclear plants but has been grappling with how to help the financing of their huge upfront costs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb8dd183506d1ff62ba4a899652d7582870f10a4/0_220_5476_3284/master/5476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bf98b02fc2337167c6c68a1a85da8b3","title":"mobile phone firms switch out of contract customers ofcom","story":"Regulator wants to stop estimated 4m users being overcharged for handsetsMobile phone companies could be forced to automatically move out-of-contract customers to lower monthly tariffs, under new rules proposed by the telecoms regulator to stop consumers being overcharged for handsets.In the face of increasing pressure to reduce overcharging, Ofcom has called on the big mobile phone operators to be fairer and more transparent with customers who bought their handset on a fixed-term contract that has ended.Consumers opting for a new, high-end handset typically agree to pay £37 or more for two years. The deal includes the mobile phone’s purchase and a monthly calls, text and data package.However, the operator will usually continue to charge the same amount each month, long after the contract has finished.Sim-only deals that offer the same amount of calls and data can cost less than £10 per month but consumers have to ask to be moved on to the cheaper tariff.Last week, Citizens Advice warned that up to 4m mobile users were being overcharged for phones they already own. It said the overpayment could amount to as much as £490m a year.Prompted into action, Ofcom has said it will consult on how consumers should be better protected. It has already required mobile operators to advise customers that their contract has finished – telling them to shop around – but is concerned too few users act on this.Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom’s consumer director, said: “Mobile customers should get the best possible deal. We’re concerned that people are not told, or cannot tell, exactly what they are paying for. So we are extending our work on behalf of mobile customers to ensure that handset charges are clear and fair – not just when they enter a contract but also when their minimum period is up.”Ofcom said it was exploring whether it should require providers to automatically move customers on to fairer tariffs at the end of the minimum contract period.Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said this was the obvious solution.“This move has the potential to make a real difference to consumers. However, while greater transparency around pricing would be a step in the right direction, what people really want is not to be charged for products they already own.“Companies should automatically stop charging people for handsets once they’ve paid them off. Of Ofcom’s proposed solutions, this is the only one that would make sure people aren’t unfairly overcharged,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5072ccf2fddd4912693e61ff421d332b1a8c1ffb/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d97c62354beab624005759642fba8992","title":"uber and citysprint among gig economy firms to face parliament","story":"Frank Field MP launches inquiry examining law and enforcement as firms still ‘evade justice’ on worker rightsUber and courier firms including CitySprint are to be called to give evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into gig economy companies that have continued to deny workers employment rights despite tribunal rulings.Frank Field MP, chair of the work and pensions committee, is to see if changes to legislation and enforcement are needed to ensure workers have their legal employment rights.The new inquiry comes after a string of tribunal rulings against companies, including Uber, eCourier and CitySprint, which ruled that couriers and taxi drivers should be classified as workers and be entitled to holiday pay and the minimum wage. The companies failed to deliver those rights across their workforce, and argued that their drivers and riders were self-employed contractors.“The inquiry will, I hope, shine a bright light on the extent to which justice is being evaded in the gig economy,” said Field, who resigned the Labour whip late August. “We will be looking to suggest any immediate changes that are required, both to the law itself as well as its enforcement, to ensure no company is able to evade justice.”The inquiry launches as Uber continues to fight a 2016 tribunal ruling that said its drivers were workers and not self employed. The latest round is expected to be heard at the court of appeal late in October. Since the tribunal ruling Uber has offered some improved conditions for UK drivers, including limited insurance, limits on working hours and a 24-hour phone line for support.Uber has repeatedly insisted that most of its drivers wanted to retain the flexibility to choose their own hours. However, the firm continues to face criticism over conditions. Couriers working for its Uber Eats takeaway delivery service this week protested outside the company’s London head office over a change in pay structure, which they said left them out of pocket.In November 2017 CitySprint was accused of making a mockery of Britain’s employment rights system after changing couriers’ contracts rather than giving them the minimum wage and holiday pay, despite losing an employment tribunal case on the issue.In May 2017, eCourier, a subsidiary of Royal Mail specialising in same-day deliveries, admitted it had incorrectly classified a London-based bicycle courier as an independent contractor and had wrongly denied him standard employment benefits. The company immediately announced a review into how it could implement the same worker status “for colleagues where it reflects their actual working arrangements with us”.Ian Oliver, chief executive of eCourier, said: “We did carry out a review of our fleet of drivers and identified a group who we felt could be ‘workers’. Accordingly we changed their contracts to provide benefits such as holiday pay. They were also offered a workplace pension.”But the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain said it was frustrated that there had been no sign of significant change. Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the union, which has been involved in a number of tribunal actions on workers’ status, said: “For a couple of years now we have been winning tribunal claims against courier and private hire companies. Yet despite this somehow these workers are still not getting the rights they’re entitled to. The enforcement system is clearly broken and this inquiry will shine a welcome spotlight on its abject failure.”Field will be gathering evidence from inidual workers, legal experts, enforcement specialists, trade unions and companies, with a view to publishing his findings alongside a series of recommendations before Christmas. The government’s director of labour market enforcement, Sir David Metcalf, will also be invited to contribute to the inquiry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/608a6a110bd841198a31d26e1c1ab69d4b7cc91a/30_261_3944_2366/master/3944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=446faeafe4b1026c6137d42fcbe68427","title":"big business should look in mirror before damning labour plans","story":"CBI should examine own record and consider why trust in business has fallen so sharplyLack of business experience in the Labour party too often “fuels ideas that are appealing on paper or conference platforms but unworkable in reality”, said Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, after hearing Jeremy Corbyn’s conference speech in Liverpool.UK pension funds would be also be heavy losers if their investments were diluted by a tenth. And companies might just try to flatten wages.So, yes, more business experience might have produced a better designed plan, especially as most large quoted companies run employee share schemes already, as Fairbairn noted.But Fairbairn and the CBI, before they accuse Labour of having a tin ear, should examine their own record and consider why trust in business has fallen so sharply. Where is the aggressive business-led campaign to shame corporate tax avoiders into paying their fair share? Where is the outrage over boardroom pay excesses?It is possible to hear CBI folk give virtuous speeches on these subjects – but usually only in vague terms. “We’ve got much more to do on trust, on transparency and on gender pay,” the then president Paul Drechsler said in May. But then you get absurdly defensive statements from the CBI such as the one that followed the damning report by two cross-party committees into the collapse of Carillion.“The language of the report suggests committee members think business in general is greedy and reckless,” opined the CBI, which was a complete mis-reading of what was said. MPs had stated: “Most companies are not run with Carillion’s reckless short-termism.” The CBI has subsequently tried to sound angry about Carillion but, really, if the first reaction on reading a 100-page evidence-based report into a collapse of a major outsourcer is to see an attack on business in its entirety, one wonders whether minds are truly open.Or try a subject that Corbyn didn’t mention yesterday but could have done – the big auditors. A debate currently rages about whether the Big Four auditors should be broken up to address conflicts of interests, declining standards and scandals that extend further back than Carillion. What’s the CBI’s take? The audit profession “must continue to evolve”, it says, which is meaningless. You do not have to be a cynic to suspect the CBI’s reticence may be connected to the fact that all four big auditors are among its leading members.That’s a fair analysis. There is more lip service to inclusive capitalism than actual delivery. Big business, if it really wants to build on “common ground” with Labour, as Fairbairn suggests, could also usefully remove a few blinkers itself. Outsiders’ frustration has not arisen out of thin air.Third, Disney could use the £12bn proceeds from flogging the shares. It is in the process of buying the bulk of Murdoch’s US empire for $71bn and needs cash to keep debt under control and to invest. Common sense has prevailed, as always seemed likely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eef69032a89125acd3b7f833cc0d78bae5d1fac/0_177_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2037fb28438d22177120997f5b16c8a7","title":"jeremy corbyn labour conference speech verdict panel liverpool","story":"The point of a Jeremy Corbyn speech is chiefly just to be Jeremy Corbyn. He doesn’t really do the big economic ideas – that’s more John McDonnell’s thing – and there isn’t always much of a grand argument connecting the various promises. But that’s not why people come. They come to be inspired and lifted up, reminded of why they were drawn to the energy of this movement in the first place – perhaps especially after a conference that has exposed some serious isions, on Brexit and on deselections. And so that’s what they got.Corbyn’s performances are infinitely slicker now better jokes, an altogether more prime ministerial demeanour. But he hasn’t lost the passion of the core material, from promising instant recognition for a Palestinian state to hammering the human consequences of mental health cuts or the “hostile environment” Corbyn said welfare policy had created for disabled people (although there were still no detailed commitments on how to dismantle it). Add in a juicy free childcare promise, and the manifesto for a possibly imminent general election is taking shape.But there’s still a big Brexit-shaped hole in the middle. Corbyn reiterated that Labour will almost certainly vote against whatever plan Theresa May produces, but oppose leaving with no deal instead it would demand a general election. But failing that, “all options are on the table”. The words were muttered, almost as if he didn’t really want to say them, and that was that. Nothing ruled in, or out, should the Tories decline to help Labour out by calling an election they would expect to lose.After five days of shadow ministers furiously contradicting each other, we are no clearer on what Labour’s preferred Brexit solution would be, so presumably that’s exactly how Corbyn wants it: the strategy is to offer a blank slate, on to which both leavers and remainers can project whatever they want to believe. If the aim is to reassure supporters unhappy with the Brexit position by reminding them of everything they do like about Corbynism, it got him through conference. Let’s see how it survives the turbulent weeks to come.Labour has spent the past few months wrapped up in knots, under relentless siege, leaving the party demoralised from the grassroots to the very top. A barrage of attack drowned out a coherent radical message forged by last year’s general election campaign. It badly needed a reset button, and it got one. A conference featuring little disunity and an agenda-setting speech on workers’ ownership by John McDonnell climaxed with Corbyn’s best address to date. Three years ago, a relatively obscure backbencher, condemned to the fringes of politics for several decades, had been catapulted to the frontline, and it showed in a stumbling speech. This year, a mostly hostile press pack muttered reluctant praise: he looks the part of a prime minister-in-waiting.As Margaret Thatcher once used the podium to condemn the postwar consensus and sketch out a new order, Corbyn delivered a speech that was an unapologetic onslaught on a crumbling neoliberal ideology. Old-style, top-down nationalisation was junked: instead, there would be democratic ownership by workers and consumers. After a decade of austerity, which the latest polling shows the public is thoroughly fed up with, investment was championed as a means to modernise Britain. Climate change was identified as the greatest crisis facing humanity – but he made it a bread-and-butter issue, pledging to commit hundreds of thousands of “green” new jobs.It is the antisemitism crisis that has tortured Labour for the past few months, and Corbyn showed necessary empathy towards Britain’s Jews over the horrors visited upon them for centuries and the hurt caused by antisemitism, and he pledged to be an ally against racism. He was right, too, not to take any lessons from a Tory party responsible for the Windrush scandal, a “hostile environment” for immigrants and championing Viktor Orbán’s antisemitic far-right regime.But one of the most critical elements of the speech was a direct appeal to older people, “who built modern Britain”, and a commitment to repay their efforts and sacrifice by protecting the triple lock and a national care system. Labour has catastrophically low levels of support among older people, and the party has failed to build on the Tories’ attempt to abandon the triple lock in last year’s fateful election. If an all-out charm offensive among pensioners is successful, then Corbyn will be assured of becoming the next prime minister – and Britain’s leftwing answer to Thatcher.Brexit may have dominated Labour conference this week, but not so Corbyn’s speech. He couldn’t even bring himself to mention the second referendum that’s now Labour’s official Brexit policy.The meat of the speech was on much more comfortable territory. MPs in leave areas have been complaining the party’s policy offer has too much of a cosmopolitan feel, and not enough that speaks to their communities. The once-flagship policy to scrap tuition fees didn’t even get a mention. It was packed instead with announcements to appeal to those May once called the “just-about managing”, with a big pledge on free childcare for two-year-olds and rebalancing the economy towards workers a strong theme.“Join us in the new political mainstream,” Corbyn invited Jim O’Neill, a former Tory Treasury minister and chief economist of Goldman Sachs, who wrote that Labour has “stepped into the vacuum left by the government”. Although one had the sense he would relish a more full-blooded challenge from business. The muted nature of its opposition to Corbynomics – not to mention the absence of internal dissenters – shows just how much the ground has shifted.But there were gaps. Why didn’t Corbyn pledge to extend the “pure socialism” of the NHS to social care, telling people that if they are unlucky enough to get dementia they’ll get free care, as they do with cancer? Where was the offer for the predominantly working-class young people who don’t go to university? Where was the massive reskilling programme for people who lose their jobs to automation? And Corbyn went no further than he has done in the past in acknowledging the nature of left antisemitism, leaving questions hanging about his leadership qualities.But the subliminal message couldn’t have been clearer: Labour won’t be actively campaigning for a referendum any time soon. And no number of workers on boards will be able to fix things if Labour gets the keys to No 10 in the wake of a messy, no-deal Brexit.• Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer and deputy opinion editor at the Last year’s conference was always going to be tough to follow. In 2017, Corbyn was riding high on the unexpected general election result this year, his summer has been defined by accusations of antisemitism and Brexit disagreements. Popular policy announcements on the environment, childcare and housing in Liverpool this week depicted a party preparing for government. Corbyn’s task today was to prove he was, too.There was a marked improvement in Corbyn’s delivery. After a string of uncomfortable TV interviews, there was an air of confidence today from the leader. The jokes landed, as did the moments of high emotion. There was also a nod to the personal: Corbyn offered an emotional thank you message in Spanish to his wife. It showed a side he prefers to keep hidden.On antisemitism, the tone had already been set: yesterday, during her conference address, Emily Thornberry’s vocal support for the Palestinian people received rapturous applause. So too did her ultimatum to the few antisemites on the fringes of Labour. Today, Corbyn’s acknowledgement of the pain British Jews are in was met with his first standing ovation. Chuka Umunna’s assertion that Labour is institutionally racist? Again, disproved.In fact, “I” and “we” were used repeatedly on antisemitism – again, the personal – and a hand was reached out to the Jewish community: “I hope we can work together to draw a line.” Yes, it could have gone further: another apology for the hurt, for instance. But that’s a conversation Corbyn needs to have with Jewish people directly.Labour’s detractors, both inside and out, wanted this conference to be defined by internal warfare – but thresholds, trigger ballots and party splits got no mention. The Farm’s All Together Now played as Corbyn entered – there were no signs of ision in the packed-out hall. Instead, this speech was an outward-looking message to the nation: an hour of policy, and plans to deliver them.A look to the Liberal Democrats or to the Tories would suggest that neither of their leaders would have enough material to do the same. And that should worry May, because on ideas Labour is winning the argument. Corbyn’s performance today suggests that on leadership Labour can win as well.• Michael Segalov is a contributing editor at Huck magazine, a freelance journalist and authorThus begins the general election campaign, and the battle lines are clear. Corbyn will join battle as the Great Repairman, answering a decade-old call to rebuild a fair economic structure upon the wreckage of the 2008 crash and to address the “social vandalism” of subsequent Tory policy.This will resonate, and the Conservatives need to brace themselves for what they will doubtless regard as the unmerited popularity of Corbyn’s economic populism. Like so many party leaders before him, he pledged a green revolution, “the biggest home-building programme in half a century”, free childcare, and the transformation of employees into company stakeholders.How he will accomplish this, afford it, and prevail where others have failed, he did not say. But that’s the essence of populism: the promise of straightforward solutions to complex problems. It’s the formula that got Donald Trump into the Oval Office.Like Trump, Corbyn has also carefully selected his enemies. The section on press freedom was properly sinister, especially delivered, as it was, by a past contributor to Press TV and Russia Today. His benign portrayal of Labour as a “broad church”, committed to “listening and learning”, will have baffled those centre-ground MPs who are now at a much higher risk of deselection thanks to reforms at this week’s conference.His pledge to Jewish people that “we are your allies” also sounded less like an apology than the voice of a leader impatient to move on from the headline-grabbing crisis of trust that consumed Labour’s summer.And Brexit? Keir Starmer had bounced him into leaving “all options on the table” – including, by implication, a people’s vote, with “remain” included on the ballot paper. But it is clear enough that Corbyn wants out of the EU so he can build socialism in one country.Will he get the chance? To my ears, this was the speech of a veteran campaigner rather than a prime-minister-in-waiting. I still don’t believe he has what it takes. But the game is certainly on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b547dddb1944047e5816a6a081fac07d98ae85b7/0_2_4470_2682/master/4470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c0a4f1c55aa76d57a6937eef5aae5e2","title":"may tories truth migration impact uk economy","story":"Theresa May’s claim that the UK should focus on attracting “the brightest and the best” immigrants from around the world sounded hollow even before the ’s reporting of the Windrush scandal exposed the worst excesses of the “hostile environment” policy. In fact, in her time as home secretary the government did its best to reduce the number of students and skilled workers coming to the UK, most absurdly by imposing an arbitrary cap that excluded even much-needed doctors who had already been hired to fill vacant posts.So is it good news that the government will broadly accept the recommendations of the migration advisory committee (MAC) to liberalise the rules for skilled workers from outside the EU, while at the same time applying those same rules to workers coming from the EU – so ending the “low-skilled” migration that currently flows to the UK under freedom of movement?The MAC analysis included new research suggesting that immigration boosts productivity, and that migrants are likely, over their time in the UK, to contribute far more to the public finances than they cost public services or the benefits system. Meanwhile, any negative impacts on training, jobs or wages for UK workers are relatively small. It also suggests, unsurprisingly, that higher-skilled or higher-paid workers are likely to have a greater positive impact. It even debunks simplistic claims that immigration has undermined community cohesion at a local level. All this represents a welcome injection of facts into a debate long dominated by scaremongering.But the MAC conclusions, as endorsed by the cabinet, don’t necessarily follow from their analysis. It’s often assumed in this debate that migrants are either “the brightest and best” or here to do menial jobs. That’s just not true of migrants any more than it’s true of the rest of us. In fact, these proposals would exclude not just low-skilled workers but almost everyone earning under £30,000, well above average full-time earnings. So this wouldn’t just hit fruit-pickers and baristas but butchers, primary school teachers, radiographers and so on. None of these – and many others – are jobs that can be done without training or qualifications. So while making it easier for skilled workers to come here makes sense – and may undo some of the damage of the May years – it may get much harder to fill a lot of jobs that the UK economy needs.Moreover, the case for maintaining some form of free movement with the EU even after Brexit is considerably stronger than the report suggests. It’s true that the current system, where it is much easier for EU migrants to come here than non-EU ones, is far less “selective” for the former than the latter. But despite this, EU migrants still have higher employment rates and make a larger fiscal contribution than either people born here or migrants from elsewhere. This suggests that free movement, “uncontrolled” as it is, isn’t working out too badly for the UK.Of course, it’s always possible in principle to improve things even more by being more “selective”. But selection has to be applied in practice, not by a perfect system but by bureaucrats in Whitehall. Where’s the evidence that government central planning will in fact outperform a largely market-driven system? Much remains to play for. Take the care sector, where the MAC argues that the real problem driving recruitment and retention of staff is sustained government underfunding. It’s hard to argue with that.But, after Brexit, is the government really going to break the habit of at least two decades and fund the sector properly? Will it just let services get worse and worse, or will it introduce a special scheme, despite the MAC recommendation that it do no such thing? In practice, when the potential impact of these proposals becomes apparent, some modifications are likely. And that’s before we’ve begun the real work of negotiating the detail of the future trade deal between the EU and the UK, which will inevitably contain some provisions on labour mobility: the MAC carefully ducked this issue.More broadly, the cabinet hasn’t yet made the big decisions. The cabinet, Conservative party and country more widely (especially those who voted for Brexit) are ided. Some recognise that – after Brexit, more than ever – the economy needs a relatively liberal immigration system, particularly if we are going to make a reality of “global Britain”. The new evidence backs them up, and suggests that if free movement is indeed to end, that logically means a substantial liberalisation of the rest of the system, rebalancing it in favour of non-EU migrants – unless we want to do still further damage to the economy and public finances. This view is increasingly shared by the UK public, which in recent years has become significantly more positive about the impact of immigration.Some, however, led by the prime minister, either don’t believe the evidence or simply don’t care. Their view remains that reducing immigration – both from within the EU and outside – is the main political priority, and overrides everything else, including the economy. That argument is a long way from being settled.• Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, and a senior fellow of the UK in a Changing Europe programme"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1be516830fb0981fb07dd99786eea628e5112b7/0_0_650_396/master/650.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4bbd608b274b05c2e127983abe549a7 465w","title":"back from the brink the global effort to save coral from climate change","story":"Underwater nurseries offer glimmer of hope for endangered ecosystems, encouraging growth of coral fragments on fibreglass structures anchored to the seabedAs an ocean early warning system, coral reefs have been sounding the alarm for years. They have been bleached white by marine heatwaves and killed off en masse by a combination of factors including pollution, overfishing, acidification and climate change.But now scientists in Florida, and other tropical locations worldwide, are attempting to stop the rot by creating coral “nurseries” in which young populations can be raised in controlled conditions before being planted on denuded reefs.Off the southern tip of Florida, a sprawling marine farming operation has been established in which corals are painstakingly grown on anchored fibreglass trees and then planted on the barrier reef.“The idea is to do as much as we can now to give these coral populations a fighting chance,” says Jessica Levy, programme manager at the Coral Restoration Foundation. “If you don’t put back the material and ersity that has been lost, the populations are going to crash and become extinct. For reefs, you’re looking at a global extinction of the ecosystem if things don’t change quickly.”The maladies are numerous and stretch back decades. A burgeoning Floridian population and mass tourism have led to water pollution and direct damage to corals, while agriculture has sent torrents of nutrients flowing on to the reef.Although regulations have curbed some of these local risks, climate change remains a big threat. In 2014 a spike in water temperatures led the Florida corals to bleach – when a reef expels its symbiotic algae under heat stress, whitens and potentially dies. It happened again in 2015, as a prolonged global bleaching event gripped the planet’s corals. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef was cooked to the point that it reportedly smelled of death.The world is on course for a temperature increase that will comfortably wipe out most of the coral ecosystems, a scenario that would strip away a crucial nursery and smorgasbord for countless marine species, diminish fisheries and remove a vital coastal buffer to storms that will intensify as the planet warms.“The outlook for the Florida reef is pretty grim,” says Kim Cobb, a coral expert at Georgia Institute of Technology. “The threats are overwhelming. Just as the reef is climbing out of decades of systemic problems it is under increasing threat from climate change.”The Coral Restoration Foundation has increased the replanting of corals as the situation has deteriorated, and the foundation’s underwater trees are becoming sought-after items for stressed reefs around the world.Partnerships have formed to provide trees to places such as Jamaica and Colombia. A chartered fishing operation in Mexico is in talks to do the same. This month, it was announced that 100 corals had been successfully planted on the Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest living structure, using the coral tree frames.The operation came about after tropical fish collector Ken Nedimyer noticed a rare type of coral called Acropora cervicronis growing on his live rock farm in 2003. A loophole in endangered species laws meant the coral was his to keep, so he began cutting it up to grow new coral from the fragments.Nedimyer hoped to regrow enough coral to start patching up Florida’s reef. Initially, the fragments were mounted on sunken concentric blocks that mimicked reefs. But the real breakthrough came in 2011 with the development of fabricated trees on which dozens of pieces of coral can be dangled from the branches.Backed by funding from the federal government and concerned donors, the foundation now has around 700 trees arranged in seven nurseries along the reef system as far as Ernest Hemingway’s old haunt of Key West.Retrieved fragments of wild coral are sliced into finger-sized pieces, sorted into genomic types and strung from the fibreglass and PVC trees, which are anchored to the seabed and buoyed with a float. Alongside the staghorn and elkhorn corals, swaying gently on lines in the currents, are boulder-covering corals that are mounted on nearby platforms.This environment lets the corals grow three times faster than normal. Even so, it takes up to nine months for them to reach the size of a small football, at which point they are taken to be attached to an appropriate reef using a special putty.Diversity is key, says Levy. While some other projects are experimenting with heat-resistant corals that can cope with occasionally warming waters, the foundation hopes a range of coral candidates will produce survivors. “We don’t want to put all our eggs in the heat tolerance basket,” she says.The aim is for the corals to take root, connect and spawn with each other. So far in 2018 more than 18,000 corals have been planted on to reefs, double that achieved annually five years ago. Around eight in 10 planted corals survive at least a year.This work is laborious and occasionally fraught. The trees need to be regularly cleaned of detritus, while around 300 coral genotypes across nine species must be sorted and tagged. Regrown coral can be swiftly wiped out by hot or cold snaps, storms or disease. Hurricane Irma stripped corals off the trees, although the structures themselves were almost all unscathed.“We lost a fair bit of stock with Irma,” says Levy. “This work can be very hard as well as very rewarding. You plant corals and watch them grow for several years and then something out of your control like bleaching can happen.“It just makes us go for the numbers – the more corals we get out there the more erse it will be and the better chance something is going to survive past the continued stress.”The largest of the nurseries, located three miles off the Key Largo coast, has around 500 trees, which look a bit like giant, antiquated TV aerials. Branching staghorn and elkhorn coral dangle from the trees just 10ft underwater.A constellation of marine life, such as trumpet fish, hog fish and trigger fish, flit between the trees. A nearby reef site is dotted with replanted corals bearing the tags of the Coral Restoration Foundation, although the overall coral coverage is scant.The bleak scene is completed by stands of lifeless pillar coral, ravaged by a bacterial disease that swept through the Keys last summer. A nearby brain coral is split by jagged white lines, further evidence of disease. The origins of many coral diseases are vague but at least one major outbreak has been linked to human faecal waste: the Keys only gained a fully functioning sewer system during the past decade. Recent research has found that these diseases will worsen as the oceans warm.The scale of the foundation’s task is “monumental”, says Cobb. But the restoration work could help provide a lifeline for reefs, she says.“Corals made it through the impact that killed the dinosaurs,” she says. “I believe some corals will limp through, the question is how much will be left. There is important work that holds real promise. There won’t be just one solution but a whole basket of them, some of which we can only guess at.”Another form of reef renovation has been taking place in the Bahamas, where scientists have been collecting material from mass spawning events – when corals release plumes of sperm and eggs into the water en masse – to help produce more numerous, stronger offspring for replanting.“We’ve had pretty good results,” says Joseph Pollock, coral strategy director for the Caribbean ision of the Nature Conservancy. He worked on a recent spawning event off Cape Eleuthera that has resulted in more than one million coral larvae. “This in itself is not a solution, it’s part of a suite of tools that can be used. If you’re not working on stressors from climate change down to coastal pollution, you may as well not be doing this work.”Back in Florida, the Coral Restoration Foundation is training a new batch of interns, who will help in educational outreach efforts with the public. At the foundation’s offices, fibreglass trees are being scrubbed clean and plans made to survey a nursery site as the skies clear from a tropical storm. The work, much like the morphing climate conditions ranged against it, seems endless.“I’m not ready to give up,” says Levy. “No one wants these reefs to die on their watch, so I would rather do something then sit back and watch everything die.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99e7cda19418bbe71712f2e6a459ab3010ce40d3/465_1034_7119_4272/master/7119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f98ad254e76adcb685712a8a10aa71a","title":"felicity cloake masterclass how to make falafel","story":"Crisp on the outside and fluffy within, a freshly cooked falafel is a world away from any shop-bought versionIf you’ve never eaten these wildly popular Middle Eastern fritters hot from the fryer, there’s a good argument that you’ve never really eaten falafel at all. Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy within, and made from nutty pulses generously spiked with fresh herbs, a freshly cooked falafel is a world away from its chilly, doughy, high-street cousin.200g split skinless fava beans (see steps 1 and 2)100g dried chickpeas5 spring onions4 garlic cloves, peeled1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley1 big bunch coriander1 tsp ground cumin1 tsp ground coriander1½ tsp Lebanese seven-spice (or ½ tsp ground black pepper and ¼ tsp each ground cinnamon, ginger, allspice and nutmeg)1 tsp saltSunflower or vegetable oil, for frying½ tsp baking powder4 tbsp sesame seedsThough they tend to be made with chickpeas in much of the Middle East, in Egypt, where falafel is said to have originated, they favour dried broad beans, giving them a smoother, softer consistency. I favour a Lebanese-style mixture of the two, using the beans as a binder and the chickpeas to add texture and flavour.Dried fava beans are easily found in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean grocers and wholefood shops, and even more easily online, where you can even source British-grown beans from the Norfolk-based Hodmedods: go for ready-shelled split versions, if possible, to save yourself a fiddly, if very simple job. Interesting fact: fava beans have been grown here since the Iron Age.Put the fava beans and chickpeas in separate bowls and cover both generously with cold water. Leave to soak overnight, or for about eight to 12 hours (if you need to leave them longer, refrigerate the bowls so the pulses don’t start to ferment), then drain, again keeping the two separate. Tip on to clean tea towels and roughly dry.Put all the beans and about half of the chickpeas into a food processor and pulse until fairly smooth: remember, they’re still raw and crunchy, so don’t push your machine too hard by leaving it running continuously. If you don’t have a food processor, improvise with a potato masher, pestle and mortar or a fork – and a lot of elbow grease.Finely slice the spring onions and crush or mince the garlic. Remove the coarse stems from the parsley, then roughly chop the leaves along with the coriander (you can leave the stalks on the latter, unless they’re very dirty). Add to the food processor with the spices, salt and remaining chickpeas, and whizz or mix just to roughly combine: the mixture should still be lumpy.Heat a dash of oil in a small pan over a medium-high heat and fry a teaspoon of the mixture until crisp leave to cool a little, then taste for seasoning and adjust as necessary. Stir in the baking powder (this will make the falafel extra-fluffy), then chill the mixture for at least 30 minutes – this will make it easier to shape.Wet your hands, then roll dessert spoons of the mixture into small, flattish balls or ovals about 5-6cm across. Pour the sesame seeds on to a plate and roll the balls across them until lightly coated. Fill a heavy-based, deep pan about a third full of oil and heat to about 180C (or use a deep-fat fryer to do the same).Fry the falafel in batches until crisp and golden (about five minutes), turning once, then drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with a little salt. Keep the cooked falafel warm in a low oven while you repeat with the rest of the mix, then serve as quickly as possible in flatbreads with crunchy salad, and preferably some pickles and tahini sauce (see step 9).To make tahini sauce, blend 75g light tahini paste with a crushed clove of garlic, the juice of half a lemon, and just enough water to give it a pourable consistency. Season to taste you may also like to add more garlic or lemon juice, if you think it needs it. This sauce keeps well in the fridge, so you can make it in advance, if you like."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/342b62dc64404ee891d5bb74ae692327fd6f8cd2/0_159_3699_2219/master/3699.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f21ddf81a77f73296de3d350e3d3449","title":"atletico madrid dump manchester city out of womens champions league","story":"Manchester City, twice semi-finalists in this competition, crashed out of the Champions League in the last 32 after a 2-0 home defeat by Atlético Madrid.There was hope in the air at the Academy Stadium before kick-off. City had travelled to Madrid and scored against the Spanish champions, it took an 89th-minute equaliser from Kenti Robles for the home side to salvage a point despite a strong performance.In Manchester it was a different story. Atlético, unbeaten in the Primera Division three games in, came out on a mission. Having come from two goals behind against Athletic Club on Saturday to win 4-2, the Spanish champions had found their grit.Atlético instantly started to trouble City, who have struggled in the league with five points from three games, and took the lead four minutes in when Ludmila da Silva broke free of Abbie McManus, teased the ball across the face of goal and with the City captain, Steph Houghton, leaving it to roll, Silvia Meseguer was at the back post to tap home.With Atlético taking the aggregate advantage for the first time in the tie, they started to turn the screw. Pressing hard they cut off City options and were able to intercept the obvious pass time and time again. With Keira Walsh and Jill Scott struggling to assert themselves in midfield, City’s brightest play came through Georgia Stanway and Lauren Hemp who combined on the left to try and carve out some space.It took more than 20 minutes for City to have their first chance, Stanway picking up the ball on the left and hitting a fierce drive that Gallardo did well, at full stretch, to tip the ball on to the crossbar and over.With City growing into the game a little and half-time looming, Atlético then dealt a critical blow, Da Silva racing through the middle, leaving Houghton in her wake, and powering the ball past Karen Bardsley for a well deserved second.With nothing to lose City threw caution to the wind in the second half, three changes before the hour saw the experienced heads of Tessa Wullaert, Nadia Nadim and Caroline Weir enter the fray. However, despite Nadim’s clever chips and the energy of Parris, Stanway and Hemp, Atlético’s disciplined back line and Gallardo were rarely troubled – another long‑distance Stanway strike from the edge of the box, a Jen Beattie headed effort from a corner, ruled offside, and then an injury-time effort from Weir that rattled the crossbar their best chances of the second half.In London, handed a much kinder tie, Chelsea put six past Sarajevo to secure their passage to the last 16 with an 11-0 aggregate triumph. An early opening goal from Drew Spence, two from Fran Kirby, the first her 50th for Chelsea, a free-kick from Maren Mjelde and late strikes from Hannah Blundell and Erin Cuthbert were added to the five they scored in the first leg in Bosnia-Herzegovina."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79dbd28c374b3fc36df86bd8302d4f27eda2aa9a/0_214_3230_1938/master/3230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=363ba60cbd5e7d041c2eb095e1f1096b","title":"gareth southgate new contract england manager 2022","story":"• Proposal to go before FA board on Thursday• Southgate offered significant pay riseGareth Southgate is set to agree a new four-year contract on improved terms to stay as England’s manager to the end of the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar.The proposed deal will be put before the Football Association’s board on Thursday and, with the national side having achieved a fourth-place finish in Russia in the summer, is likely to be ratified without any issues.Southgate had been relaxed about his contract situation – his deal is due to expire after the 2020 European Championship – and although he has made no secret of his desire to return to club management at some stage he is expected to sign the new terms.The FA has moved swiftly after losing its technical director, Dan Ashworth, who has worked closely with Southgate at St George’s Park over the latter’s two-year tenure, to Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion. Ashworth tendered his resignation day and will take up his new position early next year.With that in mind, the governing body has moved to secure Southgate on terms that would increase his basic annual pay, believed to be around £1.8m, to nearer £3m. The assistant manager, Steve Holland, is expected to join him by securing new terms.England’s Nations League campaign began this month with a defeat by Spain, and they face difficult trips to Croatia and Spain in October, by which point the FA will hope to have its manager under new contract.Southgate’s presence beyond 2020 would maintain continuity while a group of talented young players, who have made their mark in the England junior teams, potentially progress to the senior set-up. The FA has long targeted the 2022 World Cup as a tournament when its brightest young prospects will be at their peak.Ashworth will give the FA input over his successor as technical director as he works out his notice period. “Do I think we’re capable of winning something in the next two, four, six or eight years?” Ashworth said. “I certainly believe we have the talent in coaches, players and staff in place, yes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/193722d704364a3a2d5062df8a2d86544f1e56f7/0_192_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ed3a5fbead24aa3680964d3541cc1b9","title":"liverpool chelsea carabao cup match report","story":"Jürgen Klopp found faults with Chelsea’s equalising goal at Anfield that VAR could not. For the moment that brought Liverpool’s winning streak to an end, however, there could be only admiration. “Eden Hazard at full speed in the box is not easy to stop,” said the Liverpool manager. “A wonderful goal.” Chelsea reaped the benefits of the Belgium forward’s brilliant intervention.The first instalment of Chelsea’s double-header with Liverpool may lack the significance of Saturday’s Premier League meeting at Stamford Bridge but the value of victory will not be lost on Maurizio Sarri. His team kept their nerve and belief against the league leaders before securing a place in the Carabao Cup fourth round with a devastating late flourish. Hazard sealed the win in the 85th minute, beating four Liverpool players in a mesmerising run before finding the far corner of Simon Mignolet’s net.“Eden is one of the best players in Europe, one of the best in the world for sure,” said assistant manager Gianfranco Zola, taking over media duties from Sarri. “What he has done tonight is proof of that. He is doing the right things at the right moment. He is getting better and better.”For Liverpool, recognition of the flash of genius that condemned them to defeat was laced with frustration at a missed opportunity. Klopp made eight changes and was clearly unhappy with Xherdan Shaqiri after the final whistle, exchanging words over his use of a stoppage-time free-kick, but this was not a glaring example of fringe players failing to deliver.Liverpool created enough chances to have won but either squandered them or found Chelsea’s No2 goalkeeper Willy Caballero blocking their path. And not for the first time in the League Cup. Without Virgil van Dijk and Alisson they simply lacked the defensive authority to repel a team of Chelsea’s quality and Hazard’s excellence. It was a return to the suspect foundations of last year and a heavy price was paid.The visitors started confidently with Ross Barkley and Mateo Kovacic prominent in central midfield. Liverpool, once they “got used to Chelsea’s specific style of play”, according to Klopp, finished the first half the more threatening side and Caballero saved impressively from Naby Keita and Sadio Mané. The referee and VAR were also unmoved by three Liverpool penalty claims against Cesc Fàbregas, twice for handball, and Gary Cahill.Chelsea almost imploded after the restart. First Andreas Christensen undercooked an attempted back-pass to his goalkeeper. Daniel Sturridge seized on the mistake and rounded the keeper, who managed to get a hand on the ball but not enough power to push it clear. The goal was gaping but Sturridge, perhaps unaware he still had time and space, skewed a first time shot badly wide. A careless header from Barkley then freed Mané inside the Chelsea penalty area but Caballero again reprieved his team.Pressure was mounting on the Chelsea goal, however, and the introduction of Hazard for Willian could not alleviate it initially.The breakthrough was in keeping with the visitors’ start to the second half. Fábregas and César Azpilicueta both failed to clear their lines on the edge of the penalty area and the right-back gifted possession to Mané. The Liverpool striker released Keita on the angle of the box and though Caballero parried the midfielder’s shot the ball dropped invitingly for the unmarked Sturridge. It was not a simple chance but the striker made it appear so, leaping into the air before sweeping a left-footed volley into an unguarded net.The goal was Sturridge’s ninth in his last nine League Cup outings but Chelsea struck back emphatically. Sarri’s side had barely tested Mignolet in the second half but took full advantage of a dangerous free-kick awarded for a foul by Keita on Victor Moses. The referee’s assistant had awarded a throw-in. Hazard’s delivery was met by a glancing header from Barkley and though Mignolet saved well, Emerson beat substitute Roberto Firmino to the rebound to equalise from two yards out. The goal was allowed to stand following a VAR review that showed Álvaro Morata and Azpilicueta in offside positions but not directly involved in the goal.“I don’t think it’s a foul,” said Klopp. “Then you have two players that are clearly offside and they block. They don’t touch the ball but they block my players. That means a big impact in the situation. Why do you use VAR if you don’t want to make the decision?”There was no questioning the validity or brilliance of Chelsea’s winner. Two minutes after Sturridge had rattled the crossbar, Hazard took possession in central midfield. He spun away from Jordan Henderson and the debutant Fabinho before finding Azpilicueta on the right wing. Reclaiming the ball, the Belgian then beat Keita, twisted Alberto Moreno inside and out and drove an angled shot beyond Mignolet into the far corner. A superb finish worthy of winning any game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b832e9a4eeedfd840d832960572dc2ac8de35cbb/0_81_1358_815/master/1358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72603bb3233768bbac6a49ad63468e52","title":"spurs watford carabao cup match report","story":"Tottenham’s decision to stage this tie in Milton Keynes may not have been universally popular but the makeshift hosts sure delivered drama, complete with an ending that unfolded as if scripted by Dele Alli himself.On his return to his home town, and the ground where he began his career before leaving to become a bright light at Spurs three years ago, Alli wore the captain’s armband and scored twice from the penalty spot, including the decisive strike in the shootout.“He was inspired by the occasion,” said Mauricio Pochettino. “He was so excited beforehand, his energy was amazing. For him it was an experience that he will remember for all of his life. To be Tottenham captain and score two goals! I gave him the armband because he was so excited about playing in his home town and I wanted to provide him with a very good feeling. I hope he appreciated the gesture.”It took several twists for the tie to reach its remarkable denouement after a start that was misleadingly dull. After a humdrum first half Isaac Success put Tottenham’s mission on course for failure by scoring within 40 seconds of the restart.It was an excellent goal by the Nigerian, whose Watford career has been hampered by injury since he joined them two years ago. There was no sign of that when he collected a pass from Kiko Femenía before showing tremendous strength to shrug off Serge Aurier and wallop a shot into the net from 12 yards.Spurs gradually found intensity and began to apply heavy pressure, Pochettino showing his determination to progress in this tournament by making a trio of substitutions after starting with a lineup that included eight alterations to the side who began against Brighton in the Premier League. Javi Gracia had made even more changes, with Craig Cathcart the only survivor from the lineup that has started all six of Watford’s league games this season. But Watford, too, were eager to advance and Gracia introduced Christian Kabasele from the bench in the 77th minute to help protect their lead.Three minutes later the Belgian was on his way back off again, shown a red card after his challenge led to Alli tumbling to the floor. Alli got up to score from the penalty spot. Gracia was dismayed by the sending off – “I cannot understand this decision,” he said, before indicating that Watford would appeal against it.Tottenham did not enjoy a numerical advantage for long, however, as Aurier limped off with a quadriceps strain and Spurs could not replace him because they had already made three substitutions. That did not seem to matter when Érik Lamela put them 2-1 up in the 84th minute, rounding off a lightning counterattack by poking the ball into the net from the edge of the area as Heurelho Gomes rushed out to confront him.The story was not yet told. A former Spurs midfielder, Étienne Capoue, ratcheted up the suspense another notch in the last minute by scoring from 18 yards, albeit courtesy of a deflection off Ben Davies.Capoue then saw his spot-kick saved in the shootout by Paulo Gazzaniga, who also denied Domingos Quina, one of two 18-year-old midfielders featuring for Watford. That set the scene for Alli, the Milton Keynes native, to deliver victory and he did not miss his cue, firing low into the net. Home, sweet home for Alli. And the way the others Spurs players and fans celebrated suggested they did not care where this spectacle was taking place.Stadium MK was a little over two‑thirds full and although it felt incongruous at first – with Tottenham branding unable to conceal the giant MK Dons lettering exposed by empty seats – the atmosphere suggested the fans who turned up were keen to embrace the occasion, as well as to celebrate a local boy made good: Alli’s name drew a special cheer when read out before the game.“We could feel the love people here have for him and that was fantastic,” said Pochettino, who was in the mood to spread the love. “I want to say thank you to our fans on behalf of myself, the players, the staff and all the club. They came here to offer their support and made a massive effort. It’s important for us to show our gratitude. We also have to say thank you to Milton Keynes, the club and the town, because they welcomed us in a very good way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7135ba5c40d15ac3364caacbb4965a5eda7cee96/373_227_1614_968/master/1614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b294a00c770d88057ec902aba48bc34c","title":"jose mourinho scowl manchester united mood","story":"The bond the manager once was able to forge with players appears to have gone completely at Old Trafford, even if fans may still back him against a petulant Paul PogbaThe most startling thing, looking at José Mourinho, close-up, as he tried to pretend everything was still OK, were the dark rings beneath his eyes. His stare was wild, the eyes rheumier than we have seen them before. He looked, frankly, as if he needed a good night’s sleep. Sam Allardyce once noted how David Moyes had aged 10 years at Manchester United and it is starting to seem as if the same could be said of the current manager.OK, it’s a football game, not a fashion parade, but if you remember the days when the younger Mourinho turned up looking so debonair, with his tailored suits and immaculately coiffured hair, it was quite something to see him, frazzled, in his blue hoodie and white T-shirt, looking more like a bloke from Gogglebox than the guy who once seemed to hold the keys to the football universe. Mourinho’s appearance always reveals his mood. He wanted to pick an argument with the Sky interviewer when there was no argument to be had. His post-match press conference was a no-show and that was strange, too, when he once made it his business to have the final word.But then a lot has changed since those days when Patrick Barclay, author of Mourinho: Anatomy of a Winner, wrote that the Special One – and he was special, if we go back to his first spell at Chelsea – “even had a nice scowl”, never mind the kind of smile that could melt ice. Mourinho had an indefinable quality that inspired curiosity. His bond with his players seemed impenetrable and that, in football, was rare. As Ian Wright once put it: “If another manager hugged his players they might be rigid, cringing, embarrassed. But you can see the camaraderie between him and the team. There is a deep respect there. You can see they really love him.”Love? Well, yes, that word didn’t feel too strong. It can just feel like a trick of the mind now Mourinho is at Old Trafford, falling out with Paul Pogba, sniping at various others and clearly thinking nothing of taking down a couple of new targets in the wake of losing against Derby County, 10 years out of the Premier League, in the Carabao Cup.Unfortunately for United, this is what he has become and no one could ever say that it is a nice scowl these days. When he was appointed at Old Trafford in May 2016 the club were warned that his then assistant, Rui Faria, usually brought trouble. As it was Faria never lived up to his reputation as the manager’s attack dog. Mourinho, on the other hand, was creating conflict almost from day one. His attitude, according to one senior source at Old Trafford, was that “everything was shit … the training ground was shit, the players were shit, the medical staff were shit, the food was shit, the stadium was shit, everything”.Mourinho’s level of dissatisfaction has shocked staff and made them wonder whether his fractious relationships with the players and press at Real Madrid, and then his second spell at Chelsea, changed him for the worse. Even the small things sometimes. At Madrid, when he was desperate to replace Sir Alex Ferguson, he once made the extraordinary claim that he subscribed to MUTV from Spain and made a point of staying in on Friday nights to watch Paddy Crerand’s show. Mourinho, it now transpires, gives MUTV the bare minimum and frequently shows the club’s in-house channel his least attractive traits.The bigger issue, of course, is what to do with Pogba but it would be wrong to categorise this as merely the story of a conflict between two of the more important people at Old Trafford – in one corner, the manager, with his trophy count and ego and diminishing reputation in the other corner, the club’s most expensive player, a World Cup winner, with his mind set on leaving for Barcelona, and an agent who doesn’t give a damn who he upsets.A story of that nature will always dominate headlines but the truth is the list of players who have grown weary of Mourinho, who resent his approach, the negativity and unpleasantness and feel disenchanted, goes much further. We have been here before with him: he wears his players down, he makes it a grind and, eventually, the players at the sharp end turn against him. The pattern of Mourinho’s career suggests it usually gets worse, not better.The latest television pictures from United’s training ground offer another glimpse into the deterioration in relations between manager and player and, if this were Ferguson’s time in charge, it is tempting to think Pogba would be quickly removed. Unfortunately for Mourinho, he does not hold that power at Old Trafford, where the people in charge have to balance supporting the manager with looking after the club after his probable exit. Pogba was named recently as the most marketable athlete in the world. He is 25, with his best years presumably ahead of him. The people at the top of Old Trafford don’t want to lose a player with these uncommon gifts – one who cost £89m – when all the time there is the suspicion that Mourinho, being the man he is, is unlikely to hang around too long. Mourinho cannot count on Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman.That, however, does not excuse Pogba when his attitude has been so patently wrong, when he cannot apparently be bothered to hang around to watch the final exchanges of the Derby game (leaving his seat at 2-1) and when he has been using his various interviews, drip by drip, to undermine the manager, twist the knife – call it what you will.On that front, Mourinho was perfectly entitled to take issue with the player questioning the team’s tactics after Saturday’s draw against Wolves. Pogba did not criticise Mourinho directly but the message was clear, nonetheless, in a barely disguised, read-between-the-lines kind of way. It felt deliberate. It smacked of a player who knew he was blurring the lines and, ultimately, he is old enough and experienced enough to have known all this. And, as Ferguson used to say, the moment a player starts getting too full of himself, you’re in trouble.The upshot is that Pogba’s vice‑captaincy has been taken away, the bags under Mourinho’s eyes seem even more super-sized, and the pictures from Carrington seem to confirm what has already become clear: that they have tired of sharing each other’s oxygen, that the journalists who have been leading the way on this story are well briefed and that, given the status of these two iniduals at Old Trafford, it must be souring the entire atmosphere behind the scenes.The question is what happens next and, for now, no one can answer with great certainty. All that can really be said is Pogba might be in for a surprise if he assumes United’s match-going supporters are going to take his side. They have seen it all before, with David Beckham, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Wayne Rooney and others, and the crowd will always back the manager ahead of a mutinous player."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d243e9d3069524bfab6ccf37c01d4dcea10096bd/0_275_6274_3765/master/6274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4304fccd91bc5ede13383935231ecf13","title":"people here want to be lifted hampshire town is happiest uk place","story":"Rushmoor has highest feelings that the things done in life are worthwhile, ONS finds“If you can show me one person in Aldershot who’s happy, I’ll give you a free haircut,” promised Giovanni Gomma, a barber, in the centre of the Hampshire district that has been declared the happiest in the UK.Gomma, 61, who has run his Gomma’s Haircare salon on Station Road for 45 years, said the Office of National Statistics (ONS) – which revealed its findings on Wednesday – must have got its calculations wrong “or maybe the whole country isn’t very happy”.“If you walk around, you’ll see that this isn’t a very happy town, it’s a dying town,” said Gomma, who moved to Aldershot from Rome in 1973. “All the shops are shut, everyone shops online at Amazon, the atmosphere has gone.”Gomma’s personal analysis of the town’s contentment conflicts with the ONS’s annual happiness study, which assesses factors ranging from health to crime levels, anxiety and wellbeing. It found that the residents of the borough of Rushmoor – which includes the Hampshire towns of Aldershot and Farnborough – were the happiest in the country and also have the highest “feelings that the things done in life are worthwhile”.The 95,800 residents of Rushmoor were also, according to the ONS survey, the second-least anxious in the UK after Newry, Mourne and Down in the south-east of Northern Ireland.Rushmoor residents had average happiness levels ranked at 8.35 out of 10, compared with 7.7 for Britons on average – and much higher than the 6.7 recorded in Fenland in Cambridgeshire, which came bottom out of more than 400 local authority areas.Despite the gloom in Gomma’s empty salon, it did not take too long to find a happy Aldershot resident. Harka Gurung, a cashier at the amusement arcade next door, was “very, very happy to be Aldershot”. Gurung, 55, was part of the town’s large population of former Gurkhas and their families who settled in the town after retiring from the military.Gurung, who served in the army for 15 years, lived in the Aldershot garrison north of the town for three years before retiring to a small house with his wife in its large ex-Gurkha area nicknamed “Little Nepal”.“It’s a very nice life here in Aldershot,” Gurung said. “Most of the Gurkhas who leave the army stay here and many other Nepalese come here because of the community. My friends and family are happy, despite my wife’s sickness but the healthcare is very good.”Gurung, who has two grown up children (one serving with UK forces in Estonia and one in college), said the people of Aldershot may be happier because housing was more affordable than in other nearby towns in Hampshire and Surrey.Ken Muschamp, a Conservative councillor who is the deputy leader of Rushmoor borough council, said the sudden increase in the Nepalese population – after a 2008 court ruling gave Gurkhas who retired before 1997 and their descendants the right to settle in the UK – had once put a strain on public services. But he added that the ex-Gurkhas were an “important and vibrant part of our multicultural community”.Muschamp, 61, said he was “delighted and not totally surprised” to learn that his electorate were the most content in the UK. “We as a council have tried to do a lot to revitalise the area, which was hard hit when the army reduced the number of troops in Aldershot,” he said. “It hit businesses, there was suddenly a lot less troops with their disposable incomes.”A fair number of shops on Aldershot’s main streets have been boarded up – reflecting many small towns across the country. It lost its Woolworths in 2008 and Mark \u0026amp Spencer quit the town in 2015. On Wellington Street – the focus of the council’s regeneration scheme – Poundworld closed this summer when the budget retailer went bust.“I think people have seen that we are listening and investing £500m over 10 years to improve lives. Who would have thought the people of Rushmoor were worth half-a-billion? But they definitely are.“The people here want to get involved, they want to be lifted. They have pride in their community, and we want them to be able to have even more pride.”He said happiness could be lifted by “lower housing costs, and lower costs of living”, compared with surrounding areas.Muschamp said the borough also had some very high-paying jobs, particularly in Farnborough, which has developed an industrial park around Farnborough airport. BMW has its UK headquarters in the town, and Time Inc, the publisher of Marie Claire, NME and a dozen other magazines, has moved 300 jobs to the town’s business park."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a350c56d5ec5818c64ab12c2fbaf077dd7f3d84/0_0_4014_2408/master/4014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0cf8503c5ac78241465a8f7c4fcefed","title":"ecuador gave julian assange diplomatic role at its moscow embassy says mp","story":"WikiLeaks founder’s failed plot to leave the UK aided by minister, according to classified documentsEcuador went as far as appointing Julian Assange to a diplomatic position at its embassy in Moscow as part of its failed plan to get him out of the UK, the  has learned.The WikiLeaks founder was named as a councillor in Ecuador’s embassy to Russia on 19 December 2017, just days after he was granted Ecuadorean citizenship as part of the aborted escape plan revealed by the  last week. However, the nomination was later withdrawn after the UK refused to recognise his diplomat status.A classified document signed by Ecuador’s then-deputy foreign minister José Luis Jácome appeared to corroborate information from multiple sources that Russia would have been the ultimate destination for Assange if the plan had been successful.The involvement of Russia – a country from where Assange would not be at risk of extradition to the US – raised new questions about his ties to the Kremlin.Assange, who has not left Ecuador’s London embassy since seeking asylum there in August 2012, has been a key figure in the ongoing US criminal investigation into Russia’s attempts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.Classified documents, including the agreement to make Assange an adviser, have been seen by the Ecuadorean politician Paola Vintimilla, who will seek to have them declassified in a plenary session of Ecuador’s national assembly on Thursday.The stumbling block was the UK’s refusal to grant Assange diplomatic protection. Ecuador made two requests in the last week of December 2017, both of which the UK turned down, according to the documents.On 29 December, Ecuador withdrew Assange’s diplomatic appointment to Moscow. The operation to extract Assange was provisionally scheduled for Christmas Eve in 2017, one source told the .Vintimilla said another document lifted Assange’s asylum status – which would have been a first step to his appointment as an Ecuadorean diplomat. The agreement was signed on 4 December 2017 – a week before the Australian was granted Ecuadorean citizenship. It was signed and witnessed by the Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón, who has acted as a legal adviser to Assange.In May, Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, said that he had delegated all decisions about Assange to the then-foreign minister María Fernanda Espinosa, now the head of the United Nations general assembly. Moreno has previously described Assange’s situation as “a stone in his shoe”.“He washed his hands,” Vintimilla said, adding that Espinosa had bent the rules for Assange. Just days before Assange’s citizenship was granted, laws were changed to allow those living under the country’s international protection to obtain citizenship.Moreno, speaking on the sidelines of the UN general assembly on Wednesday, said that Ecuador and the UK were working on a legal solution that would allow Assange to leave the Ecuadorian embassy in London in “the medium term”. He gave no further details.The Russian embassy in London denied any involvement in an escape plan for Assange in a letter published in the  on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc67b1bad1716f6815a1168e2867cc8e9bb64564/0_99_3976_2386/master/3976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2484f8f24b07be9437a5f117439b556e","title":"bestival music festivals business bought for 11m","story":"Dorset entrepreneur James Benamor buys business days after it fell into administrationThe Bestival and Camp Bestival music festivals have been snapped up by a multi-millionaire Dorset entrepreneur just days after a collapse into administration.Richmond Group, controlled by the loan broker James Benamor, is buying the festival business after offering £1.1m for Bestival’s assets and brand. Richmond had lent Bestival Group £1.6m in February last year.Julie Palmer, of the advisory firm Begbies Traynor, who was appointed administrator on 20 September, said she had received more than one offer for the business but Richmond’s was the best bid.Bestival was launched in 2004 by DJ Rob Da Bank and this year was headlined by the performers Chaka Khan, Grace Jones and Thundercat.

I had expected Coxon to be a bit more taciturn, given his reputation as the second least chatty member of Blur. But earlier, as I waited outside, I heard him loudly, happily tootling a song to himself. As he vapes, he fizzes with enthusiasm, his body barely still for a second, even when he is trying to sit down and talk. “I can get quite stressed,” he says, shuffling in his seat, “but I’m in a good mood when I’m in the studio.”We are in London’s Konk Studios, near where Coxon lives, to talk about The End of the F***ing World, the Channel 4Netflix drama about two damaged teenagers falling in love, for which he wrote the gorgeous soundtrack. He abbreviates it to “The End of the World”, though, because he is around kids a lot, his own now being 18 and five. “The older one hears a few expletives every now and then, but I don’t swear that much any more. I just find it a bit grating. I’ve used every swear word under the sun but… ” He shrugs. “Who’s got the energy to be that het up that they’re going to use swear words? You need to be relaxing, not swearing. You need to be doing something else.”During the 1990s, when Britpop galloped through the mainstream, Coxon was a troubled soul: he has said that it was a “fraught” period. This led to some time in rehab and a seven-year separation from Blur. They were reconciled in 2009 for live shows and released an album, The Magic Whip, in 2015. Now 49, he has calmed down and grown up.“I was a self-centred, mardy brat for the majority of my 20s,” Coxon says, “because I saw everything as not being part of my plan. But I didn’t even really know what my plan was. I just wanted to be in the Who. But then suddenly it all seemed a bit fake. Everything seemed fake 60s: Union Jack guitars, the news, the Labour party. It was all a bit, um… ” He clicks his fingers. “What’s that chipboard covered with plastic? Melamine. It was all a bit like that. So I used to go to the pub and chat to painters and decorators, because I thought they were funnier, more entertaining and brighter than most people I met in the music industry.”These days, Coxon is more laid-back, even mellow. “I’m quite mellow,” he says, cautiously. He doesn’t smoke any more (vaping helped), he no longer drinks and he is “mostly” vegan, though he admits to a recent cheese relapse. He is at his happiest in the studio. “It’s a bit like a party all the time,” he says. “Not like a crazy party, not like sex, drugs and booze everywhere. It’s a nice party. Quite often, there’s a bowl of crisps. You get something for lunch and there’s chatting and music on. It’s quite like a party, isn’t it?”He is here “just working on some stuff”. The Magic Whip put his solo work on hold for a while, but he has been rehearsing for a tour in the US, where he will play alone, doing songs from the End of the F***ing World soundtrack and from 20 years of solo albums, and maybe a Blur track or two. “I’ll see if it works. I’m probably going to mess up loads,” he says. “Unfortunately, I couldn’t take a band with me, because the music industry is in such a terrible state. So I’m doing it on my own.”Since 1998, Coxon has released eight solo albums – nine, if you include this soundtrack. What keeps him at it? Is there more to say? “I feel there’s always more. Life isn’t long enough.” He sighs. “But I feel, also, what’s the point?” He regrets not doing more when he was younger, “like exploring lots of music I was really into and not feeling like I shouldn’t really do that, that I should stay in my little indie world”. Why did he feel that way? “I imagine it’s a lot of self-worth issues.”Coxon was at art school and barely 20 when Blur got together. “I was in a group before I could even play that well, so I didn’t have time to learn my craft, become a great blues player, be a shredder, be able to sit and go.” He twiddles an imaginary riff. “Not that I wanted to do that anyway. But I didn’t have time. I was in a group and I had to get on with it. So I learned in public, really. I’ve been quite slow. But I haven’t been in any rush. And I do feel there’s a lot to explore now. Maybe it’s too late. I’m 49.”We chat about the state of pop. He thinks it is too business-led, though he admits that it may have always been that way and that he has “turned the corner into that middle-aged world where it’s not that I don’t understand the music, it’s just that I can’t”. I wonder if he feels any nostalgia for the 90s, now there’s a bit of distance. Does he remember any excitement?“I was excited once I figured out where the good music was coming from,” he says. “And it was from America and from leftfield. Talking as a guitar player, Britpop for me was dull. It was fucking really dull. No one was doing anything interesting with a guitar. Of course, Jonny Greenwood was, Radiohead, but for the majority of it, it was just drongos who were there to back up a female vocalist.”They were labelled “sleeperblokes” by the music press. “They’re all jolly nice and totally good on their instruments,” says Coxon, “but it became a thing and it was very, very boring. For me, people like Sonic Youth, Bikini Kill, Pavement and other small-label punk groups from America – these kids were teenagers, they were playing like they didn’t give a shit and like their life depended on it.”Coxon’s American influences were all the more incongruous in the years when music magazines were stoking a rivalry between Britpop and grunge. “That was bullshit, really,” he says. “I didn’t understand that. That’s why I got so upset, because that should have been a time for me to be like, wow, brilliant. There was a particular kind of proto-grunge punk rock, with people like the Melvins and the Wipers, and these bands are brilliant unsung heroes, really.”What he loved about the sounds they made, he says, was how expressive they were, how that spoke to his shyness. “I liked it being expressive. I needed the guitar to be that tall for me, because I couldn’t do it in any other way. That’s why I used Blur live gigs, quite often, to get a lot out of my system and be a lot noisier than the records probably.”It is easy to forget that, during that time, Blur were boyband-famous. “We were presented that way, yeah,” he says. “Our label thought, ‘Oh, good-looking boys, get ’em in Smash Hits.’ They’d put tons of makeup on you, brush your eyebrows up so you looked totally mad, and make you smile and put pretty T-shirts on you.”But being that kind of spectacle wasn’t in his nature. “I felt horrible. I felt hideous,” he says. “But I thought, ‘That’s just what you do’. I didn’t feel comfortable with it, but I didn’t feel comfortable if it was just nice and moody black-and-white photography, either, in some groovy newspaper.”Was there any point at which he did feel comfortable? “I never felt comfortable. I’d be OK playing live. And I was quite comfortable after quite a few drinks. But that was the only time. I’ve since learned that that’s because I’m a totally addictive person.” He giggles. “And so of course, I’m never gonna feel anything other than less-than and anxious unless I was totally tanked up. But that’s a whole other thing, recognising that, doing something about it and growing up a little bit.”When Blur reunited in 2009, they were all “a lot more level”, he says. “It was like you could do all that again, but without all the pain. You can do it in a lovely way, with nice aeroplanes and in nice hotels, and people are gonna come and see you, and the audience is the same age as they were back then. I didn’t feel the need to be absolutely blasted all the time. In fact, I did it all sober, mostly. So it’s much better.”When asked about the possibility of another Blur album, Damon Albarn said recently that “a reunion is never not a possibility”. Coxon says that is exactly what he would say, too. “It’s just one of those things. When that moment comes around and we all want to do it, I don’t see why not.”For now, though, he is happy in the studio with his vintage microphones. “I haven’t really worked much,” he says with a smile. “So making music and going out and playing it with people, that’s my plan.” There is a point to all this then? “I mean, I could stop it and just get a job. I said this to someone the other day. They said, ‘But this is your job’. I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, guitar player is my job’. I like writing music, I like concepts. So I’ll just keep doing that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f055163a4ab7c5cb909ddac46fb3e1012c6209a/0_0_4946_2968/master/4946.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f88a0af1b7b1d2e33e7f37a72b427137","title":"mia and lily allen staying loud in a world that silences women","story":"In a thought-provoking documentary and a no-holds-barred memoir, these forceful music stars counter the ceaseless barrage of bile that has been directed their way since their debuts more than a decade ago. Have they just been unlucky, or are there more sinister forces at work? “The message to women – especially those whose voices might disturb the peace – has always been that things will go better for them if they keep their mouths shut,” writes author Rebecca Traister in a new essay. “And the best way to silence them is to ensure that their voices are considered illegitimate.” Traister was writing about the right’s treatment of two women who have accused supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Her words could equally apply to the picture that forms after reading new works of self-documentation by two female musicians: Lily Allen’s memoir, My Thoughts Exactly, and a documentary about the life of MIA, MatangiMayaMIA.What they do have in common is the gaslighting, humiliation and industry-scale punishment they have faced for being outspoken women with large platforms – and outspoken women who have often turned out to be right. MIA spent the first half of her career being called a terrorist and mocked, in the New York Times and on US television, for her attempts to highlight the plight of Sri Lankans in the country’s civil war. Two years after the war ended, the UN published a report stating that government forces had committed war crimes, slaughtering Tamils and accounting for the majority of civilian deaths in the war’s final phase. She was branded a “near humourless conspiracy theorist” for suggesting that the government controlled Facebook on her 2010 album MAYA, three years before the NSA files revealed that the US National Security Agency tapped directly into Facebook’s servers to track communications.Similarly incontrovertible patterns arise throughout Allen’s memoir. The tabloids somehow found out that Allen was pregnant before she was aware of the fact, stirring her suspicions four years prior to the News International phone-hacking scandal. When her first child was stillborn, doctors initially refused to believe her mother’s accurate suggestion that Allen had septicaemia. Police shredded the evidence she had gathered on a man she believed to be her stalker and suggested that when he broke into her flat, apparently concealing a knife, he was just a confused drunk on his way home. Yet in police interviews, he had said he wanted to put a knife through Allen’s face. He was eventually committed to a psychiatric institution.With the one-year anniversary of the #MeToo movement looming and, as Traister says, the collective force of women’s anger growing in power, MIA’s film and Allen’s memoir arrived at the optimum moment. Finally, they stand a long-awaited chance of being heard.A facile argument could pit them against one another, MIA as the voice of authenticity and Allen the shameless gentrifier, but their media treatment over the past 13 years has revealed the impossibility of existing as a woman in the public eye. Neither the privileged white woman nor the south Asian refugee is deemed sufficiently “authentic” to understand her own experience: “Don’t let MIA’s brown skin throw you off,” wrote Simon Reynolds in his review of her debut album for the Village Voice. “She’s got no more real connection with the favela funksters than Prince Harry.” He concluded that what was missing from Arular, despite its nods to grime, baile funk, reggaeton, was “local character – those telling details that transmit the true flava of a scene”.MIA was never trying to convince anyone of her musical authenticity. She couldn’t play an instrument. She couldn’t sing that well on her debut, let alone play and sing. “But I’m gonna do something you could never copy and do,” she told Fader in 2004. “That’s the philosophy of MIA – cut and paste and bish and bosh.” Arular wasn’t about contriving an intimacy with the cultures it plundered, but celebrating the borderlessness of culture in the young internet age – something that white critics such as Reynolds couldn’t conceive of a brown woman doing, preferring them to remain monocultural and exoticised. “We wanted more colour, more culture, more liberalism and we wanted more celebrations,” MIA told Rolling Stone in a 10th anniversary retrospective.Perhaps they were both “an embrace of the multiculturalism that came out of the end of Tony Blair’s New Labour government,” as critic Simran Hans writes of MIA in Dazed: this is what Allen did on Alright, Still. Its culture-clash seems commonplace now, but in 2006, the New York Times described her as “one of the oddest female artists to emerge in years”, noting: “She is obsessed with black music, from rock-steady to Jay-Z, but she seems blithely unconcerned with issues of authenticity and appropriation.” Though that wasn’t the aspect of Allen’s identity that most confused them: “She looks so traditionally feminine that her foul mouth and bellicose nature are amusing surprises,” they wrote, prudishly.Neither artist was trying to convince anyone of the authenticity of their own experience. Both were caught between identities, forced to take responsibility for themselves: the daughter of apparent privilege whose parents were barely ever around the refugee who hadn’t seen enough of the war to fit in with her family back in Sri Lanka and was called “Paki” by racists on the street in her new home in south-west London. Admittedly, one of these calls for a smaller violin than the other. Yet in a textbook example of the way women are held accountable for men’s actions, neither MIA nor Allen has been able to escape their father’s shadow, even as they have agitated for their own causes. “Terrorist” and “champagne socialist” are fairly disparate reputations, but MIA’s situation reveals the impossibility of both.And yet, the media behaved as if MIA was the one responsible for invalidating her cause when she became successful (further revealing the lie of the “good immigrant” promise) and had a child with a billionaire, Benjamin Bronfman, to whom she was briefly engaged. A 2009 New York Times Magazine profile painted MIA as a dilettante, implying that she couldn’t be an outsider because she was eating truffle fries during their interview (which, it turned out in the aftermath, journalist Lynn Hirschberg had ordered). Hirschberg – who fawns over MIA in the documentary – called in Sri Lankan experts and human rights organisations, plus the musician’s producer ex-boyfriend Diplo, to undermine MIA. Hirschberg dismissed her activism as “radical chic”, the term Tom Wolfe coined to skewer the fashionability of bourgeois politics in 1970.This is fair criticism – both artists’ personal complaints betrayed a misunderstanding of structural injustice. But the tabloid and rightwing media, always acting in bad faith, also wielded the opposite tactic, reducing Allen and MIA’s arguments about structural injustice to petulance and – that distinctly feminine crime – self-promotion. What point could MIA possibly have been trying to make when she released the video to Born Free, in which a parade of ginger-haired boys are killed in a genocide? (Even the 12-year-old lead could grasp it: “I think she was trying to show violence to end violence,” Ian Hamrick told TMZ, this apparently being enough of an issue for a celebrity gossip website to stalk an unknown child actor.) How dare Allen cry when visiting the refugee camps in Calais, or amplify the north Kensington community’s suspicion that the Grenfell death toll was far higher than the official reports?The climax of MIA’s documentary is the perfect example of how making a point about injustice can be spun as a greater offence than the injustice itself in order to silence women. At the 2010 Super Bowl, she flipped off the cameras while performing with Madonna. The gesture seemed impetuous – she initially claimed it as a spiritual gesture in tribute to her namesake, the Hindu goddess Matangi – but she later explained that she felt sickened by men telling the most successful living female pop artist to twirl and bend over (sexualised behaviour for which Madonna is often dragged in the press). The NFL attempted to sue MIA for £10m a parade of white-bread American pundits clutched their pearls on national TV. This sequence is one of the funniest, yet most horrifying, moments in the film.The incident drew more attention than the Sri Lankan civil war had ever received in the US media. “A brown person who is standing up there and not sucking dick is more offensive than murdering someone,” MIA says in the film. Never mind that behind her on the Super Bowl stage, teenage cheerleaders were being sexualised on national TV never mind the accusations one could level at the NFL: a woman had elicited mockery for her efforts to draw attention to civil conflict was now apparently powerful enough to poke out a star on Old Glory with a single brown finger.Allen and MIA have always intended to provoke. But Allen has said she no longer perceives success as a rebuke to the tabloids who wanted her to flop, and that being taken seriously as a musician (her fourth album, No Shame, was nominated for this year’s Mercury prize) is what fulfils her now. And MIA has batted away suggestions that now is the perfect time for her to make a new album, when Trump’s presidency has mainstreamed politicised art and her “conspiracy theories” about the government and social media have become more trenchant still following the Cambridge Analytica revelations. “Talk about Donald Trump or be angry about this – it’s okay, we’re happy with you being angry this time, we get it,” she told Dazed. “But I’m already over it, you know?” (She hasn’t stopped agitating: just last week she was lobbying Australian airlines to stop assisting with the forced deportation of asylum seekers.)My Thoughts Exactly and MatangiMayaMIA pose provocative questions about what is expected of famous women and the punishment that awaits them if they doesn’t conform to the docile sexuality, the benign platitudes, the immaculate consistency of thought and identity that is impossible for any functioning human being bar rigid ideologues – especially for women who have grown up in the public eye, caught between media distortion and their own maturity. Allen and MIA triumph lies in their unwillingness to flatten their identities to make themselves more palatable. They are musicians, single mothers, survivors of polarised yet turbulent childhoods and the tabloid media at its most vicious and puritanical.In 2015, a wave of memoirs by older female musicians including Viv Albertine, Kim Gordon and Chrissie Hynde were greeted as welcome correctives to male-dominated rock history. Allen’s book and MIA’s film show exactly how anti-woman narratives are still being cemented in real time, and reveal how endurance might yield small vindications.

There was no mention, however, of the section of the poem which predicts that “when the trumpets ring  The thrust of a poor man’s arm will go  Through the heart of the proudest king”.It is not as if Percy Bysshe Shelley, also quoted by Corbyn in his Liverpool address, was the ideal husband and father either. The celebrated Romantic poet, Corbyn noted, had written a poem about the Peterloo massacre, which happened 200 years ago next year, in which at least 15 people were killed at a peaceful demonstration in Manchester. Two of them, bizarrely, have almost identical names to two of Corbyn’s front bench – the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, from health, and Sarah Jones, shadow housing minister.Shelley’s poem The Mask of Anarchy was the source of the party’s slogan “for the many, not the few”, Corbyn said, though the poet’s rhetoric (“Rise like Lions after slumber In unvanquishable number  Shake your chains to earth like dew”) is arguably more forceful than anything the Labour leader has yet mustered on the campaign trail.But Corbyn, whose first speech as Labour leader drew on writers Maya Angelou and Ben Okri, took most satisfaction in quoting a political opponent, the former Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O’Neill.Lord O’Neill, who was appointed as a Treasury minister by David Cameron, told the Times earlier this month that Labour had “captured the mood of the times”. “Let me say to his Lordship: you’re welcome,” said Corbyn. “Come and join us in the new political mainstream.” If only it had been so easy for the Chartists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42a5ceb3d7813f0ba4e60641bd25f7a42cd7ef76/0_72_2650_1590/master/2650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4baef102fb9af711f09aadc714808003","title":"jeremy corbyn labour conference speech brexit chequers plan election","story":"Labour leader adds to pressure on PM in conference speech that skewered Chequers planJeremy Corbyn has told Theresa May that Labour MPs will vote against her Chequers plan unless she is willing to accept his proposal to keep Britain in a customs union and protect consumer standards and workers’ rights after Brexit.The conditional offer came near the end of an hour-long speech at the Labour party conference in Liverpool, in which Corbyn tried to position himself as sitting in the mainstream of British politics, three years after he took control of the party.The Labour leader told delegates: “As it stands, Labour will vote against the Chequers plan – or whatever is left of it – and oppose leaving the EU with no deal” in the meaningful final vote promised by May after the Brexit talks conclude in November.But he held out the possibility of supporting May – who is struggling to contain a rebellion against her Chequers plan from the right wing of her party – on his terms.“If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people’s rights at work and environmental and consumer standards, then we will support that sensible deal. A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too,” he told delegates.Corbyn concluded: “But if you can’t negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can.” That prompted the loudest applause in his fourth keynote address as party leader, in which he argued that since the 2008 financial crash his brand of politics was what the country needed.The leader highlighted policy ideas unveiled by party colleagues, such as worker representation on company boards, taxation of second homes and reversing cuts to council services and police numbers. He also made pledges on childcare and vowed to maintain the triple-lock on the state pension in a bid to appeal to older voters.“Conference, we are winning the public debate. We have defined the new common sense, and that’s where our party can stand united,” Corbyn said.That, he said, explained the party’s relative success in the 2017 election, in which Labour gained dozens of seats and denied May control of the Commons. “That’s why Labour speaks for the new majority, why last year we won the biggest increase in the Labour vote since 1945, and why Labour’s ideas have caught the mood of our time.”Corbyn’s carefully crafted statements on Brexit came at the end of a party conference that has been largely dominated by the European question, and in particular whether to support the idea of a second referendum following intense pressure from the party’s membership.Delegates had supported a motion to keep open the option of campaigning for a second referendum if it cannot force a general election over the issue, but the compromise appeared to come unstuck when the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, seemed to contradict one another over whether remain should be an option on the ballot paper.The Labour leader, however, stepped back from that debate as he focused his attack on May’s tortuous negotiations with Brussels. He said leaving the EU without a deal would be “a national disaster”, adding: “If parliament votes down a Tory deal or the government fails to reach any deal at all we would press for a general election.”Referring obliquely to a second referendum, Corbyn added: “Failing that, all options are on the table.”Corbyn’s declaration increases the chance of May not being able to get a final Brexit deal through parliament, given that the European Research Group faction in the Conservative party has repeatedly said it would also vote against Chequers.The party leader accused May of being increasingly in hock to the her party’s right, saying that the main negotiations had been between “different factions of the Tory party”. He said that May and other cabinet ministers “see Brexit as their opportunity to impose a free market shock-doctrine in Britain” and cited the prime minister’s pledge made on Tuesday in a speech in the US to cut corporation tax to the lowest level in the G20.On Thursday, Corbyn will meet the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to explain his party’s opposition at a time when European commission officials are increasingly concerned that the UK will be unable to agree a final deal, making them fear a no-deal Brexit is more likely.May’s Chequers proposals would keep the UK signed to a common rulebook of standards for food and goods after the country leaves the EU. May has repeatedly defended the scheme, although the European commission has said it will come back with its own counter-proposals next month as Brexit talks reach their final phase.The speech contained few new policy pledges, instead citing announcements made by frontbench colleagues throughout conference although Corbyn did, as had been trailed, promise a green energy policy he said would create 400,000 new jobs by 2030 and pledge that Labour would make 30 hours a week of free childcare available all two-, three- and four-year-olds.Corbyn also referred to antisemitism, conceding the row over the issue had “caused immense hurt and anxiety in the Jewish community and great dismay in the Labour party”. He said he hoped it would be possible for the party “to draw a line” under the issue a month after the party adopted the full definition of antisemitism for its internal code of conduct as drawn up by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.He declared: “We will work with Jewish communities to eradicate antisemitism, both from our party and wider society. And with your help I will fight for that with every breath I possess,” and, reverting to first principles, added: “Anti-racism is integral to our very being. It’s part of who you all are, and it’s part of who I am”.The leader did not reference any of the controversies about his own conduct and he did not make the unconditional apology the former chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks had called for after audio emerged of Corbyn accusing a group of British Zionists of being unable to understand English irony.But Corbyn did attack the Conservatives, and accused the governing party of double standards. “We won’t accept it when we’re attacked by Tory hypocrites who accuse us of antisemitism one day, then endorse Viktor Orbán’s hard-right government the next. Or when they say we are racist, while they work to create a hostile environment for all migrant communities.”He said race hate was a growing threat in Britain, Europe and the US that had to be confronted and said a rising far right was on the rise “on the rise, blaming minorities, Jews, Muslims and migrants, for the failures of a broken economic system”.Corbyn also appeared to accuse Theresa May of pursuing a similar approach. “Its victims include the Windrush generation who helped rebuild Britain after the war and were thrown under the bus by a government that reckoned there were votes to be had by pandering to prejudice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c03dc6b9cdd6612fdc4cd29fd4f465d5e71bcbc/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=27d9c29e70162b583fb1aabbcb0b3fb0 1760w","title":"france out make most ryder cup chance legacy","story":"Biennial tournament is taking place in mainland Europe for only the second time and French organisers are determined to create a legacy for a golf-indifferent countryYou know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in Paris? Le burger 2018. At least, that is what they call it in the distant little quarter that has been taken over by the Ryder Cup this week. It is, Quentin Tarantino wrote, the little differences. Such as the hot dogs, which are made with Toulouse sausages and, well, that is about it.This may be the first Ryder Cup in France but it looks and feels like every other, all scaffold grandstands and sponsored marquees. “Inside the fences it’s hard to do anything distinct,” says Pascal Grizot, the vice-president of the French Golf Federation. “But, you know, the French flavour is much more outside the fences.”Except “outside the fences” you would not necessarily know the competition is on. A plot in the 4th arrondissement outside the Hotel de Ville has been taken over by a spectator village but otherwise the city is just going about its everyday business.The French papers calls Grizot “Mr Ryder Cup”. It was his idea to bid for it in the first place, and he has spent the past decade doing the planning. Spain were the favourites to win the bid before the decision was made in 2011. It had already hosted it once, the only other time the tournament was held in mainland Europe, at Valderrama in 1997. Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands were all in the running, too. Grizot argues that the reason France beat them was precisely because of the sport’s lack of popularity. He says the French managed to argue: “We were the only country who wanted to host the Ryder Cup to grow the game.”“Spain’s was a great bid,” he says, “but it was really all for tourism reasons, and the same in Portugal, while for Holland the whole thing was supported by a group of very important businessmen. But in France we wanted to do it for the development of golf.”In the past few years the French federation has been running an education programme to get the game into schools and has also built 99 small urban courses. There are another 40 planned too. “These golf courses are simple and short,” Grizot says, “which means we’re addressing the two biggest criticisms of golf today – which are that it’s too expensive and too time-consuming.”Grizot’s word for it, “legacy”, is one all governing bodies love to hear and use. Keith Pelley, the European Tour’s chief executive, has said: “If we can use the Ryder Cup to grow it, to increase the engagement, the awareness of our game, then that is something critical.” So that was one reason to bring the Ryder Cup to France. Then there were another 18m. It has cost them around €43m to host, almost half of it the fee they had to pay to Ryder Cup Europe. Grizot raised a large part of it from the country’s 410,000 registered players, who agreed to pay a €3 fee annually for the last 13 years just to fund it.“Unfortunately it came from the UK,” he says. “It was the British who came to France and built the first golf courses. And the British people who had the opportunity to do this, well of course they were rich people, and they only wanted to play with rich people.” Grizot wants to change minds. “The Ryder Cup is so strong that it doesn’t just speak to golf fans, it speaks to all citizens. I’m not sure all the people who discover golf during that week will play golf but I’m quite sure that a lot of them will.”It would have helped if France had a player in the team. Victor Dubuisson played brilliantly well at Gleneagles in 2014. He is injured, with a perforated ear drum suffered after his flight back from the Spanish Open in April, but even before that happened he seemed almost to have fallen out of love with the sport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02a7fda8a518243f6d6f5d6ef4a3aad7d134027c/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91ee7dafc87fa0c66d8d8ac242c06314","title":"joe marler england retires internationa rugby","story":"• Decision by Harlequins player is bombshell for Eddie Jones• Dylan Hartley heartened by chat with Alastair CookJoe Marler has dropped a bombshell by retiring from England duty less than 12 months before the World Cup. The Harlequins prop has cited spending time with his young family as a key reason, stating he is unable to give all of himself to the England cause.The 28-year-old, who has won 59 caps, informed Eddie Jones of his intentions shortly before the England squad camp in Bristol this week before pulling out because of personal reasons and has played his last match for the national team.“It is an incredible commitment to play rugby for England and I strongly believe that if you are unable to give yourself fully to it then it is time to step away,” he said. “Otherwise it would not be fair on the team, or my family. Being with England you have to spend an incredible amount of time away and I could not do that any more.”Marler missed Jones’s first summer tour in charge of England – to Australia in 2016 – and later said he withdrew because of physical and mental exhaustion. He explained that he had been struggling to focus on his game after his £20,000 fine from World Rugby for his “Gipsy Boy” comment made to the Wales prop Samson Lee.His decision to now withdraw from England duty permanently is a huge blow for Jones, considering Marler’s experience and his reliability in providing back-up to Mako Vunipola, who has established himself as the first‑choice loosehead. Marler has made 23 appearances under the Australian and was part of the British \u0026amp Irish Lions tour of New Zealand in 2017. “Now is the time to walk away and get some new blood in the team. And I am looking forward to being able to give my wife and children more of my time,” he said. “I would like to thank everyone at England for the opportunities that I have been given. I will always be grateful for the memories playing for my country has given me.”In the short term, Jones’s loosehead options for the autumn internationals behind Vunipola are severely limited with Leicester’s Ellis Genge out with a shoulder injury. Alec Hepburn is another while his uncapped Exeter teammate Ben Moon was called into this week’s squad to replace Marler.Jones said: “Joe is a great player and team member so I am disappointed and we will miss him. But he has made his decision on personal grounds and we understand his reasoning. He’s a good guy – an honest, mature person who understands the demands of the game and the demands of family life. I have got to admire his honesty and the way he has gone about this.”Marler has been among the more vocal senior internationals to discuss the increasing demands on modern players and in April 2017, addressing plans to trim the duration of the Six Nations to six weeks, he told the : “If we lost a rest week – I think it’s ridiculous. If boys are playing 11 months and getting a four- or five‑week break their bodies, and mentally… it’s not that you’re bored but it’s like: ‘Christ, this is a slog now.’”During the Six Nations this year he was banned for England’s first two matches against Italy and Wales and talked of knuckling down because “I’m missing out on things I really want to be part of”. He has since had a change of heart and, like his fellow loosehead Alex Corbisiero, his England career comes to a premature end.Tiger Woods’s comeback may have grabbed more headlines but Dylan Hartley is trying his best to ensure a similar happy ending. With less than a year until the 2019 Rugby World Cup, England’s fit-again captain is determined to go to Japan as his country’s first-choice hooker and to make a significant Test return this autumn.Hartley has not played for England since mid-March, having taken an extended break to recover fully from concussion, and missed the summer tour series defeat in South Africa. He is now back playing club rugby again and a recent chat with the cricketer Alastair Cook, a Northampton Saints follower, has persuaded him there is still more he can achieve. The pair have spoken following Cook’s remarkable farewell performance against India at the Oval and it would appear Hartley has been suitably inspired.“I talked to him the other day,” the 32-year-old said. “Not about retirement, although naturally the conversation did head that way about him. Some of the things he said to me made me think I’m still in a good place professionally and with sport.”Hartley took nothing for granted at England’s training camp in Bristol this week. His team’s first autumn Test against the Springboks at Twickenham is barely five weeks away and the World Cup clock is starting to tick loudly. He believes his concussion problems are history.“I had six months between games and the advice, the research and the feeling I had was fine. A new perspective is always good. I’ve still got the desire to be involved in something good.” Robert Kitson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e34e776581d2b968685beea9acbca569c35f30/0_128_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbaf8c5455eadaffa7d5c98367ceed8a","title":"yorkshire road race world championships 2019","story":"The road race world championships in Yorkshire next year will tap directly into memories of the 2014 Tour de France’s Grand Départ with the flagship men’s elite race on 29 September. The climax of eight days’ racing will replicate the first stage of the Tour’s loop into the Yorkshire Dales national park for a large part of the 284.5km course starting in Leeds and finishing in Harrogate.Just as the Tour did five years earlier, the 2019 world championships will head north-west out of Leeds through Otley and Skipton to tackle the ascents of Buttertubs and Grinton Moor before heading back into Harrogate, the principal host town for the 11 races in eight days of competition for junior men and women, under-23 men and elite racers.As is now normal practice, the various races will start in towns across the region, but the series will for the first time incorporate four paralympic road races, on day one, 21 September, over a variety of distances on a course from Beverley to Harrogate. Day two will feature a novel mixed team time trial relay contested by national teams comprising three men and three women.The races will mostly start outside Harrogate: Ripon for the men’s under-23 and women’s time trials, Northallerton for the men’s elite time trial, Richmond for the men’s junior road race, Doncaster for the junior women’s and under-23 men’s road races, Bradford for the elite women – where it is hoped that the 2015 champion Lizzie Deignan will ride 12 months after the birth of her daughter Orla – and finally the elite men in Leeds.Twelve months after what is expected to be the hilliest world road race championship of the modern era in Innsbruck, the undulating 14km circuit in Harrogate on which most of the races will finish looks set to provide easier racing, where the world championships is as much a test of stamina and bike-handling rather than pure climbing ability.The Harrogate circuit will be based on 4km heading due west straight up the B6162 Otley Road, before an up-and-down return into the town centre, finishing in West Park, where the 2014 Tour’s opening stage ended. The final 4km includes eight bends in the town centre, with three turns in the final kilometre before the slightly uphill finish.22 September: team time trial mixed relay, Harrogate circuit23 September: men\u0027s and women’s junior inidual time trials, 14 and 28km, Harrogate circuit\u0026nbsp24 September: women’s elite and men’s under-23 inidual time trials, 32.5km Ripon-Harrogate\u0026nbsp25 September: men’s elite inidual time trial, 52.5km, Northallerton-Harrogate27 September: women’s junior and men’s under-23 road races, 91.5km and 192.5km, Doncaster-Harrogate\u0026nbspThe circuit will be key to the championships, as it is used to complete eight of the races, the exception being the junior women’s road races and the men’s elite time trial. The elite men will cover it seven times after their 180km loop through the Dales, while the women and under-23 men will take in three circuits.The climbs outside Harrogate come relatively early, so are unlikely to split the fields. That means the circuit will be technical and testing for a large peloton, particularly if the weather turns autumnal, as riders in the European championships in Glasgow in August found out when the men’s race proved particularly demanding in heavy rain and cold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48b225bcfd443ac0379797686538a15ac5605c49/94_0_3813_2288/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32b10a0a75dc634aff2715ae633a981a","title":"elders company theatre stage","story":"Most theatres run youth groups but Manchester’s Royal Exchange also has a company of amateur actors over 60. Its members discuss acting’s cruelty and camaraderie – and the joy of ‘not giving a toss’Train driver Joe Figueira loved drama at school but never considered it as a possible career. Now aged 62, he is a few months away from retirement and in a studio at Manchester’s Royal Exchange theatre, about to embark on a year of training with the organisation’s Elders Company – a theatre group for people over 60 with no professional theatrical experience.“I was looking for a new thing to do going into my retirement and a new way to stretch myself,” he says, as the new company of 25 people – the oldest of whom is 84 – mill around and chat over cups of tea. “I hadn’t done drama since I was 16 and I had a lot of trepidation about whether or not it would be my thing, but I’ve come here and I’m loving it.”While most theatres run youth groups to get schoolchildren on to their stages, the Royal Exchange is a growing number of organisations reaching out to older people. Leeds Playhouse, Southwark Playhouse in London and Theatre by the Lake in Keswick all run groups for over 60s to develop their performance skills and learn about theatre.“We are a growing and ageing population and we need to think about what provision there is for older people and how can we keep them active and creative for as long as possible,” says Andy Barry, who has run the Royal Exchange’s elders programme since it started in 2014.“It’s really important for people to keep being creative into their later years, not just for health and emotional wellbeing, but also because it makes for more artistically interesting work. As an artist, working with them has pushed my practice more than ever before.”Members of the company attend weekly two-hour sessions. This autumn, they will focus on voice and movement, with trust exercises, physical and vocal warmups, and breathing tasks. In spring, the group will study the work of Bertolt Brecht to coincide with the Royal Exchange production of Mother Courage. The company is also encouraged to audition for professional productions when the opportunity arises: members appeared in Sarah Frankcom’s 2017 production of Our Town by Thornton Wilder and in Bryony Shanahan’s production of Queens of the Coal Age by Maxine Peake this summer.Asked if he feels creative, Figueira hesitates. “When I come here to this space I do,” he says. “Not perhaps in my everyday life, but when you come in to this room it’s as if somebody has sprinkled some magic dust. You’re not afraid of making a fool of yourself because no one is going to judge you.”Above all, Figueira is hoping for the opportunity to tread the boards at the Royal Exchange. “If I could get on that stage, there wouldn’t be a happier person in this world,” he says. “Even if I was spear carrier number two or dead body number three, I wouldn’t care.”Elizabeth Aniteye, 65, a retired occupational health adviser who moved to the UK from Ghana at the age of 18, was in last year’s Elders Company, making her an “elder graduate”, which allows her to continue to stay involved with the creative work of the theatre.“As far back as I can remember, I’ve always been interested in drama and theatre,” she says. “When I was younger I wanted to be an actress, but my dad wouldn’t have it. He didn’t think it was a proper job. I always thought that when I got to a position where I could do it, I would. But with life and children and careers and so on, you don’t get enough time.”Older people are more creative, she says, as they are no longer worried about what people think of them. “When you’re younger, you’re worried about the way you look, what people say about you, whether you are making a fool of yourself, what society thinks. When you get to our age, you really do not give a toss.”Gordon Emerson, 73, is a retired plumber. He was also in the company last year, an experience that gave him the opportunity to perform at the Everyman theatre in Liverpool. “I keep pinching myself. It’s surreal really,” he says. Does he enjoy performing? “Yes, but it’s a knife edge. The adrenaline. My daughter says: ‘You put yourself through hell sometimes just for two minutes of applause.’”Despite discovering a surprising aptitude for theatre at such a late stage, Emerson has no regrets about the career he chose. “I’ve done it the right way around. I enjoyed my job. I brought a family up and this now is the icing on the cake,” he says. “It’s hell being an actor. It’s the cruellest of professions. I’m doing this in a very supportive atmosphere, so I think I got it the right way around.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b98078dbf15c3de4aa6cf96e3876f86da449532d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7230dc0ebd4614a5f185454290a9000a","title":"mystic messenger dating simulations sims digital intimacy","story":"A crop of dating simulations where the goal is to reach a virtual happily ever after have recently become hits. Are they a substitute for human companionship or a new type of digital intimacy? I recently met a young woman named Wild Rose on an online chat forum. We struck up a conversation and within the first five minutes, Wild Rose – who is married, has a daughter, and lives in Texas with her in-laws – started telling me about her lover, a man called Saeran.Saeran, she told me, is the illegitimate son of a politician who had grown up with an abusive mother. He is handsome, has white blond hair, golden eyes, a large tattoo on his shoulder. Wild Rose said that when she first met him, her “heart literally ached” and her cheeks “flooded with blood”.She then paused and added: “But I don’t think Saeran loves me the way I love him. I love him genuinely. I’ll never know his true feelings.”The reason: Saeran isn’t human. He is a character in a mobile phone game called Mystic Messenger, which was released two years ago by Cheritz, a South Korean game developer. It has since been downloaded by millions of people worldwide. The game is a mix between a romance novel and Spike Jonze’s 2013 movie Her, in which a man develops a relationship with a Siri-like character.The primary aim of Mystic Messenger is to pursue a romantic relationship with one of a number of characters in the game, one of whom is Saeran. To cultivate intimacy with these virtual beings, you talk to them via a text message. The responses are pre-scripted, but feel dynamic and sincere. Winning the game is not about scoring points or beating a final boss it is about reaching a “good ending” where you and your virtual lover live happily ever after.The idea of simulating romantic relationships through gaming is not unique to Mystic Messenger. This genre of game – often referred to as dating simulations or dating sims for short – emerged in the 1980s in Japan, where they were popular with a predominantly male audience. But since the rise of mobile and online gaming, dating sims have become popular outside Japan and with more erse demographics.In the past year, there has been a bumper crop of hit dating sims, including Love and Producer, Dream Daddy and Doki Doki Literature Club. Unlike earlier generations of dating sims, where the action centered on erotic interactions with virtual girls, these games foreground conversations between players and characters, and often have nuanced and well-developed scripts. Mystic Messenger is one of the most popular of this new generation dating sim.Since dating sims first came out, they have been controversial. In Japan, many critics saw the rise of dating sims as a signifier of alienation, a retreat from human relationships in a machine-mediated society. And as the popularity of dating sims develops once again, similar concerns are resurfacing. But the growing community of people who play dating sims are mostly impervious to this disapproval. The most dedicated romantic gamers do not see their interactions with virtual characters as a substitute for human companionship, but as a new type of digital intimacy.As well as spending hours playing dating sims, fans chat with each other on online forums about their favorite characters and the contours of their virtual relationships. It was on one of these forums that I met Wild Rose. I had joined hoping to get a better understanding of why people play these games and whether the relationships they form with virtual characters possibly foreshadow a future in which the boundaries between real and virtual companionship will become increasingly blurry, if not irrelevant.When I first asked Wild Rose to explain how and why she fell in love with Saeran, she told me that if I had any hope of understanding, I had to first enter the world of Mystic Messenger and experience it for myself.I started playing Mystic Messenger one weekend when I didn’t have much else on. In the game’s plot, I was a young woman who stumbled upon a private messaging app. There I met a group of hyper-realistic anime characters with exaggerated eyes, slim, aquiline noses and jaws who were to be my new “friends”. The narrative of the game was that together we had to organize an upcoming charity event due to take place in 11 days.The gameplay of Mystic Messenger was unlike anything I had experienced. It did not involve collecting coins or moving through levels but chatting with these other characters through multiple-choice responses. While these characters were basically just interactive cartoon characters that would automatically respond to prompts from the player with pre-scripted answers, they still felt lifelike, and talking to them required tact and social nous. One character called Jumin liked it when I asked him about his pet cat. Another called Zen was a narcissist who only ever wanted compliments. Of all the characters in the game, I was most drawn to Jaehee, the only other woman in the group. She was the most intelligent and self-deprecating. I found her slightly sardonic attitude towards the other characters in the game funny. “It may not be fun chatting with me since I’m a woman,” she said ironically. “But I hope you do not avoid me too much.”Part of what made Mystic Messenger compelling was the fact that it ran in real time. This meant that once you started, if you stepped away from the game you would miss out on vital conversations and lose track of where you stood with your virtual friends. This social dynamic reminded me of being a teenager, when I’d come home from school and log on to MSN Messenger and sit there for hours and hours.For the first few days, I played Mystic Messenger conscientiously and tried to make sure that I responded to every one of Jaehee’s messages. I was on the app two to three hours per day, which felt like a lot. But compared with those I spoke to on forums, my commitment to the game and Jaehee was paltry.Amy, a single mum from South Africa who was part of the Mystic Messenger Addicts forum, told me that she played every day for at least six hours. Once she had successfully wooed one character, she would refresh the app and start again, focusing her attention on someone new. “That way I can fall in love with every character, get to know them all so intimately.” I asked her which of the characters she liked best so far. “That would have to be Zen,” she said. “He’s nice. Kind of like an ideal boyfriend, maybe. He knows what’s important to him. He’s into his career. He doesn’t make me feel inferior.”Natsuki, also a self-proclaimed “addict”, told me that she played for at least four hours a day and liked Jumin best. Wild Rose said that when the game first came out she would play for up to five hours a day but had since cut down. “If I could play more I would,” she said. “But I have a daughter to look after and I’m studying. This has meant many sleepless nights catching up.”When dating sims first became popular in Japan, they were often reported on by the media with a tone of moralizing disgust, partly because of the obsessive way fans played. These games were seen as an escape, a last resort for nerdy men who needed virtual girls to substitute for real, healthy heterosexual relationships. Along with anime and manga, dating sims were blamed for the low fertility rates in Japan, and the young men who played these games were sometimes described as “herbivores”, as if lacking in carnal desire. This attitude was shared by western media, too, where Japanese dating sims were seen as a curious, almost alien pathology. Following the widely reported story of Nene Anegasaki – the man who married his favorite character from the dating sim Love Plus – an article in the New York Times Magazine described these games as a last resort for men who needed virtual women as a “substitute for real, monogamous romance”.With the popularity of dating sims now growing outside Japan, similar concerns have once again emerged. In China, where a dating sim called Love and Producer was downloaded more than 7m times in its first month, media reports about the game have been mostly negative, if not alarmist. One Chinese commentator argued that the only reason young people were drawn to dating sims was because their real lives are “brutally lacking” in real love. “The simplicity, consumerism, and hypocrisy of romantic simulation games,” he wrote, “reflect the love-free disease that belongs to this era.”When I raised these criticisms with Wild Rose, she dismissed them as narrow and close-minded. She told me that playing Mystic Messenger had actually made her emotional life more stable and fulfilling. Mystic Messenger was a place where she could explore some of her unmet emotional needs, where it was safe to fantasize and imagine other ways of loving.“When I met Saeran my world changed,” she said. “I felt that he was talking to me and me alone. I felt interesting and needed.”In Japan, where this debate about intimacy with the virtual has been unfolding since the 1980s, there is a word that gives shape to the idea of loving a virtual non-human. That word is moe, which derives from the Japanese verb moeru, meaning to burst into bud. This word was originally used in ancient Japanese love poetry to describe nature blossoming into life. But within the dating sim and anime subcultures, it has come to describe the unique feeling of intimacy that one can feel for a virtual or fictional being.Japanese writer and dating sim enthusiast Honda Toru argues that moe is part of a broader “love revolution”. “Someday soon the hierarchy of real and artificial will break down,” he said in an interview in 2014. “This future will be about knowing that we are in love with fiction and accepting it … Someday we will be able to accept that the world of dreams is a good world, with a warmth and solace that cannot be found in human society.”Patrick Galbraith, an anthropologist who has studied moe and otaku culture in Japan for many years, says that the decades-long existence of dating simulations in Japan has fostered a more accepting attitude to intimacy with virtual characters. “A lot of gamers in Japan could be very angry, but they’re not,” he said. “This is because society tells them, mostly, that their new way of loving is OK. These are people are not seen as unwell, but just trying to live otherwise.” Galbraith also points out that these simulated dating environments provide a safe space to flirt without the risk of misreading social cues or being rejected. “If we would just stop pressuring people to act only within a limited set of social norms,” he said, “maybe we would have fewer toxic iniduals.”But not all gamers who play dating sims feel that they are part of a “love revolution” or ushering a new era of digital intimacy. Cecilia d’Anastasio, a game journalist who has written about Mystic Messenger, told me that most people who play the game do so because “it is fun, it is compelling, there is a narrative, it lets you master a new skill”. In fact, there are lots of dating sims players who find the idea that they are somehow falling in love with the characters in the game slightly perverse.In February, Pape Games, the developer that made Love and Producer, released an ad that portrayed a young woman telling her mother that she had finally found a husband, but that the husband was a character in the game. On Weibo, many fans of Love and Producer responded angrily. “So, this is what the company thinks about its loyal gamers?” said one. “As a married women who has a stable income and relationship, I only play this game because I like the voices of the character,” another said. “I can clearly distinguish the virtual world from reality.”But the capacity to distinguish between the real and the virtual may become harder over the next decade as game developers use AI and sophisticated natural-language processing to make characters more interactive and realistic. Aaron Reed, who works at SpiritAI – a tech company that is doing just that – told me that while we are still decades away from designing anything as persuasive as Samantha in Her, more human-like characters are going to become pervasive in the coming years.“Obviously as the technology gets better and the interactivity increases we’re going to be able to form closer connections to characters in games,” Reed said. “They will operate with greater flexibility and ultimately seem more lifelike and easier to connect to.”But for Wild Rose and many of the other dating sims enthusiasts I spoke to, making the characters more “human” wasn’t particularly exciting or even desired. Saeran didn’t need to be real for her to care about him. And she was well aware that there were probably tens of thousands of other gamers out there who he said the same loving things to. But it didn’t matter. For Wild Rose, intimacy with the virtual was something that could only be played out fully between the screen and her imagination. When she played Mystic Messenger, she allowed herself to momentarily suspend disbelief and enter this virtual relationship.She told me that in this way, her love for Saeran was very similar to how she had loved anime characters as a young girl. “When my parents were at work I would watch anime cartoons. I became very attached to some of the characters and I would draw fantasy worlds where we lived together.” When she showed these drawings to her cousins, they made fun of her. “They teased me all the time for loving these characters, and now it’s the same as people who criticize my love for Saeran,” she said. “I don’t think Saeran is human. But I think my love for him can be real even if he isn’t.”As compelling as the simulated world of Mystic Messenger was, after a week, I couldn’t keep up with the endless messages and emails from Jaehee and my other “friends”. My life in the real world kept interfering with the development of my burgeoning virtual intimacy. That is, it was difficult to justify not making dinner because I had a chat scheduled with a character in a game. This form of digital intimacy didn’t captivate me in the way it did for Wild Rose. I found my conversations with her, also conducted via text, far more compelling than my conversations with Jaehee.But playing Mystic Messenger did make me rethink my relationship with other virtual characters that I communicate with through my phone, like Siri or Slackbot. What I learnt from Wild Rose, who stood at the vanguard of relations with these virtual others, is that when we interact with these characters we are engaged in a collective suspension of disbelief, allowing ourselves to imagine that they understand us, that they are kind of alive. Yet unlike Wild Rose, most of us do not acknowledge the role imagination plays in these relationships with the non-human. We pretend that these anthropomorphic algorithms are coming alive because of technological innovation alone, rather than cultural process and collective myth-making. It is at this point that we risk losing control of the fantasy.“It’s like how people love God,” Wild Rose said the last time we spoke. “They don’t see him. They never meet him. Yet they lay their faith and love in his hands. Why don’t people understand that’s the way I love Saeran?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64213da44d011b6ef1b06e7d824fd56f32cebfd3/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=371108086ce7bfa65abca5d22f4b3a85","title":"brett kavanaugh christine blasey ford testimony","story":"Christine Blasey Ford prepares for committee hearing as Kavanaugh denies new claims in interview with RepublicansChristine Blasey Ford, the California professor who has accused the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers, will tell the US Senate judiciary committee on Thursday that she will “never forget” what happened to her at a Maryland house party nearly 36 years ago.Kavanaugh’s nomination to the supreme court hangs in the balance. He and Ford will deliver diametrically opposing accounts at the extraordinary hearing, as fresh accusations of sexual misconduct and contradictory charges swirl around a circus-like confirmation process that has been described as “surreal” and “political as hell”.“I don’t have all the answers, and I don’t remember as much as I would like to,” Ford will tell the panel, according to prepared remarks released on Wednesday. “But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget.”In her testimony, Ford calls Kavanaugh “the boy who sexually assaulted me”, ruling out any suggestion that she may be confusing him with another person. But late Wednesday night, the Senate Judiciary committee released a timeline of all staff activity in response to the allegations against Kavanaugh. The summary disclosed that\u0026nbspstaff have interviewed two different men who each told investigators “he, not Judge Kavanaugh, had the encounter with Dr Ford in the summer of 1982 that is the basis of her allegation”. The committee did not identify the men.In her testimony, Ford describes the night of the assault, stating: “I believed he was going to rape me.” She also explains the winding path that began with a letter to her congresswoman and an anonymous tip to the Washington Post and resulted in her stepping forward publicly and agreeing to testify on Capitol Hill.“I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified,” she will say. “I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.”In his testimony, Kavanaugh, Donald Trump’s second supreme court nominee, will acknowledge that he was “not perfect” in high school but will adamantly deny Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her, declaring himself “innocent of this charge”. He has also unequivocally denied allegations of sexual misconduct made public by two other women this week.“I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now,” Kavanaugh will tell the committee, according to prepared remarks released by the committee on Wednesday. “But that’s not why we are here today. What I’ve been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior.”A new accuser, Julie Swetnick, came forward on Wednesday, aided by the celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti, to allege in a sworn declaration that she observed Kavanaugh at high school parties where women were verbally and physically abused, including being present at one in which she was the victim of a “gang rape”.Kavanaugh dismissed the latest allegations as “ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone” as Trump stood by his embattled nominee, accusing Democrats of “bringing people out of the woods” in an 11th-hour attempt to block his confirmation.The judge also denied two separate allegations against him in an interview with Republican investigators for the Senate judiciary committee, according to a transcript of the conference call released by the panel on Wednesday.In the transcript, Kavanaugh denied assaulting a woman he was dating in 1998 while working for the independent counsel Ken Starr. The allegation stemmed from an anonymous complaint to the office of the Republican senator Cory Gardner of Colorado. The second incident he denied in the call related to an allegation made by an unidentified Rhode Island man “concerning a rape on a boat in August of 1985”. That allegation was relayed to the office of the Democratic senator Sheldon White House of Rhode Island.Speaking on Wednesday, Trump said it was possible that he could change his mind on Kavanaugh.“We’re giving the women a major chance to speak. It’s possible I’ll hear that and I’ll say: ‘Hey, I’m changing my mind.’ It’s possible,” he said.But he otherwise stood by his nominee, calling the allegations against Kavanaugh a “big, fat con job”. Speaking at length to reporters in New York, Trump said he viewed the accusations against Kavanaugh “differently” because he himself had “had a lot of false charges made against me”.“You have a man who is great, outstanding, but he has charges against him,” Trump said, adding: “It has happened to me many times.”The allegations have roiled his confirmation process, which Republicans expected the judge to sail through, and deeply ided the country. Protesters have flooded the Capitol and staged walkouts while Kavanaugh’s supporters defend him as a lifelong champion of women and a distinguished jurist.In light of the third accusation, the Democratic Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, has called on Kavanaugh to withdraw and another senator, Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, has filed a lawsuit in an attempt to halt the hearing.The Senate committee says it is making an effort to hold staff interviews with Swetnick and a third woman, Deborah Ramirez, who alleged in the New Yorker that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a drunken party when they were students at Yale.Thursday’s hearing will take place against the backdrop of the #MeToo, a movement that has toppled powerful men across industries. Aware of the significance of the moment, the all-male Republican panel on the committee will cede their questions to the Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell in an effort, they say, to “depoliticize” the session.Lawyers for Kavanaugh on Wednesday released to several news organizations five calendar pages from 1982 that will be presented to bolster his assertion that he was not at a house party with Ford decades ago. While Ford cannot recall the exact date or location of the party, the calendar includes several details about Kavanaugh visiting friends and some weeks are blocked out for summer trips and camp.At the same time, lawyers for Ford provided affidavits from four people – three from friends and one from her husband – who say that she told them in recent years she was assaulted by Kavanaugh when she was in high school. They also released a copy of a polygraph test she took in August in regards to her allegation, which concluded that her description of the account was “not indicative of deception”.Republicans have scheduled a committee vote for Friday and many senators say they’re eager to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination. But a handful of key Republican senators have said their vote hinges on Thursday’s hearing.“I do not believe that a claim of sexual assault is invalid because a 15-year-old girl didn’t promptly report the assault to the authorities, as the president of the United States said just two days ago,” Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican and a member of the committee whose vote could determine Kavanaugh’s fate, said in an impassioned floor speech on Wednesday.“How uninformed and uncaring do you have to be to say things like that, much less believe them? Do we have any idea what kind of message that sends, especially to young women? How many times do we have to marginalize and ignore women before we learn that important lesson?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/227587bcb84a619d3e1dfa5b0ba7a0b7f1177932/0_5_2325_1395/master/2325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=272025c742b17bba92231df55024811b","title":"what brett kavanaugh teaches us about teenage boys and male power","story":"More than 25 years ago, Anita Hill was dismissed as ‘nutty and slutty’ for alleging sexual harassment. Now another supreme court nominee stands accused. Has nothing changed?‘A bit nutty and a bit slutty.” This phrase, used by David Brock in his book The Real Anita Hill, is one I will always remember. Hill was a lawyer, who had acted as an adviser and assistant to the judge Clarence Thomas towards the start of her career she then moved into academe, and when Thomas became a US supreme court nominee in the early 1990s, nominated by the first President Bush, Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment.In October 1991, in publicly televised hearings, she said that Thomas had asked her out socially when she was working as his assistant. She added that he spoke graphically about his sexual prowess, talked about women having sex with animals and pornographic films that showed group sex or rape scenes apparently, he also once asked “Who has put pubic hair on my coke?” after examining a can on his desk.As the judiciary is a branch of the US government, nominees are, in many ways, forced to behave like political candidates, and it was understood that nominations could be “borked” – defeated by any means necessary – the word coming from the blocking of Robert Bork, another rightwinger, in 1987. When Thomas’s nomination was announced – and the Republicans desperately wanted a black conservative, which he was, in the post – Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women, declared: “We’re going to bork him.”This was more than 25 years ago. The culture war is not new we go backwards and forwards, and now have another supreme court nominee and more allegations of a sexual nature. But something is shifting. I remember the Hill hearings being shot through with racial and sexual politics. Was this just another hi–tech lynching of a good black man? Hill was accused of being both too poised and also, devastatingly, of being a sexual being. It was his word against hers. I wrote at the time: “For whatever did or did not happen struck a chord with so many women in particular that they felt that what was being told was some emotional truth beyond the comprehension of men in suits.” Others, of course, wrote that only mad, witchy, rad fems believed her at all the columnist Barbara Amiel said, with typical understament: “It seems fair to say that America today, vis-à-vis feminist thought, is at the point Germany reached before the Nazis took over.” Whoa!I wonder what has happened over the years. I wonder, frankly, at my own reticence in not believing Hill to have not clearly connected the sexual harassment she described to my own. Yes, she is speaking an emotional truth I had said, thinking somehow that that might not be the same as an actual truth.Why? Because my own experience and that of my generation involved tolerating a certain level of harassment, quasi-assault and rape as the price we paid for working, travelling, wanting to have a life, to be independent. I always knew that seeking equality was risky. Stuff would happen to you, sexual stuff, slights and outright harassment, and it was a sign of strength that you didn’t complain. The humiliation was internalised. The shame was shoved down the back of your throat. There was little choice about swallowing or spitting. A lot of women swallowed our hurt, but then we found ourselves regurgitating it, often at inappropriate times. I never liked the word trauma: it seemed too dramatic to describe the things men did, or tried to do, to you. We were taught not to be dramatic.When I read Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation against Donald Trump’s current supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, it stuck in my throat. “With Kavanaugh’s hand over my mouth, I feared he may inadvertently kill me,” she has said. Her allegation is that, back in 1982, at a party, when she was 15 and he was 17, Kavanaugh locked her in a room with his friend Mark Judge. Kavanaugh was on top of her and was trying to get her clothes off. Judge allegedly egged him on, and also told him to stop at various points. Kavanaugh was very drunk. Blasey Ford is now a professor. Since the allegation, Deborah Ramirez, who went to Yale with Kavanaugh, has alleged in the New Yorker magazine that Kavanaugh thrust his penis against her face when they were both drinking at a college party in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied all the allegations and Judge says he never saw Kavanaugh behave in that way.But now another woman, Julie Swetnick, has said she attended “well over 10” house parties in the 80s where Kavanaugh and Judge were present. She said she saw Kavanaugh “engage in abusive and physically aggressive behaviour towards girls, including pressing girls against him without their consent, ‘grinding’ against girls and attempting to remove or shift girls clothing to expose private body parts”. In addition, she says she saw “efforts by Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be ‘gang raped’ in a side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys …” She herself, she went on to say, was gang raped at a party where Kavanaugh and Judge were present. They have yet to respond to these new allegations.The US president, an unrepentant sexual predator, hasn’t been put off by the earlier allegations against his supreme court pick. Trump has not used the phrase “A bit nutty and a bit slutty“ about Blasey Ford because, apart from anything else, he does not read. But he has dismissed the women who have come forward as drunken, politically motivated Democrats.Let’s be clear: Kavanaugh is not accused of rape and is not in court he may simply not get the job he wants. He wants that job badly enough to have gone on Fox News this week, sitting alongside his concerned-looking wife, and telling us that he was in fact a virgin during his high school years – as if this means he has never disrespected women. His somewhat holier-than-thou persona is, of course, at odds with his yearbook entries these involve him and many of his former classmates slut-shaming a woman called Renate (a large number of them referring to themselves as “Renate alumni”) and alluding to his legendary drinking.It is possible that this man engaged in hardcore frat-boy antics, but never did anything bad to any women. Strangely though, all the things he is accused of are performances for other men, a botched show of sexual prowess and potency. The women concerned are vessels to be exchanged in this cementing of male friendship. This is common enough for it to be ordinary. Just a thing guys do. It will be a rare woman who doesn’t experience a shudder of recognition on reading these allegations, and an instant passport to incidents that occurred in their own teenage years.The rhetorical question that keeps being voiced is: “What boy hasn’t done this in high school?” The idea of pinning a girl down against her will and making her feel she may die is apparently thoroughly normal. The answer to this is surely that a lot of boys haven’t, and never would, that it is not OK now and was not OK in the 70s or 80s, an era now spoken of as unwoke compared with the present, where we know what is and is not acceptable.This is patently rubbish. We know that many teenage girls are wearing shorts under their skirts so as not to be groped at school shots from hardcore porn films are now used as screensavers and girls commonly fear being shamed on social media. We know about the incredibly small chance of a rapist being convicted in this country, and the character assassinations of female accusers. We know that some girls are deemed uncredible. In the UK, the police described certain girls in the Rotherham grooming cases as “unrapeable” children who had blood running down their legs.But it is in the US that we more usually see these high-profile rape trials play out, such as that of Brock Turner, who raped an unconscious woman. His father said afterwards that his sentence was: “A steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of 20 years of his life.” A brutal sexual assault was reduced to 20 minutes of action. What did that 20 minutes of action take from the woman who was raped? And what was the sentence that was deemed too harsh? A six-month sentence in county jail, of which he served three months.Even if Kavanaugh did the things he is accused of, does it matter all these years later? Is it possible to be out of control as a young man – and perfectly respectful of women as an older one? It probably is, but it woud require a degree of honesty, a glimmer of self-reflection at least. Instead, Kavanaugh is now involved in some peculiar audition before the US public, in which he is presenting himself as the most perfect young man who ever lived.That this pantomime is being performed while we watch another – a zombie-like Bill Cosby, cuffed and unrepentant, finally being taken to prison – is odd, to say the least. It took the testimony of more than 60 women and many years to bring Cosby down, and still we wonder if he is perhaps too old to be imprisoned. At what age is one beyond justice?Kavanaugh’s alleged “crimes” are small fry compared with Cosby’s. Who will judge the judge at the judiciary hearing on Thursday? Other men, it turns out 11 of them, but with “a female assistant” they have hired for the occasion. You couldn’t make this stuff up. Again, in this story as in so many others, women are wives and assistants. In this ideological battle, even the GOP are uneasy. It just may be that, as has been alleged, Kavanaugh insisted his clerks be pretty, that women look a certain way. Trump does the same. It is the way things always were. It is the way they are now emboldened to be again.Stephen King nailed the boys-will-be-boys mantra. He tweeted that Kavanaugh may have drunk hard and partied heavily: “Those behaviours change with age,” he wrote, “but the attitudes and assumptions which drove those behaviours rarely do.” It seems to me perfectly possible that a man who is now a “carpool dad” did what he has been accused of. If sexual assault was only carried out by monsters, it would not be part of most women’s experience of growing up. This is what #MeToo has revealed. Here, then, we get the push back.Interestingly, many conservative women are unhappy with Kavanaugh, too. They are unsure they understand why women don’t always come forward with accusations of rape and assault. The unease comes when experience and belief systems clash. For any women this is difficult it is easier to shut up and shut down about much of this. The #MeToo movement has opened up a conversation about pain ordinary pain, what so many of us accept as just stuff that happens. We don’t want this for our daughters. That much we do know.So, 27 years on from Anita Hill, we are not yet at the stage of believing women because it is still so uncomfortable even to listen to them. Men will decide if this man is fit to sit on the supreme court and make judgments over what women do with their bodies. If appointed, he will be on the supreme court for life.This man says he behaved honourably, while some of his fellow students remember a belligerent drunk. I don’t know if he put his hand over a woman’s mouth while he was on top of her. I do know too well what that feels like though.This is not only about Kavanaugh. It is about the silencing of women while decisions are made for us – and about us. It is about power God forbid the nutty and the slutty – as all women are ultimately perceived – should speak the truth in these televised hearings. Women voters will watch this though. And they will watch, carefully, the men in charge who get to decide who to believe – and who to silence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fc8a5768febd1118fe5dfcc6f4598f36a6d8d2f/0_312_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aefc8e4bfa8c41fff7242674a9cedec5","title":"brazil elections comprova project misiniformation whatsapp","story":"When a story goes viral, Comprova assigns it to a journalist to investigate if it is fake or notVoting machines rigged by Venezuela suspicious connections with George Soros elderly conservatives beaten up by leftwing activists a candidate’s name spelled out in huge letters across a soy field – these are just a few of the viral WhatsApp and Facebook posts that have been investigated by Comprova, an initiative to fight misinformation in the run-up to Brazil’s presidential elections on 7 October.All of the above were deemed “deceitful” – except the soy field, which, to the surprise of the debunkers, turned out to be true.With former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in prison and banned from running due to a controversial criminal conviction, and far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro leading the polls, the election campaign has become the most isive in the country’s recent history.And in a highly polarised, social-media obsessed nation, misinformation flows free and fast.In an effort to fight fake news, 24 media organisations – ranging from national newspapers and television networks to specialist and local publications – have joined forces under the name Comprova, or Prove It. The project is backed by the Boston-based First Draft, a project of Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center – which has worked with other verification projects in the UK, Mexico and France.When stories go viral, Comprova assigns them to journalists across the country to investigate and at least three different publications have to sign off for a verification to go live. The Comprova website gets almost no traffic, but the project reaches many millions through the collaborating outlets that publish their findings.The main battlefield in the fight against fake news is Whatsapp: with 120 million users, Brazil is one of the messaging service’s largest markets.“WhatsApp is the most important communication tool in Brazil, and it’s totally closed from start to finish – we have no way to track what’s spreading,” said Sérgio Lüdtke, Comprova’s executive editor. “Polarisation leads people to bubbles, bubbles that are infected with misinformation that ide society.”On a recent afternoon at the Comprova newsroom in São Paulo, five editors manned a WhatsApp tip line and monitored Facebook and Twitter stories through social-media monitoring tools like Spike and CrowdTangle.“That photo is from years ago, I remember it,” said José Antonio Lima, peering at a meme which showed players from São Paulo’s most popular football team, Corinthians holding a sign that read, “Strength, Lula!”Appearing just weeks before the election, it appeared to be an endorsement of Lula, but the Comprova team soon confirmed that the original photo was from 2011, when the Workers’ party leader was diagnosed with cancer.By the end of that day, they had hit 60 verifications.In recent days, Comprova found numerous videos to be fake or out of context: one clip purporting to show leftwing supporters attacking a car with a Bolsonaro sticker was found to be from a 2017 protest against the current president Michel Temer. A viral image showing the leftwing VP candidate Manuela D’Avila with tattoos of Vladimir Lenin and Che Guevara was quickly found to be false.“Like the US, Brazil is very polarised – and there’s a lot of religion and race in politics. Misinformation that would circulate on Facebook in the US circulates on WhatsApp in Brazil – sometimes on a more significant scale,” said First Draft’s director, Claire Wardle.Following the near-fatal knife attack on Bolsonaro, Janailson Santos de Almeida, a 27-year-old geography student, received an audio message in a WhatsApp group of leftwing youth activists.It purported to be a rant by the candidate as he recovered in the hospital and it had been shared to add fuel to rumors that the stabbing itself was fake.Santos de Almeida was doubtful the audio was real, “It just didn’t feel right.” He, along with 400 others, sent the audio to Comprova, who concluded that the voice on the recording was not Bolsonaro.“I don’t trust a lot of those outlets, but them all working together makes them neutral,” Santos de Almeida said.What happened next demonstrates the limits of fact-checking: Santos de Almeida told other members of his Whatsapp group that the audio was false, but several told him they didn’t care and would carry on sharing it. “It’s scary. Our democracy is being undermined by all this fake information.”First Draft hopes to learn from Brazil as they gear up to launch other initiatives in Nigeria, India and Indonesia ahead of presidential elections – three other WhatsApp-crazed nations.Wardle, said the group is still trying to strike a balance between debunking fake posts and giving them too much attention.“We’re trying to keep an open mind and learning as we go. We don’t have enough information on what the impact of misinformation and the debunking efforts behind them. This is something the world is still getting used to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b6acb5016ccccc7742c9d360f5d29771281546/4_84_1262_757/master/1262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20a921a3d5c6e98619431cd087fc23f","title":"corporations behind increase in developing world debt report","story":"Poorest countries have little protection against Trump’s trade wars and growth slumpAn “explosion” in corporate and household debt across the developing world since the financial crisis has left some of the world’s poorest countries with little protection against Donald Trump’s trade wars and a slowdown in global growth.The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) warned in its annual health check on the global economy that while governments had kept a lid on their debts, private corporations were behind a dramatic increase in developing-world debts.“The core concern is the continued strong dependence of tepid global growth on debt,” it said.Since 2008, global debt has soared from $142tn to $250tn, which is three times the combined income of every nation. Unctad said that this situation was worse than expected after global incomes failed to keep pace with rising debt levels.The report found that the ratio of global debt to GDP is one third higher than in 2008 before the crash. And the situation was much worse in developed-world countries that had borrowed heavily in recent years from western banks offering ultra-cheap short-term loans.Turkey and Argentina are among a group of nations that have suffered a severe economic shock since the US Federal Reserve began increasing interest rates, which pushed up borrowing costs to their largest businesses.Argentina was forced last month to request aid from the International Monetary Fund while many investors have taken bets that Turkey will soon follow suit. African countries, including Zambia, are on a watchlist at the IMF’s headquarters in Washington in case they also find they are unable to pay interest bills on their ballooning debts.Unctad said a recent increase in oil and some commodity prices had bailed out those countries that had previously faced the double whammy of a decline in export income and higher debt costs.However, the likelihood of an escalation in trade war between the US, China and Europe, and slower global growth still left them vulnerable to defaulting on their rising interest bills.The report also argued that developing-world countries were suffering at the hands of global corporations, most them based in the developed world.“This sheer size reinforced the gradual dilution of social and political accountability of large corporations to national constituencies and labour around the world,” it said.Free-trade zones, often near coastal towns and port cities, have played a part in offering multinational companies a virtually tax-free base from which to assemble manufactured goods such as cars, fridges and cookers.In a seemingly clear reference to the US tech giants Apple and Amazon, Unctad said: “The increase in profits of large “superstar” firms has been a major driver of global inequality, widening the gap between a small number of big winners and a large collection of smaller companies and workers that are being squeezed.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3642545.1537983335!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"from flimsy prefab to state of the art facility stepaside s newest national school","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents gather outside Stepaside Educate Together National School, Sandyford, Dublin, which was officially opened on Wednesday. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillSeven years ago it was a flimsy prefab with a single teacher and seven students on the grounds of De La Salle Palmerstown rugby club.But a gleaming new building for Stepaside Educate Together National School in Sandyford – set to be one of the State’s biggest primary schools – has now officially opened.The €8 million building, which has 24 classrooms and a special-needs unit, will accommodate more than 600 pupils.The primary school currently has some 200 pupils and is set to grow rapidly over the coming years, having taken in three streams of junior infants this year. However, for the meantime it is sharing its premises with Stepaside Educate Together Secondary School, which is due to move to a permanent setting, with capacity for 1,000 pupils, over the coming years.Anne Carroll, the primary school principal, recalled its early days in the foothills of the Dublin mountains. “It was a lovely start: it was a countryside location. We had deer visiting us in the yard every day. We were really happy there but we outgrew it very quickly. The good name of the school spread.”As the school grew and moved to larger temporary premises, it became clear that a long-term facility would be needed.“We started out with kindness and respect. And when we talked how we imagined our new school, we wanted it to be a place of high standards, of course, in teaching and learning, but kindness and respect were the most important things. And I think we’ve done that,” Ms Carroll said. At an ceremony attended by Cabinet ministers Josepha Madigan and Shane Ross, Minister for Education Richard Bruton said he was delighted to officially open the new school.“You can see from the spirit and enthusiasm here that this is much more than bricks and mortar – this is a fantastic school in a growing community,” the Minister said.“To have this as a hub, accommodating the secondary school as well – it’s a model of what can be done.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsDublin Bus managers are “firmly in the tent” for pushing through a controversial plan to overhaul the capital’s bus network, the board of the National Transport Authority (NTA) has been told.Tim Gaston, director of public transport services at NTA, which is behind the BusConnects plan, also warned board members to be prepared for a “sustained campaign of criticism” against the proposals.A presentation given to the board ahead of the plan being published in July states that this would include attacks on consultant Jarrett Walker, who headed the redesign, as an “American consultant who doesn’t understand Ireland”.It said that should an offensive be launched on Mr Walker, the NTA should counter by calling “on other experienced experts” during the public consultation period.The NTA hired John Barry, a recently retired head of bus planning at Transport for London, as another expert. He is “supportive and is assisting in implementation planning”, according to the briefing presentation, which outlines risks to the €2 billion plan and ways to “mitigate” them.Asked about the presentation, an NTA spokeswoman said: “It would be normal business practise to present a risk analysis of activities like this.”The NTA briefing, seen by The , shows the authority was concerned about the threat of public protests receiving “disproportionate media coverage”. Those involved were told to be prepared to “respond to concerns before localised issues escalate”.As part of a strategy to counter public opposition to the reforms, there was a further warning about the possibility of “unexpected opposition from stakeholders, political and others, that we anticipated would support the concepts, if not the detail”.Minister for Transport Shane Ross told a residents’ association meeting in his constituency last week that he had nothing to do with BusConnects, no responsibility for the NTA and would be objecting to some aspects of it.In the event of such a political reaction, the NTA presentation advised that staff “draw on Dublin Bus’s Network Direct experience to assist in planning stakeholder management”. Network Direct was a 2010 programme designed to save the company €12 million, which saw a number of routes amalgamated and led to protests in some areas.The NTA briefing said: “It’s important to note that Dublin Bus management are ‘firmly in the tent’.”It also warns about NTA resources being “overstretched” in pushing through the plan. This is an “ongoing risk”, which outsourcing and using “Dublin Bus experienced people” can mitigate against, “at least in the short term”.Asked about the reference to Dublin Bus managers, an NTA spokesman said it was in response to concerns that BusConnects might threaten the State-owned company.“The reference to them ‘being in the tent’ was simply a reassurance to the NTA board that Dublin Bus were supportive of the plan and that NTA and Dublin Bus were working closely together on the network review,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3642331.1537984031!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"higgins defends %C3%A1ras allowances as he launches re election bid","story":"It appears likely that voters will have six candidates to choose from on October 26th. Political correspondent Harry McGee reports. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAll six candidates have submitted nomination papers at Custom House in Dublin in the last few days.Michael D Higgins has defended the unaudited allowance of €317,000 paid to Presidents but said he has no difficulty in finding a mechanism to provide a formal statement providing more details about spending in the Áras. “I have no difficulty in constructing a formal statement that can live within the Constitution and at the same time accept the independence of the president whoever he or she is,” he said of the allowance which has been available since 1938, and at is present level of €317,000 since 1998. Nominations for the presidential election officially closed at noon. There are six candidates in the running including Mr Higgins.Speaking at the official launch of his re-election campaign, Mr Higgins said he had began the process of supplying more information during the summer and would continue to do so. He also said the Comptroller and Auditor General could have a role in that process. However, he said that he never sees the allowance and that it is used for the many events that take place in the Áras each year, including many garden parties and State dinners. There are 20,000 visitors to his residence each year, he said. “If you didn’t want to serve a cup of tea to those elderly citizens, if you didn’t want to receive those citizens who were in the Magdalene Laundries or those associated with the Irish language movement and indeed all the different voluntary groups - you could stop it by a vote in the Oireachtas by saying you want the President out there, receiving nobody, doing nothing but occasionally signing a paper that you wanted him or her to sign,” he said later in an interview with RTÉ Radio One’s Drivetime. Asked at the launch of his campaign about the comments made by fellow candidate Peter Casey, who raised the possibility that the incident involving an intruder in the Áras was a stunt, Mr Higgins said: “I do hope you have an opportunity to ask Mr Casey about his langauge and his use of it.“The gate was open and (the intruder) drove in and the door was open and came in to a door beside my office. “We had a conversation. There were a few things we discussed. When that was finished I left the room under my own volition. “She was then interviewed by a senior garda. She was an unemployed person. I wished her well. That’s how it should be.”Asking himself about Mr Casey’s charge it was a stunt, he said: “Maybe that candidate is not too long back from America.”In a long question and answer session with journalists, he also said that among the reasons he had changed his mind was because of the new challenges that have emerged including Brexit, climate change, immigration and sustainability. He said they presented an opportunity for him to present new ideas and a strong voice. Asked about his age, Mr Higgins (77) said he was fit and healthy. “My health is excellent, in so far as any of us can say. I am very fit and I am really looking forward to getting into campaign within the constraints of my present position. “I have much more energy and efficiency than in 2011 because I (underwent an operation on my knee). “I don’t drink and don’t smoke and I have a yoga teacher.”Asked about comments by Senator Gerard Craughwell that he stayed in suite at a luxury hotel in Switzerland this year , costing more than €3,000 per night, the President maintained he had never asked to stay in a particular hotel. “The arrangement for the President and where he stays are made by the Department of Foreign Affairs without consultation.“I have never asked to stay in a particular hotel. I have stayed in hostels and stayed in tents and with Concern in Somalia. “It is a question I never ask. I don’t really think… about all of that when I do go abroad. “The ambassador and the host country are involved and then there are those who have security concerns,” he said. Earlier, Mr Higgins said he is the person who is the best placed to be Ireland’s voice through the Brexit process and during a potentially volatile period ahead.At the official launch of his campaign in Dublin, President Higgins also said he would champion equality, widen participation in society, and promote ersity. “Citizens have spoke to me about the uncertainty of Brexit, about the fragility of our international systems and shared planet,” he said. “They believe that Ireland’s voice can and must matter in a difficult global landscape.”In the only political comments in his speech, he made veiled criticism of the European Union. “I have long called for a reconnection between Europe’s institutions and and European Street and this will become ever more essential in the coming years,” he said. He argued for Ireland to be a champion for human rights and for sustainable development, as well as peace. He also said he would continue to deepen connections with the Irish diaspora. All six candidates have submitted nomination papers at Custom House in Dublin in the last few days.Businessman and star of Ireland’s Dragons’ Den Gavin Duffy became an official candidate after securing the support of Waterford, Meath, Carlow and Wicklow councils.Sean Gallagher was backed by Roscommon, Leitrim, Mayo and Wexford councils, while Senator Joan Freeman received four nominations from Cork City, Galway County, Fingal and Galway City. Businessman Peter Casey was backed by Kerry, Clare, Limerick and Tipperary councils.Sinn Féin selected MEP Liadh Ní Riada as its candidate last week.Mr Higgins nominated himself to run for re-election. In keeping with precedent for the nomination of a sitting president, his nomination papers were submitted by his representative Art O’Leary, secretary general to the president, who was accompanied by the president’s election agent Conor Power.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Mexican waves, waspish one-liners, bockety knees, missing dogs and multiple visions to beat the band.A joyous photograph of the President flinging his arms skyward in sync with the crowd at the Liam Miller testimonial match set the early tone for his day. It made everyone smile. It preceded the official start of his campaign for the presidency in a re-election exercise that has been meticulously plotted from a long way out. At least that’s how it looks. He has some operation behind him.After witnessing the 77-year-old candidate’s performance, you’d be afraid for the other five. But for all the high-flown rhetoric, the standing on impressive records and the promises of creative engagements to come, it was Michael D’s personality that shone the strongest. The man who wants to continue as a “President for All of Us” set a precedent for all of them by his assured handling of a potentially difficult public appearance after seven years of being cosseted by the state in Áras an Uachtaráin. In the course of a press conference in his campaign headquarters on Wednesday afternoon, he also revealed that he is doing yoga. At this point, a number of colour writers fell off their chairs and were carried, senseless, from the room. There is no getting over the image. There were some difficult questions to be asked and answered. However, in the very long run-up to the contest proper, Higgins has had lots of time to prepare his answers. He safely sailed through the questions about how the presidency is funded and staying in expensive hotels when travelling abroad on behalf of the nation. Questions about his remarks following the death of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, or the unfair advantage he would seem to have over his rivals were addressed head on. As was the slightly delicate but very relevant topic of his age and how it might impact on his ability to carry out his duties. He was forthcoming and disarming in his replies. On age: “I knew some people, in fact, who were very ancient people when they were chronologically very young. And, tragically, some of them didn’t change.” The claque of supporters at the back of the room burst into applause.He is feeling better than he did seven years ago. “I had my knee done,” he declared, before dropping the yoga bombshell.His headquarters is in a very nice building on Lord Edward Street, not far from Dublin Castle. It was buzzing with staff on Wednesday and the merchandise is ready to roll.He made his first campaign speech with five long Michael D display posters forming a backdrop. One had a message at the top, the next at the bottom and so on. This meant that his head was at different heights in the display, like a whack-a-mole game.The room wasn’t particularly large, which gave the impression that the crowd was absolutely huge. A large number of young supporters took up many of the seats while many faces from his first presidential election campaign were spotted among his team. “As you know, I am now running as an independent candidate in this election.” There wasn’t as much as a bashful titter from all the old Labour party hands scattered around the room. Also there were faces recognisable from the recent marriage equality and abortion referendums.And with this being a big election, with a very definite front-runner and lots of numbers waiting to be crunched, barrister Noel Whelan was a very visible presence. He can’t resist a good election. At least most of the time – Noel flirted with the idea of challenging Michael D for the job but decided against. As journalists assembled for the big reveal, soothing piped music was being piped into the room. The sort of music you hear in places where they talk of “mindfulness” or when a woman is giving birth in a paddling pool in her living room.For Wednesday, and the rest of the month, Michael D Higgins is a mere commoner. Except when he is the President. He says he will be able to juggle both these roles for the duration of the campaign. Then again, it must be difficult for others when their main rival arrived in a Merc with a Garda driver and everyone goes quiet because he is the First Citizen. And he has a couple of plainclothes detectives standing watch wherever he goes. On Wednesday, the crowd even went quiet before he came into his own launch. “Shhhh!” said somebody as he was about to appear and nobody said a word when he ambled in with Sabina. He looked slightly taken aback, as if he had been expecting a noisy reception. The good navy three-piece suit was on for the occasion along with the paisley tie from the election poster. His campaign colours are green merging into blue. Blue is the official colour of Ireland. The only concession to his Labour past is the bright red Michael D full stop.He was asked what he thought of the candidate Peter Casey’s insinuation that the incident in the Áras last Friday – where a woman (hardly an intruder) drove up the drive through the open front gate, parked outside his front door and went in for a chat – was a maybe a bit more than a coincidence. After explaining, gently, “in fairness to the woman involved” that it was no big deal and he wished her well “and that’s how it should be, how else should it be?”, he made a stinging little remark about businessman Casey. “Maybe that candidate is not too long back from America.”Then a complicated question about whether he has an unfair advantage over his rivals led to this quip to reporter Gavan Reilly: “I think you have more than a double hypothesis there and you might have managed a treble...”He was ready for every question. He has been doing his homework. His speech was short and he kept saying he wanted to be brief. We’ll see how long that lasts. Michael D is strong on the vision guff: “In marking each act of nation-building, I also hope to spark a renewed sense of collective vision-making.” But it is guff of the highest quality. He is also “going to build on the ethics of memory” by “making sure that an event of the past doesn’t rob you of the opportunities of the present and doesn’t deprive you of the imaginative futures that you construct together”. He will be very difficult to topple. Unless he topples himself, his rivals have their work cut out for them. There was only one disappointment at the launch. “I wish he had brought his dogs.

File photograph: Alan BetsonThe .Nominations for the presidential election officially closed at noon on Wednesday, with six candidates on the official ballot paper.Within hours of the nominations closing, the campaigns of all six candidates were fully under way, with the incumbent, President Michael D Higgins, launching his campaign in Dublin city centre on Wednesday afternoon.In a late effort, a seventh potential candidate, journalist Gemma O’Doherty, tried to persuade 20 members of the Oireachtas to support her nomination before the noon deadline.However, in a tweet Ms O’Doherty disclosed she had received the backing of 11 TDs and Senators: Joan Collins, Clare Daly, Mick Wallace, Catherine Connolly, Michael Fitzmaurice, Seán Canney, Tommy Broughan, Séamus Healy, Maureen O’Sullivan, Mattie McGrath and Rónán Mullen.It is understood that a small number of others might have been willing to sign her nomination paper but were not in a position to do so before the deadline.The first broadcast debate of the campaign will take place today on RTÉ’s News at One but neither President Higgins nor Seán Gallagher will be taking part.The Sinn Féin candidate Liadh Ní Riada’s posters began appearing throughout the State yesterday, but without her party’s logo.Asked about the absence of the logo on the posters, she told RTÉ that while she was honoured to be a Sinn Féin candidate, she wanted to be a “president for all the people”.She said the absence of a reference to her party represented a “fresh approach and a new approach”.Under repeated questioning on Drivetime about her comments about the HPV vaccine against cervical cancer (for teenage girls), she said she fully supported the vaccine but refused to ulge if her own teenage daughters had received it, citing their rights to privacy.The businessman Peter Casey, in a separate interview, said his suggestion that an incident involving an intruder in Áras an Uachtaráin was a stunt was said “tongue-in-cheek” but he added: “Seven years without a security breach and then we have one a week before an election campaign.”Seán Gallagher told the broadcaster that he had spent the past seven years starting a family, rebuilding his own life, focusing on business and writing for The Sunday Independent.“Over the last seven years I have been involved in many substantial issues. I am not always tweeting and they are not always in the public eye,” he said.There have been questions raised during the campaign about Mr Gallagher’s absence from public life in the past seven years.Gavin Duffy defended a plan he had to set up a programme that would have young people aged between 18 and 25 involved in an “Irish corps” and work on aid and projects in the developing world.The election will take place on October 26th with the new president being inaugurated on November 11th.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3641165.1537893405!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"santorini the greek island caught in a tourism trap","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTourists in Santorini. Photograph: Athanasios GioumpasisGetty ImagesImagine 2½ million tourists arriving each summer on Inishmore. That’s the number of visitors to the Greek island of Mykonos – half by plane, half by cruise ship.And the same on Santorini, one of the world’s top island destinations. But the difference is that, where the mayor of Mykonos hopes to expand visitor numbers throughout the year, the mayor of saturated Santorini is calling for less.No one can put a stop to the increase in tourism in Greece, not least because it is Greece’s number one industry and an increasingly important part of the country’s still shrinking economy. Officially, the tourism industry employs 400,000 people (20 per cent of the country’s workforce). Technically, in the village where I live, no one is “employed” in tourism, but in the summer almost every available pair of hands, from grandchildren to grandparents, is hustled into the bars and tavernas to lay tables, serve food, cook, wash dishes and provide friendly back-up.While climate, landscape and accommodation are basic factors, the most vital ingredient is the people who provide the service. Throughout Greece these are not so much the upmarket hoteliers but the local people earning a crucial living from the six-month season.But tourism is almost entirely unregulated and lacks any purposeful encouragement at government level. While “mass tourism” from package deals and cruise ships is essential, niche markets such as marinas (where Greece is outstripped by near neighbour Croatia), golf courses (almost non-existent at present), skiing and cultural specialisms including gastro-tours and wine festivals are underexploited. The “image” of Greece as a destination with a purpose beyond sun, sand, sea and sex is in urgent need of remedial treatment.The term “human resources”, which has replaced the term “personnel”, is totally relevant here: Greece’s human resources or personnel are its greatest asset, yet they receive little support from the tourism ministry, which is driven by the need to maximise the statistics: “Never mind the quality, feel the width.”The mayor of Santorini, Nikolaos Zorzos, has limited the number of tourists from cruise ships to 8,000 per day. It’s a local, unilateral action that doesn’t take into account the additional 6,000 day-trippers arriving on local ferries. Locals complain that “All they want is to see the sunset”. Zorzos says: “If I have to close the streets I will do so. We have come to the point that if we do not do anything, the success will return as a boomerang against us. So we have to see what we can do to protect and preserve our uniqueness. The challenges we face are many. We are an island with urban problems.”Due to the explosion of Airbnb rentals, seasonal workers coming to the island can find nowhere to sleep. Rubbish disposal is near-impossible, and from early morning the traffic jams created by tourist buses make the island’s tiny streets impassable. There’s a constant danger of water shortage (as there is on Mykonos too). But the greatest contributor to the congestion is the defiance of planning laws.Zorzos points to unlicensed hotel construction as a factor not only crowding the island numerically but pushing out its other major feature: production of the world-famous Assyrtiko wine, grown on Santorini’s unique volcanic soil. “The island has become one huge hotel,” he says.Last month Greece exited the eight-year bailout programme. But, with the prospect of continuing in-depth surveillance and a massive, immovable, national debt, it needs sensibly managed tourism more than ever. The economy – apart from tourism – has shrunk 25 per cent, and foreign investors, crucial to growth, are still deterred by the fragility and uncertainty of the exchequer.There is no advantage in pointing at any inidual, any political party or any specific section of the international community for the scenario the country is now facing. Successive governments merely faced an impossible task: how to make an essentially traditional society, still in the painful aftermath of a world war, a civil war and a military junta, into a modern capitalistic state, when almost its sole assets are its landscape, its heritage and its people.Santorini’s “preserve our uniqueness” applies not only to the physical beauty of Greece’s sunsets, crystal-clear warm waters and the inimitable xenophilia that make up the idea of Hellenism. It also identifies the aspirations, celebrations and the essential filotimo (love of honour) that make Greek people Greek.Greece may be unique in its classical civilisation and antiquities, but its age-old reputation for hospitality has inundated it with sunseekers who care little for the culture of the “human resources”, which is the legacy of those previous centuries. This culture can play a vital role in rebranding the tourist industry. It is one of the most persuasive examples of the truth that one must understand the past and carry it into the future as an asset rather than a liability."},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin russias action man president in pictures","story":"Vladimir Putin\u0027s Kremlin press office has cultivated a swashbuckling image over the many years he has been in power.

It\u0027s a natural thing to use.Landscape is nature. The previous window put up in here was also nature, lilies.It\u0027s a rather celebratory thing. It\u0027s the height of the spring and summer.The artist said of the window\u0027s Westminster Abbey home: I know this is a historic place and I know it\u0027s going to last.Hockney once said that he turned down the chance to paint the Queen because he was very busy painting England actually, her country.He said of designing his first stained glass window: I learnt something about glass. It was a challenge.The artist said of Westminster Abbey: I know this is a historic place and I know it\u0027s going to last.Asked whether he had any response to the window from the Queen, who has seen a sketch and will see the real thing when she visits Westminster Abbey in November, said: Not yet, but I hope she\u0027ll like it. I\u0027m sure she will.” he said: Not yet but I hope she\u0027ll like it. I\u0027m sure she will.Westminster Abbey said that the result reflects the Queen as a countrywoman and her widespread delight in, and yearning for, the countryside.The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, said: I\u0027m excited by it.I think there\u0027s absolutely no harm at all in having something which is particular and vibrant and different.Some of the glass here is not very good. Some of it is not too bad, but this has a wonderful, beautiful, easily accessible vibrant colour. I think people will enjoy it.He added: It\u0027s going to be here until the end. Who knows what\u0027s going to happen in the future.Hockney, 81, is one of Britain\u0027s most-loved artists and famous for his Yorkshire landscapes and paintings of Californian life.Barley Studio, a stained glass studio based in York, created the window using traditional techniques.Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump cites personal experience of \u0026#39false accusations\u0026#39 in robust defence of Brett KavanaughAmbulances ‘being used as taxis’ heaping needless pressures on A\u0026ampE, watchdog warns More than two hours screentime a day could damage children’s brain development Golfing partners hit \u0026#39one in 17 million\u0026#39 double hole in oneSkripal \u0026#39hitman\u0026#39 unmasked as GRU colonel awarded Russia\u0026#39s highest military honour by Vladimir PutinComment: Scientific breakthroughs are great but we also need ambition and political will to beat TBJewish leaders attack Corbyn for complaining about \u0026#39tough summer\u0026#39 as he fails to apologise for anti-SemitismTheresa May dismisses Archbishop of Canterbury\u0026#39s attack on welfare, saying work is \u0026#39best way out of poverty\u0026#39Comment: The UN needs a new body to investigate war crimes so that no one can escape justiceComment: The terrifying truth is that Middle England is falling for CorbynomicsVenice considers alcohol ban to combat tourismThe Apprentice in photoshop row as pictures show candidates with three handsUS arrests Chinese \u0026#39spy recruit\u0026#39 as ties deteriorate further between Beijing and Washington Beeramisu?

If approved, tourists could reportedly face fines of anywhere from €50 (£56) to €500 (£450) for sitting on an unauthorised surfaceMeanwhile Florence recently introduced fines for visitors found to be eating panini, pizza and focaccia on the pavement and on shop doorsteps in the city’s historic centre.Tourists who find themselves on the wrong side of the law, which came into effect in early September, face fines of between €150-€500 (£135-£450).Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump cites personal experience of \u0026#39false accusations\u0026#39 in robust defence of Brett KavanaughAmbulances ‘being used as taxis’ heaping needless pressures on A\u0026ampE, watchdog warns More than two hours screentime a day could damage children’s brain development Golfing partners hit \u0026#39one in 17 million\u0026#39 double hole in oneSkripal \u0026#39hitman\u0026#39 unmasked as GRU colonel awarded Russia\u0026#39s highest military honour by Vladimir PutinComment: Scientific breakthroughs are great but we also need ambition and political will to beat TBJewish leaders attack Corbyn for complaining about \u0026#39tough summer\u0026#39 as he fails to apologise for anti-SemitismTheresa May dismisses Archbishop of Canterbury\u0026#39s attack on welfare, saying work is \u0026#39best way out of poverty\u0026#39Comment: The UN needs a new body to investigate war crimes so that no one can escape justiceComment: The terrifying truth is that Middle England is falling for CorbynomicsThe Apprentice in photoshop row as pictures show candidates with three handsUS arrests Chinese \u0026#39spy recruit\u0026#39 as ties deteriorate further between Beijing and Washington Beeramisu?

One to three hours of additional waiting for goods at the border could put 14 per cent of firms out of business, rising to 15 per cent for a 12 to 24 hour delay, the results suggested.UK will be \u0027unequivocally pro-business\u0027 after Brexit, May saysBusiness groups and leading industry figures from a number of sectors have warned for months of the potentially disastrous impact of customs delays if the UK does not secure a trade deal with the EU before Brexit on 29 March.Despite the potential chaos of a no-deal Brexit, 10 per cent of supply managers surveyed said they would prefer that outcome than the Chequers deal currently being proposed by Theresa May.The prime minister\u0027s blueprint is supposed to allow the greatest possible access to the EU\u0026nbspwhile respecting the referendum result and solving the problem of the Irish border.But it has faced fierce opposition from within the Ms May’s own party and was humiliatingly rejected by EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg last week.No customs checks are currently required for goods entering the UK from the EU and any additional admin or paperwork threatens business models that rely on frictionless trade.Nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of UK businesses said they are planning to stockpile goods to mitigate the effects of delays, while 4 per cent have already started doing so.\u0026nbspA fifth of companies said they have looked to make contracts with suppliers more flexible while 21 per cent have sought alternative suppliers outside the EU.\u0026nbspEU leaders aren’t ‘inherently unreasonable’ – the Chequers plan isTory donor threatens to fund new Brexit party after Chequers ‘fiasco’Next says post-Brexit border delays pose biggest threat to business Theresa May’s Salzburg speech could help inch towards a Brexit dealMay says EU proposals on Irish border still \u0027totally unacceptable\u0027May has \u0027failed to find solution\u0027 to prevent hard border in IrelandHalf of UK companies bringing in goods from the EU said they would struggle to find the suppliers and skills they need in this if they were forced to bring production parts of their supply chain here post-Brexit.Almost two fifths (38 per cent) said future trade arrangements are still\u0026nbsptoo unclear for them to prepare at all for Brexit.\u0026nbspJohn Glen, an economist at the CIPS, said the UK economy could “fall off a cliff” as a result of border delays of just 10 minutes.“Businesses have become used to operating efficiently with exceptionally lean, frictionless supply chains, where quick customs clearance is a given, he said.\u0026nbsp“Customs delays would not only affect businesses but would also lead to a shortage of products on shelves and an increase in prices for consumers as well.”Stockpiling is not an option for all firms, he said, because many do not have available storage facilities or simply can’t build up supplies because the items they buy and sell are perishable.“To prevent an economic meltdown, the government must ensure that goods continue to flow seamlessly across the border post-Brexit,” Mr Glen added.\u0026nbspHe said a deal is required quickly because the majority of businesses say they need at least a year to prepare for Brexit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The communications regulator said its research showed that approximately two thirds of mobile customers on monthly bills are on contracts that ‘bundle’ the cost of their handset along with the cost of airtime. However, while this works out as good value for money for most people, the watchdog said a “a significant minority”, estimated at around 1.5 million, continue to pay the same price after the end of their minimum contract period, meaning they are still paying instalments for a handset that has already been paid off. Roaming charges would be \u0027limited\u0027 in no-deal Brexit, government saysRise of the apps sees fall in UK mobile phone callsUK\u0027s best and worst broadband providers, according to OfcomMobile customer to be able to switch providers by text, Ofcom saysOfcom said this happens when providers are not transparent about costs when customers sign up for contracts, which is “unacceptable”. The regulator said it is considering two options to address the problem, the first of which is a requirement for mobile companies to break down the different parts of the mobile package a customer is buying. Another option would be to require providers to automatically introduce “fairer tariffs” at the end of a minimum contract period. Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom consumer group director, said: “Mobile customers should get the best possible deal. We’re concerned that people are not told, or cannot tell, exactly what they are paying for.“So, we are extending our work on behalf of mobile customers to ensure that handset charges are clear and fair – not just when they enter a contract, but also when their minimum period is up.”Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at uSwitch, said: “Ofcom’s calls for greater transparency from mobile providers are welcome. As the watchdog points out, millions of customers are currently paying\u0026nbspmore than they need to for their phone contracts, as they’ve already paid off the cost of the handset but are still forking out the same amount each month. “There are a variety of different deals available to consumers in the market, so making things more transparent across all tariff types is vital, to make it easier to compare handset costs and what really is the best way to get a phone and airtime package.”However, Mr Doku warned that there are concerns that some providers will use the splitting of the cost of the handset and airtime to advocate the new breed of ‘flexi’ tariffs. “While these do separate out the cost of the handset and airtime, the benefits can come at a significant premium to customers who can pay as much as £19m a month on airtime alone,” he said. “In reality, often the cheapest way to own the latest smartphones is to buy one outright, and pair it with one of the really competitive SIM-only deals currently available.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The high street store called on the government to provide more clarity about its planning, to enable it to make suitable arrangements. The company said the “indirect risk of interruption to the smooth operation of our ports represents the biggest risk to our business from Brexit”. UK retail sales better than expected in AugustAccording to Next, there is no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU, but the retailer said that the issue would be the preparedness of UK authorities and businesses.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound. In a bid to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations, Next has secured\u0026nbspexchange rates in US dollars, its most important trading currency, for the next two years. In 2018, the costing rate is $1.29 per £1, and in 2019 the company expects to get $1.33 per £1. In early trading on Tuesday, the pound was at $1.31.

My understanding of the inclusion of socks in the regulations has always been that dark socks must be worn as opposed to brightly coloured ones, not that socks are categorically required, an assumption which clearly turned out to be incorrect.\u0026nbspMy view is that this makes the dress code inherently skewed so that men adhere to the regulations automatically, since men\u0027s shoes are always worn with socks, whereas women need to think carefully about whether an otherwise conventionally smart women\u0027s outfit conforms to the university rules.Eleanor Broome, who studied French at the Russell Group university, said she was also refused entry to her graduation ceremony in July for not wearing socks.Her ceremony was delayed by 15 minutes while students and their family and friends waited for her to come back.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn delivers a keynote speech at the Labour Party Conference in LiverpoolDerby County manager leads the celebrations with players in front of their fans after winning a penalty shootout against Manchester United in the third round of the Carabao Cup.

That tool logs what apps and activities people do with their phone, and presents it all in one easy to use chart.The phone will log whether people are spending all their time on social media, for instance. And it also measures other data like how many notifications arrive and how often owners pick up their phones.Created with Sketch.iPhone XS launch in September 2018 Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

The information will be presented in graphs, and users are offered the ability to ban themselves from specific apps, for instance.But those charts – intended as a way of allowing people to better control their use of their phone – have turned out to be more than a little horrifying to many users. Many appear to have used their last few minutes of available time to tweet about just how miserable their incessant tweeting is making them.Others embraced ignorance as a way of avoiding the horrifying graphs.Many found, however that the feature is actually working – despite or perhaps because of the feelings of shame. The feature was introduced by Apple as a way of allowing people to use their phone for what they actually want to do, which appears to be paying off.One important group affected by the changes are children. Apple allows the Screen Time feature to be controlled within families – meaning, for instance, that parents can set limits for their children, who can ask for more time if they need it.Screen Time is just one of a vast range of features introduced in iOS 12, Apple\u0027s latest iPhone update. They also include other features intended on improving people\u0027s relationship with their phone, including alterations to the way notifications work.The feature should nudge users into using it when the latest update is installed. But if not it can be found by heading into the Settings app, scrolling down to Screen Time, and following the instructions that are found there.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The name is demure the scene, not so much – at least not once they pass the parking lot, the man checking tickets at the front gate and the dim corridor at whose far end blazes a rectangle of bronze sand and sea.Hijabs are unwound from heads, veils tugged from faces. Jeans and abayas evaporate, ulging string bikinis, tankinis and swim shorts. Under spindly cabanas by azure waves, two women lie chest down on lounge chairs, their bare backs implying bare fronts. All around them, gallons of tanning oil glistens on acres of copper skin.When a man on a jet ski buzzes past, a female lifeguard warns him off with a staccato of whistle blasts.“Men,” says Nada, a school bus supervisor from Beirut who was treading the Mediterranean just offshore, “are suffocating.In Lebanon, a sliver of a country on the Mediterranean coast where summer sticks to your skin like moist Saran wrap, the beach is less a luxury than a utility. It is hard to imagine going without.Public and pay-by-the-day beaches line the coast from Tyre in the south to Tripoli in the north, and every other billboard on the highways out of Beirut seems to display a bikini model promoting a tanning aid\u0026nbsp(SPF, evidently, is not in style).But many observant Muslim women consider it haram – forbidden – to expose their bodies in front of men who are not their husbands or, in some cases, close relatives. Other women may cover themselves in deference to conservative families and communities.For them, a mixed-gender beach is to be avoided those who go with their families roast in the sun fully clothed in hijabs and long-sleeved shirts and pants or abayas, the full-length caftans popular among devout Lebanese Muslim women.Hence the emergence of ladies’ beaches like this one, the Bellevue Beach Club in the seaside town of Jiyeh – a salt-tinged hiatus from the male gaze for $18 (£14) a day, just 20 minutes down a trash-perfumed highway from Beirut.AFPGetty)It is a dedicated patch of sand for conservative women amid the cultural melange of Lebanon, which, with its 18 recognised religious sects and vigorous all-night party scene, tends to be more socially liberal than other Arab countries.At the Bellevue, there seemed to be as many different degrees of scanty cladding as there were women. For some women, religious scruples argued for more coverage. For others, style considerations, and the heat, argued for less. Each woman had made her own peace with the proportions.“Here, I’m free to be me,” says Rabab Amhaz, 35, a housewife from the inland Bekaa Valley. She gestures\u0026nbspto her tankini, bright with a teal floral pattern, and shimmies\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspthe water.Seeking a second opinion on her beach visit, she had consulted her brother, a Hezbollah fighter. He had not only given her his blessing but shown her a YouTube video of a Muslim cleric explaining that swimwear was acceptable among women, so long as the women covered their lower bodies.Nada, who began wearing the veil when she married at age 14, dismisses\u0026nbspthis assessment: you could find a cleric to say anything you wanted, she says.Following her own strong conviction that all the skin on display around her was forbidden (who knew who might be watching from one of the boats that periodically splashed by, or from behind the walls of the resort?),\u0026nbspshe had looked at herself in the mirror that morning and changed into a more modest bottom. She also declined to reveal her last name to a reporter, preferring to avoid the prospect of disapproval at home.But a swimsuit was a swimsuit – in this case, a black-and-white patterned swim tank with black shorts.Created with Sketch.Syrian refugee in Lebanon: Education is the foundation of my dreams Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sara, 11, is a Syrian refugee living in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley in an informal tented settlement.

She does\u0026nbspnot want her sons or grandsons to get used to seeing women’s bodies.But still. “I love to swim,” she says, smiling and shrugging, “so I have no other choice.”Nada and Amhaz agree\u0026nbspon one point: absolutely no beach selfies, not even to share with their husbands.“No, no!” they exclaim, high-fiving.Cameras are banned, the better to protect the beachgoers’ modesty and privacy, though cellphones are not. But visits to several other Lebanese resorts, undertaken purely for journalistic purposes, suggest\u0026nbspfew other differences between women-only beaches and mixed ones beyond the obvious.No matter the setting, gossip and hookah pipes scent the air. Snacks, water and shade are at a premium. People-watching is frequently rewarding.Several ladies’ beaches fringe the coastline south of Beirut, their names redolent of sandy glamour around the world (the Laguna the Bondi). The Bellevue Beach Club began offering women-only days in the mid-1990s after veiled women began asking for privacy.Business was good – better than on mixed days, even. It soon went all women, all the time.A man collects tickets, but no other males are allowed. Women staff the restrooms and the pool. The staff includes the Australian and Filipino wives of the brothers who run the Bellevue, who go to mixed beaches together.There is a female DJ for the thatch-roofed poolside cabana where beachgoers undulate, hips exuberantly swaying\u0026nbspto Egyptian singer Sherine Abdel Wahab and Lebanese singer Maya Yazbek.Lebanon, where people from different sects share offices, neighbourhoods and businesses, and crop tops can outnumber hijabs in some Beirut neighbourhoods, might seem like a natural inventor of the ladies’ beach. But women-only hours at the pool or the beach are common in other parts of the Middle East, too, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, where dress codes for local women are more uniformly conservative.At the Bellevue, there are\u0026nbspno religious strictures on swim attire but each woman’s own.Nada’s 21-year-old daughter wears modest gym clothing when she goes to mixed beaches with her husband at the Bellevue, she wore a bikini top with a short swim skirt. She had brought a Syrian friend who, taken aback at the way the other beachgoers dressed, kept a tank top on.Piles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisSteven Spielberg\u0027s The Post banned in LebanonHow to spend a weekend in BeirutThen there was Rana Ghalayini, a nurse from Beirut who had first put on the veil when she was 12, only to remove it because her family thought she was too young.

The communications regulator said its research showed that approximately two thirds of mobile customers on monthly bills are on contracts that ‘bundle’ the cost of their handset along with the cost of airtime. However, while this works out as good value for money for most people, the watchdog said a “a significant minority”, estimated at around 1.5 million, continue to pay the same price after the end of their minimum contract period, meaning they are still paying instalments for a handset that has already been paid off. Roaming charges would be \u0027limited\u0027 in no-deal Brexit, government saysRise of the apps sees fall in UK mobile phone callsUK\u0027s best and worst broadband providers, according to OfcomMobile customer to be able to switch providers by text, Ofcom saysOfcom said this happens when providers are not transparent about costs when customers sign up for contracts, which is “unacceptable”. The regulator said it is considering two options to address the problem, the first of which is a requirement for mobile companies to break down the different parts of the mobile package a customer is buying. Another option would be to require providers to automatically introduce “fairer tariffs” at the end of a minimum contract period. Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom consumer group director, said: “Mobile customers should get the best possible deal. We’re concerned that people are not told, or cannot tell, exactly what they are paying for.“So, we are extending our work on behalf of mobile customers to ensure that handset charges are clear and fair – not just when they enter a contract, but also when their minimum period is up.”Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at uSwitch, said: “Ofcom’s calls for greater transparency from mobile providers are welcome. As the watchdog points out, millions of customers are currently paying\u0026nbspmore than they need to for their phone contracts, as they’ve already paid off the cost of the handset but are still forking out the same amount each month. “There are a variety of different deals available to consumers in the market, so making things more transparent across all tariff types is vital, to make it easier to compare handset costs and what really is the best way to get a phone and airtime package.”However, Mr Doku warned that there are concerns that some providers will use the splitting of the cost of the handset and airtime to advocate the new breed of ‘flexi’ tariffs. “While these do separate out the cost of the handset and airtime, the benefits can come at a significant premium to customers who can pay as much as £19m a month on airtime alone,” he said. “In reality, often the cheapest way to own the latest smartphones is to buy one outright, and pair it with one of the really competitive SIM-only deals currently available.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The high street store called on the government to provide more clarity about its planning, to enable it to make suitable arrangements. The company said the “indirect risk of interruption to the smooth operation of our ports represents the biggest risk to our business from Brexit”. UK retail sales better than expected in AugustAccording to Next, there is no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU, but the retailer said that the issue would be the preparedness of UK authorities and businesses.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound. In a bid to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations, Next has secured\u0026nbspexchange rates in US dollars, its most important trading currency, for the next two years. In 2018, the costing rate is $1.29 per £1, and in 2019 the company expects to get $1.33 per £1. In early trading on Tuesday, the pound was at $1.31. Next said its decision to hedge exposure to the pound meant\u0026nbspit was not expecting any cost price inflation over the next 18 months.

The group now expects retail sales to account for less than half of group sales for the year in full. Pre-tax profit edged up by 0.5 per cent to £311m.

Those microorganisms could have been able to survive for hundreds of millions of years on the ancient planet.“We showed, based on basic physics and chemistry calculations, that the ancient Martian subsurface likely had enough dissolved hydrogen to power a global subsurface biosphere,” said Jesse Tarnas, a graduate student at Brown University and lead author of the study published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters. “Conditions in this habitable zone would have been similar to places on Earth where underground life exists.”Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

They cannot get energy from sunlight, so instead peel electrons off molecules in the environments that surround them.Nasa reveals what it plans to do with water on the MoonAround four billion years ago, Mars would have had the same conditions that sustain huge numbers of microbes down on Earth today.The researchers are clear that the findings don\u0027t definitively mean that alien life existed on Mars. But they are important evidence that if life did get started there it would have been able to sustain itself.By combining\u0026nbspa range of different data about the red planet, scientists found that it probably had a habitable zone that stretched for kilometres deep and all around the world. It would have existed for hundreds of millions of years.Scientists now hope the findings can be used to inform future trips to Mars that will attempt to find evidence of alien life.“The mission of the 2020 rover is to look for the signs of past life,” Mustard said. “Areas where you may have remnants of this underground habitable zone — which may have been the largest habitable zone on the planet — seem like a good place to target.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Everyone is waiting to see how the Tory conference will pan out next week – will they even be negotiating with May by the end of the year?On the eve of the Salzburg summit it looked like a deal on the Irish border might be closer\u0026nbspfor months it had been the main sticking point. But just as compromise seemed close on Ireland, the future relationship issue has reared its head again and looks intractable.\u0026nbspTo those in Brussels the UK’s moves in negotiations appear inexplicable, offering terms that have already been ruled out well in advance.For a deal on the future relationship, the prime minister would have to back down completely and either ditch her red lines and go for a Norway-style, close relationship, or accept she’s only going to get a Canada-style free trade agreement. But she lacks political room for manoeuvre in Westminster and dug herself in even further on Tuesday, effectively ruling out the only offer on the table from the EU.The EU does not really see this as a negotiation: one clued-up Brussels observer described the EU’s approach to me as Britain’s “managed capitulation”. It summarises the situation\u0026nbspwell: for progress to be made Ms May would have to accept that Chequers is dead – as everyone in Brussels already sees it.But there seems to be no sign of that happening. The prime minister said it was unacceptable for the EU to reject her plan without offering a counter-offer, but the response in Brussels is simple: “Or what?”\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It is not about leadership squabbles or parliamentary posturing.“If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people’s rights at work and environmental and consumer standards – then we will support that sensible deal. A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.”Brexit customs delays of 30 minutes ‘could bankrupt one in 10 firms’Brexit transition period could be too short, Merkel warnsAt conference, Tories like me are fighting for a final say on BrexitBarclays boss says cards post a bigger risk than Brexit. Is he right?Do we have Obama and Blair to thank for Trump and Brexit?UK will be ‘unequivocally pro-business’ after Brexit, May saysThe comment took a different tone from the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir who gave a heavy signal in his own speech that Labour would oppose any deal Ms May brings back, as it would be unlikely to meet the party’s six tests.They include one that the prime minister’s deal should deliver the exact the same benefits as the single market and customs union, but they were not referred to by Mr Corbyn.The leader’s language potentially represents an attempt to maintain unity, by signalling to Labour voters who backed Leave that the party is not trying to wreck Brexit, despite its policies shifting towards stronger support for a new referendum this week.At the same time Labour strategists will be aware that any sign that Ms May would work with Mr Corbyn to get her plans through parliament, would enrage Tory Brexiteers who are attempting to push her into a more eurosceptic position.The speech was peppered with standing ovations for Mr Corbyn from his supporters, with none louder than during the section in which he gave full-throated support for the Palestinian cause.Created with Sketch.Labour Party conference 2018: in pictures Show all 24Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Leader Jeremy Corbyn addresses a pre-conference

conference in Liverpool on SundayBut he also dedicated a significant section of his speech to an attempt to put an end to the months long antisemitism crisis that even Labour insiders accept has damaged their party’s reputation.\u0026nbspCiting how he recently visited the former Nazi concentration camp at Terezin, he said: “I say this to all in the Jewish community – this party, this movement, will always be implacable campaigners against antisemitism and racism in all its forms. We are your ally.“And the next Labour government will guarantee whatever support necessary to ensure the security of Jewish community centres and places of worship, as we will for any other community experiencing hateful behaviour and physical attacks.”He also used the section to launch an attack on Ms May’s ‘hostile environment’ policies which he branded a “shameful brainchild of the present prime minister” that led to the Windrush scandal and lashed out at Conservative support for the far-right government of Hungary’s Viktor Orban.Another broadside was saved for Boris Johnson whom he accused of islamophobia and “dog whistle jibes”, following his articles containing offensive comments about burqas, niqabs and suicide vests.Underlining the leftwing agenda set out by his party this week – more free childcare, worker representation on boards and shareholding, public ownership, an expansion in green energy and a second-homes tax – he said only radical policies could now stop populism and xenophobia taking hold.But he had a clear message for delegates in the hall who have squabbled over how to move forward: “If we are to get the chance to put those values into practice in government we are going to need unity to do it.\u0026nbsp“Our movement has achieved nothing when ided. The only winners have been the rich and the party of the rich, the Conservatives.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchApparently focusing in particular on the ferocity and aggression that has characterised internal Labour rows in recent weeks, Mr Corbyn said: “Real unity is based on the freedom to disagree and debate and then come together around democratic decisions, as we have done this week.\u0026nbsp“So we need to foster a much greater culture of tolerance. An end to abuse, online and in person. We must learn to listen a bit more, and shout a lot less.”Brandon Lewis MP, chairman of the Conservative Party, responded to the speech by saying Mr Corbyn had shown “at every turn he is unfit to govern”.He went on: “All he offers are failed ideas that didn’t work in the past and would leave working families paying the price with higher taxes, more debt and more waste – just like last time.“He confirmed Labour are opening the door to re-running the referendum, which would take us all back to square one.“And he didn’t even apologise to Jewish people for his total failure to tackle the anti-Jewish racism that is rife in the Labour Party.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Only our current deal with the EU can meet those tests.That\u0027s why the only way out of this mess is to call a People\u0027s Vote with the option to stay.

This is a complete and utter farce. We must work to actually improve our nation for all the people in this country.Since Thatcher brought in free trade with Europe, that is when things went downhill.

What is a Harvest Moon? Does it have a spiritual meaning?For example, those born in winter and early spring months are more likely to suffer from schizophrenia, while those who were born from April through to July have an increased chance of being dyslexic, he said.The psychiatrist also rounded up global studies to conclude that the month in which you are born does effect your personality, as astrology and horoscopes do.Dr Hayden wrote in a blog post for website Psychology Today: \u0026ldquoA Japanese study found that people born December through February have lower agreeableness (this term has a precise definition to personality psychologists).\u0026ldquoA Swedish study found that (at least in women), FebruaryMarchApril birthdays led to increased novelty-seeking behaviour.\u0026ldquoAnother study reported that summer-born males are less conscientious (another term with a formal meaning).While this theory does not necessarily support astrology, Dr Hayden adds, it does add evidence that horoscope could potentially based on real science.He added: \u0026ldquoWhen someone says there\u0027s no possible way the month you are born could have any influence on your personality, they aren\u0027t exactly correct.

Until now, Jezza — a staunch Bennite eurosceptic — has resisted any move to overturn Brexit. Yesterday, in a remarkable U-turn, he vowed to accept whatever delegates say.So abject surrender to the mob is the price he will pay to destroy Theresa May. “I enjoy being leader,” he said yesterday. “I am carrying on as leader of the Labour Party because I want to win an election.”His persistence in the face of scathing personal ratings is the only glint of sunlight for stricken Tories.Under any other leader, even snooty wannabe Emily Thornberry, Labour would be miles ahead.But we have learned not to underestimate Corbyn.The People’s Vote movement probably has the numbers in Parliament to vote down any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels.These so-called “moderates”, including the slippery Peter Mandelson, leadership flop David Miliband and decrepit Vince Cable, should be careful what they wish for.In normal times, the Tories would beat off the Momentum marauders. But for all her brave talk in Downing Street last week, Mrs May is a real political liability.She destroyed both her credibility and her majority in last year’s unforced contest.The public mood on Brexit is volatile and unpredictable.Most people believe the majority for Brexit, fuelled by EU arrogance and plain bad manners, could actually grow. But nobody’s sure.A snap election would focus the public’s attention on the choice between a clean break and a botched compromise which will never be acceptable to all sides.It could cauterise the issue which still ides families and friends. Or it could backfire badly.Tory Brexiteers must think hard before pulling the plug on the Maybot. It could split their party asunder.But so could Jeremy Corbyn’s rank opportunism.Blairite Labour moderates must soon choose.If they help Jeremy Corbyn win a vote of no confidence, what do they do next?Will they campaign for a party whose rampant extremists wish them dead? Will they stay silent while Momentum activists unseat their moderate comrades?Can deputy Tom Watson support a leader whose own MPs need round-the-clock armed guards against his dangerously fanatical supporters?Can they ignore threats of rape and torture? Nothing is too extreme or too petty for these thugs. They even want ex-Labour luvvie Maureen Lipman sacked from Corrie for attacking their Beloved Leader.Anyone who thinks images of Marxist anarchy are far-fetched should listen to Corbyn sidekick Dawn Butler praising the 1980s Militant Tendency — the forerunner to Momentum — which almost bankrupted Merseyside.“We are in Liverpool where over 30 years ago the council stood up to Thatcher and said, better to break the law than break the poor,” she ranted.That was when Labour split asunder for the first time, creating a new Social Democrat party which posed a short-lived threat the Tories.Roy Hattersley, deputy leader in those turbulent times, warns the party could split again today. “All we need is for one of the hard-working, long-suffering MPs to be kicked out and the whole thing will blow up in our faces,” he said yesterday.The Tories just need to be patient.Albanian drug gangs are gaining market share from Bulgarians, Romanians and Colombians by slashing cocaine prices.Police arrested a record 4,000 peddlers operating across county lines, mostly too young to charge.Kne crime among Somalis, Eritreans and Nigerians is soaring.Meanwhile, there’s a growth spurt in modern slavery.Organised crime is a multi-billion-pound industry affecting “more UK citizens, more often, than any other national security threat,” says the National Crime Agency.All despite Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Deal, or no dough.LABOUR’S position on Brexit is clear as mud, but we know one thing they do believe: the Press needs muzzling.From the moment Jeremy Corbyn told us that “change is coming”, the media has come under attack after attack from a leader who is playing the man — not the ball — when it comes to those asking him legitimate questions.Union strongman Len McCluskey accused the media of “vicious attacks” on the Labour Party.But it’s not an “attack” to ask Corbyn, a man who wants to be PM, why he spent his holidays visiting a terrorists’ cemetery in Tunisia or why he invited the IRA for tea and treats in Parliament.Nor is it just the tactics of the hated “mainstream media” to ask John McDonnell whether his extremist economics will actually work in the real world..Today’s announcement on employee ownership appears appealing for workers, but it would only hit investment and productivity in the long-term.If this Labour Party gains power, the free Press — and the economy — would be in serious danger.IS Anthony Joshua now the UK’s most impressive sportsman?His win over Alexander Povetkin at a packed-out Wembley was stunning.It’s now on to Fury and Wilder.Beat those two, and he might go down as Britain’s best ever boxer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I think we’re going to get on.”She was right. We did. The other panellists liked her too.Predominantly mothers, we treated her as one might a naughty niece you were particularly fond of, rolling our eyes and smiling affectionately as she regaled us with the latest relationship drama in her le.But despite her no-nonsense, often humorous delivery, there was always a faint “here we go again” sadness behind her eyes and, as I saw it, a low self-esteem that might explain the constant cosmetic alterations and propensity to criticise herself before anyone else could.After reading the recent headlines of wild nights out and rap songs about cocaine, it’s easy to think that Katie is a party girl who has largely abandoned her children as an inconvenience to the carefree lestyle she longs to have.And, judging by yesterday’s letters page, plenty of you do.Before getting to know her, I might have shared that view. But now I see her admittedly destructive behaviour as a cry for help and I’m relieved that, finally, she’s in to rehab to get it.Once, in a rare flash of what I feel is the real Katie, she told me that her Holy Grail was to find a decent, dependable man who could pay the bills while she stayed home and ran a large, chaotic farmhouse full of children and animals.Her favourite night of the week was Friday, when she would wipe off her “work face”, slip in to her old trackie bottoms and call in a takeaway for her, her now estranged third husband Kieran and the kids.Anyone who has seen her interacting with Harvey, her severely disabled eldest son, will know that she’s a fundamentally devoted mother doing her best  in often trying circumstances.Remember her in the I’m A Celebrity jungle? Free of make-up, her hair in braids, tackling each challenge with an admirably no-nonsense bravado? To my mind, that’s the real Katie — the rest is just noise.But without doubt, she has a self-destructive streak when she feels let down.So, after catching Kieran having an affair with her “best friend”, forgiving him, then catching him again with someone else, it was inevitable that a fall was coming. Her mum Amy said at the weekend: “Kate has been her own worst enemy and behaved like an idiot at times but she has been tearing herself apart for years.“All the men in her le have used Katie, and never, ever leave her alone . . . Kieran almost destroyed Kate with his behaviour, Alex  has been as bad, and Pete  likes to portray himself as perfect . . . they all know that  they wind her up, she will react.“Kate is stupid for reacting, but these men need to look at how they are behaving and take some responsibility.”Wise words. And Katie needs to heed them as much as her former husbands.She’s always been disarmingly frank about the incidents in her le that would have sent many of us over the edge — not least being sexually abused when she was just six years old. But now it’s time for her to stop shrugging them off as “just one of those things” and take a long, hard look at how they’ve shaped her often destructive behaviour patterns as an adult.I hope she sticks with the therapy and, ultimately, finds contentment.HOT on the stilettos of Stormy Daniels’ lurid description of Donald Trump’s manhood, singer Cher has been regaling us with tales of her former lovers.Tom Cruise is in her “top five” but legendary lothario Warren Beatty was, apparently, a disappointment.Cher, 72, explains: “Not that he wasn’t technically good, but I didn’t feel anything.”We remain blissfully unaware of whether she means emotionally or physically.EAGLE-EYED travellers boarding a flight operated by Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacic noticed this glaring spelling error on the side of the plane.Though it grieves me greatly, spelling errors or “typos” are now commonplace in everyday exchanges via text, tweet or email, but it never ceases to amaze me when they’re writ large on something as expensive as a sign, billboard or, er, Boeing 747.Does no one check these things before literally advertising their ignorance? Seems not.And so, we are entertained by such gems as Shoplters Will Be Prostituted, Chris Is Risen, All Busniesses Open As Usual, Pay and Display Apples In This Area, Costumers Only, Parrallel Parking, No Trough Road and Pedestrain Crossing, to name but a few.And don’t even get me started on missing or misplaced apostraffy’s…WHEN cookery presenter Nadiya Hussain was picked to bake the Queen’s birthday cake in 2016, she recalls feeling that it was an opportunity to act against Islamophobia.“Everybody thinks it, ‘Oh God, who let the Muslim woman near the Queen with a kne?’” she says now. “Let’s address that elephant in the room, because they did.”Nope. Actually, I remember thinking, “Oh, it’s that lovely woman who won Bake Off and made Mary Berry cry tears of joy”.Sorry to disappoint, Nadiya.Quite right too.Particularly as the majority of them are now more recognisable than the “celebrities” they’re dancing with.HOLLYWOOD director Sam Mendes says his now defunct marriage to Kate Winslet struggled because he “was not very comfortable being married to a celebrity . . . it made me feel self-conscious”.Couldn’t he have worked that out before they trotted down the aisle?VIDEO game designers are working on giving avatars real-le emotions to make the experience more authentic.Will they include a frustrated parent yelling: “Get off that bloody thing before you turn in to someone with the physical and people skills of an atrophied three-toed sloth?No, thought not.ACTRESS Helena Bonham Carter says she used a psychic to contact Princess Margaret so she could perfect her role as the Queen’s sister in the forthcoming third series of The Crown.She claims Margaret told her she’s “doing a great job”.Hmmm. From what little one knows of the feisty royal, “fack orf” seems more likely.FRANK SPRINGETT is 91, his we Mary is 86 and they have been married for 67 years.Frank is deaf and suffers from arthritis, Mary has severe Alzheimer’s, and both are being looked after in the same Warwickshire-based care home using funds from the sale of their house.However, the money is now running low and while social services will continue to partially pay for Mary’s care, it says former factory worker Frank has to look after himself.Meaning that 70 years after they met, they face being separated for the first time.“We fear  they are torn apart, the strain will kill them,” says their daughter Joanne, 57.With seemingly endless funds being readily shelled out to help accommodate those  who seek asylum in Britain, how sad that someone who has paid in to the system all their le gets so let down when they need it most.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

while calling for the National Anthem to be scrapped, and comparing the royals to the Kardashians.The tirade comes just days after the Duchess of Sussex launched a new initiative to help victims of the Grenfell Tower disaster who live in the MP’s constituency.Speaking at the Labour conference in Liverpool, Ms Dent Coad also:The Corbynista MP laid in to the royal family at a fringe meeting hosted by pressure group Labour For A Republic.She claimed the Grenfell “atrocity” has turned the public against the status quo by exposing inequality across the UK.Ms Dent Coad then said: “I know some people find it really encouraging when members of the royal family support local charities - people have told me ‘So and so came in, they helped us with this, and it was really encouraging.’“I don’t have any problem with that at all, but when the cameras are gone let’s remember those volunteers are back doing 99 per cent of the work completely unsung, completely unappreciated.“Their support is important to some, not to others, but its peripheral.”Last week Prince Harry’s we Meghan launched a charity cookbook written with the survivors of Grenfell Tower.She took her mum Doria and Harry to meet the women who wrote recipes for the book at an event at Kensington Palace -

So she pays tax on that, nothing else, just that.“She doesnt pay tax on anything else. And as we know she also has some money offshore, so thats disappointing.”In fact, the monarch voluntarily pays tax on all her private income whatever its source.Ms Dent Coad has a track record of angry rants at the royal family.At the same event at last year’s Labour conference, she sparked fury by claiming Prince Harry is unable to fly a helicopter.EMMA Dent Coad became Kensington’s first Labour MP at last year’s General Election, winning the seat by just 20 votes.But she is a longstanding opponent of her constituency’s best-known residents -

and thats the most dangerous thing about them, with the possibility of sustaining a head injury from falling, choking on vomit or getting alcohol poisoning.But  your mates still compus mentus, then it can be tricky to tell whether theyre approaching blackout mode or not.Theres no definitive guide to blacking out - symptoms can dfer from person to person, or session by session.But common signs that someones very drunk include poor coordination, vomiting or needing help to get home.However there are some signs to watch out for, including:Source: American Addiction Centres“Slurred speech is also common, and people are sensitive to that it’s why police use it as a test,” explained Koob.“Also, same with motor coordination. They might be bumping into things. It’s hard to walk in a straight line when you’re that intoxicated.”A change in personality is also a pretty good indicator, Koob said.One marker I use is dramatic and rapid swings in emotionality.“One moment, your friend might be praising you and telling you how much they care. The next, they turn, and it’s the complete opposite emotion, like anger directed at you.”Its an obvious answer but the key is to drink in moderation - both to protect your dignity and your long-term health.According to Alcohol Concern, excessive drinking is the biggest risk factor for death, ill-health and disability among 15-49 year-olds in the UK - and is the fth biggest factor among all ages.To reduce your chances of developing a whole host of potentially fatal diseases, Public Health England is encouraging middle-aged drinkers to have at least two days a week off the booze.A study from the University of Calornia, San Diego, claimed to have found that around 40 per cent of brains are more prone to blackouts from booze and drugs than others.Well, its all to do with ethanol - a compound found in alcohol.Drinking up to four boozy drinks in a short space of time can heighten its effects - particularly  youve not eaten much.When the stomach is empty, ethanol reaches the blood as soon as half an hour after consumption.That means that as you drink, your blood ethanol level inches high and higher for up to 90 minutes - possibly without realising just how drunk you are until youre already pretty far gone.After a couple of hours on the sauce, that ethanol then dfuses from the blood into the brain.The booze then targets receptors in the part of the brain which controls emotions and recollection, including something called the gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA.When GABA receptors are affected by alcohol, the brain stops transmitting signals that would otherwise solidy memories.It also helps the brain to start producing things like dopamine and serotonin, as well as glutamate - the neurotransmitter that results in your feeling calmer.Thats why you often feel amazing when youre drinking...so you drink more - all the while getting increasingly leathered.But that can also lead to you doing things which are out of character. As your inhibitions go down with that fth G\u0026ampT, you start to think that dancing on the tables a good idea, that sexting your boss is totally legit.And the next day, you cant understand why your boss is looking at you oddly from across the office, or why youre covered in bruises from falling off the table.Its not just the damage to your ego thats the problem - blacking out means that youre drinking to excess, and that comes with all the usual health issues associated with drinking, including developing liver problems, heart disease and ious cancers."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437078059.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"639\" width=\"960","title":"jeremy corbyn speech labour party conference 2018","story":"The hard left leader used his conference speech to party faithful to try to persuade Britain that he is now ready to lead the nation.The 69 year-old doubled down on his Socialist agenda by branding a series of new radical policies “the new political mainstream”.And the party boss claimed that next year’s annual party gathering in September 2019 would meet “as a Labour government”.Mr Corbyn, 69, told the audience in Liverpool that his left wing mass movement in now “ready to take charge”.And he instructed them: “We must take our message to every town, city and village. United and ready to win, ready to govern as we were in 1945, 1964 and 1997.“Let every constituency, every community know Labour is ready.”But at the same time, he also issued an appeal to his bitterly ided party’s Labour’s squabbling factions to unite.Calling on warring MPs and members to “focus on what unites us”, he pleaded: “We need to foster a much greater culture of tolerance. An end to abuse, online and in person.“We must learn to listen a bit more, and shout a lot less.”Mr Corbyn also admitted the summer had been “tough”, after he was repeatedly rocked by an MPs’ revolt over accusations that he held anti-Semitic views.But while admitting that the row “caused immense hurt and anxiety in the Jewish community”, the Labour boss refused to use his major platform to offer Jews another apology.Instead, he only added: “I hope we can work together to draw a line under it”.Mr Corbyn highlighted a series of new policy announcements made through out the four day gathering on Merseyside that have driven Labour even further to the left.They included forcing companies to hand over 10% of their worth to employees, and workers’ takeover of board rooms.He poured fresh scorn on bankers for “piling up profits around the world”.And when the Labour scornfully mentioned Theresa May’s bid to ensire the UK has the lowest corporation tax rates of all the G20 nations, the enterprise-boosting offer was booed by the packed hall.The Labour boss also issued his regular Trump-style rant at the media.JEREMY Corbyn’s speech today drew derision from the Tories - who said his plans would drown Britain in debt and risk betraying Brexit.And Jewish groups criticised the Labour leader for not explaining how he will tackle anti-Semitism. Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis said: Jeremy Corbyn has shown at every turn he is unfit to govern. All he offers are failed ideas that didnt work in the past and would leave working families paying the price with higher taxes, more debt and more waste - just like last time.He confirmed Labour are opening the door to re-running the referendum, which would take us all back to square one.And he didnt even apologise to Jewish people for his total failure to tackle the anti-Jewish racism that is re in the Labour Party.Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, added: “Jeremy Corbyn’s words mean nothing until Labour takes the necessary steps to deal with anti-Semitism in its ranks.“Words have long ceased to be enough. Actions are what matter.”Unions cheered his proposals for greater state control of industry - but business groups expressed caution.The director general of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, warned that policy built on ideology and diktat would harm those who can least afford it by driving down investment, productivity and pay.Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said: While weve heard some welcome commitments from the Labour Party in the past few days, it should more readily acknowledge the social contribution of businesses across the UK.And free-market think-tanks were also critical - Mark Littlewood of the IEA said: “Jeremy Corbyn is right to highlight that parts of the establishment have far too much control over Britain’s economy.“Westminster’s elite should not be picking winners and losers in business, or deciding whose jobs have guaranteed funding from the taxpayer.“Yet his proposals today – including the creation of 400,000 green energy jobs and increased centralisation of the National Health Service - imagine a Britain in which consumer choice is further limited, and more services are controlled by a select few in Whitehall.” John O’Connell of the Taxpayers’ Alliance added: Corbyns angry rant offered nothing to the hard-pressed, silent majority of taxpayers who want to be trusted to spend their own money and care for their children as they see fit - without being clobbered by even more cruel punishment taxes.” While pledging to protect press freedom, the then immediately insisted: “Freedom here too often means the freedom to spread lies and half truths and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful”.And he heaped praise in Spanish on his Mexican-born we Laura Alez, telling her from the podium: “Tu eres mi fuerza y mi apoyo. Gracias Laurita ”.Business leaders reacted with horror, with the BCC saying his leftwing package would inflict “a serious impact on business confidence, investment and growth, which ultimately would hurt the very people and communities that need support the most”.Its Director General Adam Marshall added: “While there were some bright spots, Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business, big and small alike”.But unions firebrands loved Mr Corbyn’s 70 minute-long diarribe. Unite general secretary ‘Red Len’ McCluskey dubbed it “*inspiring”.PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka added: Today Jeremy has set out a transformative and radical socialist vision for the country”.Veteran leftwing Labour MP Dennis Skinner was left jubilant, telling the hall: “I want to nationalise something every week”.Tory chairman Brandon Lewis said Mr Corbyn had showed that “at every turn he is unfit to govern”.It was his traditional blend of bile, fantasy and lies, falteringly recited in his two stock voices — all hammily-acted phoney compassion one moment, ­sudden exaggerated rage the next.He turned his ire first on Tories, then on a critical Press. This, he insisted, would remain free under Labour — but not just to print what it liked. Thick as he is, ­Corbyn sees no contradiction.Then it was on to Jezza curing all our ills with freebies galore and mass job creation, all presumably funded by the same tax on the rich. Since Labour aides now privately admit their 2017 manesto secretly covered up a £1TRILLION bill, Corbyn’s assurances aren’t worth the autocue they are written on.This smug, cocky Labour conference is an annual reminder of just what a dishonest rabble they now are. Sickeningly posing as defenders of the dispossessed while plotting to annul their Brexit votes with a second referendum, brought about by orchestrating chaos.One moronic MP even demanded a General Strike to oust the Government. Frontbencher Richard Burgon stood and applauded. And he is the “next Secretary of State for Justice”, God help us.Corbyn is keen to rebrand his extremism as mainstream in an era when capitalism has “failed”. It is, in reality, a dog-eared hard-left roadmap to ruin on a scale we have never experienced. A Britain which would kill ambition and enterprise and drive out successful firms by stealing their property. Where investors would fear to tread and from which anyone who could would flee.Labour’s candidate for PM is a dim, vain, vindictive, unapologetically anti­Semitic ball of rage who loathes scrutiny, lies habitually about his true beliefs and past terrorist connections and is, his aides admit, “not good in the mornings”.But the Tories must not mistake all that for a free pass. Corbyn’s plans have traction only because the Government has left the battlefield. Theresa May and Philip Hammond are timid tinkerers when we need radical steps to put more money in pockets and make homes affordable. Socialism is the last thing we need.Next to last are Tory “Corbyn-lite” tax rises. Record job figures, low inflation and interest rates add up to a society and economy far healthier than the dystopia of chippy Corbynite imaginations.But  the Tories don’t fix the problems that DO exist they’re sunk, and Britain too.Mr Lewis added: “All he offers are failed ideas that didn’t work in the past and would leave working families paying the price with higher taxes, more debt and more waste – just like last time.“He didn’t even apologise to Jewish people for his total failure to tackle the anti-Jewish racism that is re in the Labour Party.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000003394007.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british oap sleep rough russian airport two weeks","story":"In a story which has been compared to the 2004 Tom Hanks movie The Terminal, Steve Beard was banned from flying to London and was forced to wash in toilets at the travel hub.His journey to Russia began a decade ago, when he fell in love with schoolteacher Ruslana Lesyuta, then aged 42, on a dating site and moved to a village in Siberia to be with her.The Brit, who has a son Robert, eight, with his we, had intended to fly briefly back to the UK to sort out his pension payments.Steve, a former metal worker, lives in the remote Irkutsk region where winter temperatures plummet to minus 50C or below.His we claims he has struggled to adapt to le in Russia, has failed to learn the language and is unemployed.He flew to Moscow but was then barred from leaving the country at Sheremetyevo airport because his Russian residency permit had expired.“They stopped me and did not let me fly out of the country,” he told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.“I was fined. And the migration service urgent me to  to Irkutsk.”Instead, Beard - who worked for 30 years in a London metals plant - flew to Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg to try and leave the country.But again he was told he could not pass through immigration and fly back to Blighty.In despair, Steve stayed in the terminal Pulkovo without money or a bank card.It was only due to help from a Russian tourism official who felt his plight was like the character played by Oscar winning actor Hanks in The Terminal that he was rescued from his ordeal.The Steven Spielberg-directed movie tells the story of an Eastern European man who becomes stranded at New York’s JFK airport after his native country is embroiled in a military coup.And just like Hanks’ character, Steve was forced to wash in the airport bathrooms and eat fast food at the restaurants in the travel hub.The Brit said: “I slept in an chair in the waiting room. I washed my face and hair in the restrooms.“I ate the cheapest food at airport diners. I do not speak Russian, so I could not earn any money here.”He pleaded from help from the British consulate and was lucky to find Ilya Tarashkevich - a sympathetic worker in the St Petersburg tourist information bureau.Ilya said: “Steve approached me and asked how a foreigner can receive a money transfer.“He did not have a card, and the bank did not work with foreigners. My colleagues and I were puzzled.“Soon I realised that the only way was to use my card.”He took pity on a man labelled an “alien” who “had not eaten for three days”.Ilya continued: “I thought what should happen in a persons le to make this happen.“Then Beard also said that he was afraid that he would be banned from entering the country again.“The most important thing in his le is his child.

These are £200 bags. It takes some force to break the wheels and crush them like that.The contractor for a flight simulator firm claims his iPad screen was cracked so he lodged a Swissports customer service desk.He said: They said it wasnt damaged enough for them to do anything and wed have to contact Etihad.We were trying to explain how dficult the wheels would make our train journey. They just didnt care.Michelle Knight also shared pictures of her broken bag after travelling to Almeria, Spain, from Manchester Airport.And Hannah Henry, 21, from Stockport, flew back from Palma in Spain on June 26 to find her bag was destroyed.She said: I noticed straight away when it came off the conveyor. There was a big crack down one side.Hannah has now had to fight through Tui to get her bag replaced - and she said she had to settle for a lesser version of the original.A Swissport spokesman said: “We take our baggage handling responsibilities very seriously and we handle all complaints on a case by case basis.”It comes after Elizabeth posted the shocking footage online when she noticed her own case slide off the trailer and onto the floor with the force it is thrown.She can be heard saying thats mine yeah, as her pink suitcase topples to the ground - while the workers colleague looks on.The 28-year-old, from Bury, told the Manchester Evening News: Im very angry and shocked. It was a new case. The case is dented and the protective layer has been torn off it.The Swissport worker can be seen chucking bags onto the trailer without looking, and only stops to scoop up the fallen cases after five had hit the ground.A Manchester Airport spokeswoman said: “We are disappointed to see this unacceptable handling of bags by a Swissport employee and have raised this with them directly.”Meanwhile, a £1,000 guitar case made from the same material as a Boeing 787 was destroyed by easyJet baggage handlers.John Challis posted footage of him picking up the indestructible carbon fibre case in Berlin to discover it had gouges and cracks in it.EasyJet have apologised for the incident and say they are looking into the issue."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437030212.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"family visit one thousand wetherspoons ten year pub crawl","story":"The Latchfords have spent 10 years touring Britain and Ireland and were first through the door at the chains latest opening in Somerset last week.They ticked off 900 in the first six years but were so prolic they have since had to wait for new ones to open.The only existing bars they havent been to yet are the two beyond security at Heathrows Terminal 5 - which they plan to attend the next time they go on holiday.Their odyssey began with a throwaway promise that mum Sheila, 61, made to son Christy, then 17, which, due to his autism, he took literally and held them to.Sheila, of Kidderminster, said: Our daughter Amy works at the Penny and Black Wetherspoon in Kidderminster and when she started Christy was not yet 18.We wanted to take him in to show her working behind the bar but in those days they had a really strict rule which meant anyone under 18 had to have a meal.We had just eaten so left. I said rather foolishly, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, dont worry, when you are 18 we will go to all of them.When you say something like that to someone with autism it is taken seriously. The minute he turned 18 he was back in the Penny and Black in Kidderminster.We were never intending to do them all, but had promised him and he wouldnt let us forget it.It didnt occur to us it could be doable until I had to go to Scotland to work. They drove me up and we went to ones in Dundee and Edinburgh and it just went from there.The chain currently has around 900 pubs open across the UK but some of the ones the Latchford family have previously visited have since closed.Sheila, husband Keith, 63, and Christy took six years to do the first 900 but in the last four years they have had to wait for new ones to open.The family did all the local area ones first around the Midlands which they could get to in a day and back, before focusing on big cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol and London whilst also enjoying some sightseeing.They have been to every corner of the UK and to Ireland three times to do all the Wetherspoon pubs in both Northern and Southern Ireland.Sheila, a part-time civil servant, added: It was a lot easier when there were loads to do, we could just fly up to Glasgow and walk around and come straight back.We would often book the night away, next week we are going to the new one in St Pancreas when it opens.We only target openings now and keep a close eye on the website and are part of the Wetherspoon appreciation society group on Facebook.The only ones we have not been to are the ones in Heathrow terminal 5 which are after security. We will have to do that when we plan our next holiday.But as far as we know we have done every other one in the UK and Southern Ireland.The family reached the 1,000 milestone when they were first through the door at the opening of the Palladium Electric in Midsomer Norton, Somerset, last week.The latest one in Midsomer Norton was our 1,000th, Sheila said. They dont serve Champagne anymore but we had a nice bottle of sparkling wine instead.It was a real landmark but unfortunately we were only there for a limited time but had a good look around.Sheila says their orders y from coffees to pints and on around half the 1,000 occasions they have added either a breakfast or evening meal to their visit.She added: We really like them and always make a beeline for them even  they are ones we have been to before.The prices are very reasonable but we also love the surroundings. They refurbish a lot of old buildings and there are lots of converted churches, banks, theatres etc.Probably the old Caley picture house in Edinburgh is our favourite but there are so many really good ones.We also all really like the Cabot Court hotel in Weston-super-Mare which is right on the seafront.Keith, a full time carer for Christy, now 28, said: Everyone tends to say that the historical buildings are the best, and that is true.There are some beautul conversions of old premises and some of the newer pubs in particular are fantastic.It is a great hobby for us together and Christy loves it.Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin congratulated the family on their achievement.He said: “This is a wonderful achievement by Sheila, Keith and Christy.“They must have travelled tens of thousands of miles over the years to visit each Wetherspoon pub.“We thoroughly appreciate their loyalty and commitment and trust they will continue to visit our pubs for many more years to come.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000367711127.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"backlash after cop dresses lgbt bee","story":"The officer donned the bizarre outfit along with yellow sunglasses to promote a pro-LGBT Pride march on 22 September.But Greater Manchester Police was blasted for the stunt in Bolton, which also marked “hate crime awareness” week.Mark Acaster said: “I am an adult gay male.

And four in five residential burglary cases are close without identying a suspect, according to the study of Home Office data of the 12 months to March.The survey also found almost half of all shoplting investigations fail to find a suspect.Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has previously accused the Government of “gambling” with public safety by cutting front-line policing in the city for the eighth year in a row.Last year crime in the region rose by 31 per cent.

The development came as as the PMs beleagured Chequers plan was dealt another hefty blow yesterday as a France launched a fresh attack on it.The new No Deal plans are contained in a leaked diplomatic note, seen by The Sun, issued to EU ambassadors ahead of a meeting in Brussels yesterday.It says: Preparedness has to intensy in the months ahead at national as well as at EU level, as uncertainty remains about the outcome of the negotiations and the ratication of a possible deal. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said on Tuesday that his party is likely to vote down any pact Mrs May secures with Brussels.And Mr Corbyn is set to meet EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier this afternoon after renaming a square in Brussels after murdered MP Jo Cox.An EU official told The Sun: From our side the political risks are relatively limited. The likelihood that  we make a deal that this goes through the Parliament that this is accepted by the Member States, is nearly guaranteed.You cant say that on the UK side. Theres a political risk factor because I dont think Labour will ever, ever help May.We will watch the UK domestic scene in the coming weeks with even bigger interest than we already do.Meanwhile, EU diplomats told The Sun countries are also hardening their stance on no deal to try and scare off Jacob Rees-Moggs ERG. Capitals have formed a common position to rebuff UK pleas for a series of mini-deals in the event of a no deal Brexit.  British negotiators aim to strike pacts with inidual member states and even regions covering areas like aviation and food and medicine. Instead, capitals will stress a no deal scenario would involve an immediate switch to WTO trading terms and Brits requiring visas to visit the continent.An EU diplomat told The Sun: No deal means no deal, and that includes no inidual deals. Well only get the consent of the House of Commons  the price of no deal is really high.MPs must know they have to agree to the deal so as not to have a catastrophic situation. The price must be too high in order not to say no. They stressed the tough stance is a unied EU position, adding: We will not talk to the Brits bilaterally about a deal on a no deal.Another diplomat said capitals were particularly spooked when Mrs May was forced to back down and accept ERG amendments to her Customs Bill in July. They said the development had a knock on effect on the talks and spurred member states into hardening their resolve not to give ground.It is understood EU countries could still take unilateral action in the event of no deal, such as deciding to let planes from the UK still land. But EU sources said such a scenario would be acrimonious and that to agree contingency deals in advance would undermine their own negotiating position.Paris finance minister Bruno Le Maire said the PM had been brave to draw up the blueprint but that it wont wash with EU capitals. His remarks were echoed by Danuta Hubner, who sits on the EU Parliaments Brexit steering group and urged Mrs May to ditch the proposal.Mr Le Maire said: “I’m sorry to say it so callously, there is something more important for us than the future of the UK and that’s the future of the EU. Any decision that would give European citizens the feeling you can exit the EU and keep all the advantages would be suicidal.Ms Hubner added: Its frustrating to us that the UK has left the same unworkable arguments on the table for so long without changing them at all. It has become clear that the remaining issues cannot be resolved by civil servants and officials – political engagement from the UK is needed.The Polish MEP, who chairs the Parliaments constitutional affairs committee, added the blocs treaties prohibit the PMs preferred customs plan .She said: The FCA is an innovation that has no precedent worldwide, has never been tested, and is based on a non-existent technology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in something.We get better at what we practise, whether it’s football or maths.Our brains have a working memory and a long-term memory.If your times tables are stored in your long-term memory, you will quickly be able to calculate what it will cost to buy 12 apples instead of two.If that knowledge isn’t there, you’ll have to resort to counting on your fingers.The more knowledge stored in long-term memory, the better equipped you’ll be to think imaginatively and solve complex problems.Homework revisits what you learn at school to cement it into your long-term memory.I do agree that some home-work is pointless.Silly craft projects that involve gluing things together, which the parent will inevitably end up doing, hold no value for me.I also understand why some parents don’t like homework — they feel that it’s a battle.Parenting is hard.I get that.But we need to stop thinking of homework as a chore that the child is sent off to do, cutting into the parent’s precious time with them.It shouldn’t be the case on Sunday night that Mum says: “Oh God, it’s homework time — let’s get it over with.”Instead, learning should be part of daily le, and an enriching time for both the parent and the child.Reading with your child for 20 minutes should not be a chore.Asking them to count peas on their plate should not be hard work.While you’re out in the street, talk to them about the world around them.This is the sort of homework that is often set for very young children and it can be done without making it feel like a formal lesson.It doesn’t need to be half an hour sitting at a desk.It can just be ten minutes of enjoyable time together.Homework can be written down but can also be spoken or done online, leaving little marking for the teacher.Secondary-school homework can help you learn with your child.You can learn some French again or be reminded of the beauty of Shakespeare!How wonderful is that?By scaffolding the support at home, you can gradually wean them off it, just like taking off bike stabilisers.Eventually, they learn to work independently, so that when they get to GCSEs, they will be in the habit of doing their homework each night.If you don’t get them into the homework habit from an early age, you risk having a battle with a stroppy teen as they approach their exams.And no parent wants that.Those who are against homework will argue that their children have no time for other hobbies.This is nonsense.Children generally finish school at 3.15pm, and younger ones tend to go to bed at about 8pm.That’s nearly five hours of free time.Are they really spending it playing hockey or going to Brownies?I doubt it.Half an hour of homework in five hours of spare time is a drop in the ocean, leaving lots of time for other things.The real worry for parents should be how much time children are spending on social media — something that is so very dangerous and takes up hours of their time, unlike homework.Katharine Birbalsingh is head of Michaela Community School, North London, and has been dubbed the country’s “strictest head teacher”.She introduced an ultra-disciplined approach to

Where investors would fear to tread and from which anyone who could would flee.Labour’s candidate for PM is a dim, vain, vindictive, unapologetically anti­-Semitic ball of rage who loathes scrutiny, lies habitually about his true beliefs and past terrorist connections and is, his aides admit, “not good in the mornings”.But the Tories must not mistake all that for a free pass. Corbyn’s plans have traction only because the Government has left the battlefield.Theresa May and Philip Hammond are timid tinkerers when we need radical steps to put more money in pockets and make homes affordable.

Rex - no jokes about the Labour leader being an old dinosaur, please! - is an apt description of many of the delegates attending this conference: young, left-wing and clamouring for a socialist revolution under Mr Corbyn.And to listen to Mr Corbyn - and his closest ally John McDonnell earlier this week - you\u0027d think Labour\u0027s red revolution was just round the corner and a general election was imminent.Their speeches sounded like those of an opposition leader and shadow chancellor when it\u0027s known that an election is only months away. Mr Corbyn received no fewer than 10 standing ovations during and at the end of his speech.But the biggest was when he said Labour would press for a general election and called on Theresa May and the Tories to make way for Labour.Yet in fringe meetings during the week, most Labour backbenchers who spoke injected a dose of realism and were highly sceptical about the likelihood of an early election, predicting - rightly, surely - that the Tories are not going to risk giving up power by going to the polls.The other really big standing ovation Mr Corbyn won was when he said Labour would \"recognise a Palestinian state as soon as we take office\".Again, as there was during the foreign affairs debate 24 hours earlier, there was waving of Palestinian flags by delegates in the hall. Mr Corbyn had a good passage in his speech on antisemitism, admitting this summer\u0027s row had \"caused immense hurt and anxiety in the Jewish community and great dismay in the Labour Party\".But critics will say his reassuring words to the Jewish community - \"We are your ally\" - should have been said months ago.Having said that, this was probably Mr Corbyn\u0027s best speech as Labour leader - less rambling than some and delivered in a conversational tone with contrasts in pitch and delivery that suggested he\u0027d had some coaching.His Brexit passage was deftly executed too, especially his offer to \"reach out to the prime minister\" and back the Tories  they get a good deal but to vote against an agreement with the EU  they don\u0027t.And one of the smartest lines in Mr Corbyn\u0027s hour-long speech was when he attacked Tory eurosceptics like Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was loudly booed by Labour delegates in true pantomime villain style.\"The Tory Brexiteers unite the politics of the 1950s with the economics of the 19th century, daydreaming about a Britannia that both rules the waves and waives the rules,\" he said. Nice line.Brexit has been a muddle and a struggle for Mr Corbyn and the Labour leadership this week. First a group of party fixers spent six hours, meeting long into the night to agree on the wording of the motion to be debated and voted on by the conference.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/09/2048x1152/skynews-colonel-anatoliy-chepiga_4434384.jpg?20180926190320 ","title":"revealed salisbury suspect is colonel in russian military intelligence","story":"In a tweet that was later deleted, Britain\u0027s defence secretary Gavin Williamson posted: \"The true identity of one of the Salisbury suspects has been revealed to be a Russian colonel.

He used his annual address to his admirers in Liverpool to outline his pitch for a Labour government, telling thousands of party faithful: “Labour is ready.” In an hour-long speech that paused for applause 104 times, he promised a ‘green jobs revolution’, a tax on second homes, and free childcare for all. In a touching tribute in Spanish to his publicity-shy we Laura Alez, he said: You are my force and my support. Thank you Laurita. He addressed the anti-Semitism row which has dogged the party for what he admitted was a “tough” summer.  Boris Johnson, Theresa May - and of course the media - felt the sharp end of Corbyn’s tongue There were even a few pretty good jokes. And, of course, Brexit came up - with the leader vowing as it stands to kill off Theresa May\u0027s plan for leaving the EU. Here’s the most explosive moments of Jeremy Corbyn’s keynote speech to Labour Party Conference.  Corbyn was given a y standing ovation as he addressed the party’s anti-Semitism row - telling the Jewish community, “We are your ally”. The Labour leader admitted this Summer had been “tough” but he pleaded with people to “draw a line” under the saga. His carefully-worded statement said it was “the row over antisemitism” that “caused immense hurt and anxiety in the Jewish community and great dismay in the Labour Party”, rather than anti-Semitism itself. And he accused political opponents who attacked Labour over the row of hypocrisy. He said: “We won’t accept it when we’re attacked by Tory hypocrites who accuse us of antisemitism one day, then endorse Viktor Orban’s hard right government the next. But he also promised to fight anti-Semitism “with every breath I possess.” He added: “I say this to all in the Jewish community: This party, this movement, will always be implacable campaigners against antisemitism and racism in all its forms. We are your ally.” 2. He declared he\u0027d kill off May\u0027s Brexit plan - but gave her a big olive branch  Mr Corbyn made it clear that as it stands, Labour will vote against Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan - which would spell a disastrous defeat for the PM in Parliament. The way ahead is clear,” he declared, despite days of confusion and argument about whether Labour could back a second vote - with the option of Remain. “As it stands, Labour will vote against the Chequers plan or whatever is left of it and oppose leaving the EU with no deal. But he also offered an olive branch to the PM. He said: Deliver a deal that includes acustoms union, no hard border in Ireland, protect jobs, rights at work, environmental and consumer standards, we’ll support that sensible deal.” Delegates applauded as he added: “If you can’t negotiate that, make way for a party that can.” This is an interesting offer. Mr Corbyn did not mention Labour\u0027s \u0027six tests\u0027 for the deal to pass - suggesting, perhaps, he could be rolling the pitch for watering them down. This is confirmed, though. And there\u0027s something pretty important to note - Theresa May has repeatedly refused to enter a customs union.  Delegates whooped and applauded as Corbyn attacked capitalism - after confirming Labour would institute a mass sacking of water firm bosses and force companies to fill a third of their boards with workers. He said: Ten years ago this month, the whole edice of greed-is-good deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth with devastating consequences. But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place. The price of that has not just been stagnation, wages falling for the longest period in recorded history, and almost a decade of deeply damaging cuts to public services.  The conference hall gave its biggest standing ovation of the day after Corbyn promised to recognise the Palestinian state as soon as we take office. Palestinian flags were waved in the hall as delegates cheered. All week, hundreds of delegates have been wearing Palestine lanyards to carry their conference passes. Slamming the “ongoing denial of justice and rights”, Mr Corbyn declared: “Our Party is united in condemning the shooting of hundreds of unarmed demonstrators in Gaza by Israeli forces and the passing of Israel’s discriminatory Nation-State Law. “The continuing occupation, the expansion of illegal settlements and the imprisonment of Palestinian children are an outrage. We support a two-state solution to the conflict with a secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state.” Repeating Labour’s existing policy, Corbyn says: “We will recognise a Palestinian state as soon as we take office.” 5. He acknowledged evidence “clearly” points to Russia being behind the Salisbury attack  Corbyn said the evidence around the Salisbury Novichok poisoning “now points clearly to the Russian state”. It was the Labour leader\u0027s strongest statement yet on the attack, and a big step after he faced months of criticism for questioning the evidence he was provided by the government. He said: “We are entering a new fast-changing and more dangerous world including the reckless attacks in Salisbury - which the evidence painstakingly assembled by the police now points clearly to the Russian state.”  Mr Corbyn blasted the Tories for receiving a hand-signed letter of thanks from Hungarian far-right leader Viktor Orban for their “solidarity”, voting not to sanction him in the European Parliament. Then Mr Corbyn turned his fire on Boris Johnson, who said burqa-wearing women look like letterboxes. He said: “Our Party will never stay silent in the face of growing Islamophobia, whether from the far right on the streets, or the former Foreign Secretary’s disgraceful dog-whistle jibes at Muslim women. Labour will work to bring communities together. It is only through the unity of all our people that we can deliver social justice for anyone.” 7. He told an EXCELLENT joke at Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s expense - complete with pantomime booing  Mr Corbyn said the Tory government are bringing in the lowest corporation tax of any comparable country. Conference booed. “And then there’s Jacob Rees-Mogg!” He said. This time conference REALLY booed. And then he told the best joke of conference season so far, saying Tory Brexiteers are daydreaming about a Britannia that both rules the waves and waives the rules.” He also took aim at Liam Fox, who he said was, “itching to scrap workers’ rights and privatise the NHS ... with a side order of chlorinated chicken.” 8. He announced Labour would dramatically increase the amount of free childcare  Unlimited free childcare will be available for the poorest families under a Labour government, Jeremy Corbyn confirmed. The leader promised a major expansion of the policy to help parents of children aged two to four. Labour already promised last year to offer 30 hours per week of free childcare for all children aged two to four - not just those who work. Despite this being an old policy, Corbyn said “today I can announce” it. The new bit is that Labour will “phase in” a new, additional system that will allow parents to claim extra subsidised hours on top of 30 per week. Labour sources said the extra hours would be available to all parents of kids aged two to four. They would be free for households earning less than \u0026pound16,000, and \u0026pound4 an hour for those earning over \u0026pound66,000, with a sliding scale of fees in between.  Sources said there would be no limit to the number of extra hours a family could claim - effectively making the free hours offer limitless for the poorest households. Labour said Mr Corbyn will also increase funding for nurseries that say they have struggled to afford the Tories\u0027 free childcare scheme. Parents would get a new online portal to manage their account after complaints about the existing system. Over two terms - which could be as late as 2032 - childcare workers would be required to have a \u0027level 3\u0027 qualication  or be working towards one. And pay for all childcare workers would be hiked from a current minimum of \u0026pound7.20 an hour to at least \u0026pound10.Decent early years education is now at risk of becoming a privilege, Jeremy Corbyn said.  Mr Corbyn used his speech to highlight Shadow Housing Minister John Healey\u0027s plan to tax holiday homes. The party estimates up to 174,000 homes would be slapped with the new levy, which is equivalent to double the current rate of council tax on each home - around \u0026pound3,000 a year. It could raise more than \u0026pound500million a year, Labour claimed, and would not apply to rental properties or static caravans. Mr Corbyn said: Think of it as a solidarity fund for those with two homes to help those without any home at all. He went on: Labour will embark on the biggest home building programme in half a century. 10. He invited a Tory peer to cross the floor and join “the new political mainstream  Mr Corbyn said: “Labour speaks for the new majority, why last year we won the biggest increase in the Labour vote since 1945, and why Labour’s ideas have caught “the mood of our time”. “And conference, it isn’t me saying that – it’s a former Conservative Treasury minister, Lord O’Neill. Former Goldman Sachs chief economist Lord O\u0027Neill quit the Northern Powerhouse and Tory whip in 2016, later slamming Conservative splits. “I’ve never sought to capture the mood of a Tory minister before, but let me say to his Lordship: you’re welcome, come and join us in the new political mainstream.” 11. He ranted at the media for \u0027spreading lies\u0027 and \u0027smearing the powerless\u0027  In what has become an annual staple of Corbyn\u0027s conference speech, he had a vicious pop at the mainstream media, accusing them of a “propaganda of privilege”. “It turns out that the billionaires who own the bulk of the British press don’t like us one little bit,” he said. “Now it could be because we’re going to clamp down on tax dodging. Or it may be because we don’t fawn over them at white tie dinners and cocktail parties. “Or it could even be because Tom Watson has been campaigning for the second part of the Leveson media inquiry to be set up.” He said freedom of the press must be protected, but adds: “A free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful.” And in a Trump-esque twist, he encouraged supporters to use social media to challenge the media. He said: You challenge their propaganda of privilege by using the mass media of the 21st century: social media. But he urged followers to be nice. He added: We need to foster a much greater culture of tolerance. An end to abuse, online and in person. We must learn to listen a bit more, and shout a lot less. To focus on what unites us. 12. He unveiled his \u0027green jobs revolution\u0027  Mr Corbyn revealed details of his \u0027green jobs revolution\u0027. The party has committed to reducing Britain\u0027s emissions by 60% by 2030, and eliminating them altogether by 2050. In the process, the party leader claimed Labour would create 400,000 jobs - doubling the number of onshore wind turbines, septupling the number onshore and reversing Tory solar subsidy cuts.

In the text of the speech, he was supposed to say at the very end: Our task is to build that Britain and together we can.

Vowing to reverse the cruel years of Tory austerity, the Labour leader said he will rescue our “left-behind areas” and “forgotten communities”. Mr Corbyn insisted he was ready to enter No 10 and challenged ailing Theresa May to call another snap election – telling her his party is “united and ready to win”. And he sought to outfox the Prime Minister on Brexit by offering a proposal for a deal that keeps us in a customs union – silencing critics who claim he is trying to thwart our split from the EU. Mr Corbyn stepped took the stage in Liverpool as delegates – including we Laura Alez – waved their arms and Jeremy Corbyn scarves in the air to You’ll Never Walk Alone. He received a standing ovation as he declared his movement was now the “political mainstream”, adding: “We represent the new common sense of our time. And we are ready to deliver on it. We must speak for the people to whom Theresa May promised so much but has delivered so little.” Promising to give power back to the people, he pledged Labour would heal the rts in the nation, saying: “Where the Tories have ided and ruled, we will unite and govern.” He was repeatedly interrupted by chants of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” as he spoke of an “alternative to the \u0026shypolitics of austerity, of social ision and of international conflict”.  And he was applauded as he promised to end the public sector pay cap, close the gender pay gap, nationalise the rail, mail, energy and water sectors, boost house-building, save the NHS and invest in a green economy. Stressing Labour’s new sense of unity, he slammed the PM’s botched Brexit negotiations and mocked Mrs May over Tory infighting on the issue. But he warned his own party faithful they must “listen a bit more and shout a lot less” – and strive to create “a greater culture of tolerance” following bitter rows over anti-Semitism and moderate MPs being threatened with deselection.  Mr Corbyn told the hall: “If we are to get the chance to put those values into practice in government, we are going to need unity to do it. “Our movement has achieved nothing when ided against ourselves. Real unity is based on the freedom to disagree and debate, and then come together around democratic decisions, as we have done this week.” Slamming fat-cats and the banks, he warned: “We can no longer tolerate a set-up where the real economy, in which millions work, is a sideshow for the City of London and banks fixated on piling up profits. We need to explore new forms of ownership and public enterprise.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyns economic medicine looks","story":"NewsopinionJeremy Corbyn\u0027s economic medicine looks increasingly attractiveThe Labour leader promised to transform a country still reeling from the financial crash.

This was an address to a country which is still suffering ten years after the financial crash. His plans are bold but his pitch was simple: only Labour has the policies which will mend the damage caused by the banking crisis and the subsequent Tory austerity. Labour, he declared, is now the new majority whose ideas have caught the mood of the time. Much of the speech was directed to those areas which voted Leave in the Brexit referendum.  Corbyn made clear he understood their motives and stood ready to help them rebuild their communities. “There will be no more left behind areas,” he said. Yet this speech was an acknowledgement that his party must do more to persuade voters it was fit to govern. First, there was an appeal to the Labour rank and file to show more unity. Divided and hate-filled parties will not win elections. Secondly, he looked to reassure people that while his agenda was radical it was also common sense. Like a kindly doctor speaking to a patient before an operation, he tried to convince them the procedure may be pioneering but was in their best interests.

Some \u0026pound145million was stolen in the first six months of this year by crooks who persuaded people to transfer cash into dodgy accounts. But just \u0026pound31million of that was refunded to victims, leaving countless people with shattered lives. That’s why it’s vital we all do everything we can to protect our hard-earned cash from thieves. Here’s how you can help stop the scammers...  Con tricks The reason so many people get caught out is that fraudsters keep changing methods, with believable scams that can be dficult to spot. They try to catch people out with cold calls, emails and texts, pretending to be from banks, building societies, credit card firms and the taxman, and they send out official-looking correspondence complete with logos. They set up bogus websites selling everything from holidays to cars and fake investments. People are lured in via social media with too-good-to-miss deals on products such as mobiles and computers. They also cash in on data breaches at high-profile firms by impersonating officials just after a hack has taken place to try and catch customers off guard. However convincing someone sounds, it’s best to be cautious and always double check before transferring money anywhere. Telephone calls Hang up on cold calls immediately. Don’t rely on caller ID as thieves can spoof phone numbers to look like they are calling from a trusted person. If you think your bank is trying to contact you, or you want to check something, use the number on your bank card or on the bank’s official website. Use a dferent phone to the one the cold call came in on. Crooks often stay on the line after people hang up and then pretend to be the bank or organisation you are trying to call. A call isn’t fully disconnected until the caller puts the phone down.  Emails Be wary and never click on links in emails. Double-check the sender’s address matches the genuine website address by rolling your mouse pointer over the sender’s name to reveal its true identity. Other warning signs are errors in spelling and grammar, and  they don’t contain your proper name, ie they are addressed to Dear customer. And always be cautious of vague details like a PO Box address or mobile-only phone number. Texts Don’t believe a text is always from a genuine organisation. Rogues have found a way to send texts that appear in the same chain of messages as those from your bank or building society. These often contain links that take you to a fake website to get you to disclose personal and financial information. Or they give out bogus phone numbers. Always type in official website addresses from scratch and only call firms on numbers you know are genuine.  Remote Do not allow someone remote access to your computer after a cold call. Don’t log on to banking  someone is remotely connected to your computer. And never do online banking or carry out financial transactions over free wi connections – such as on trains or in cafes. Transfers One key way fraudsters lure people into transferring cash is by posing as someone from a bank or an official body such as the police. They explain cash needs to be moved for safety reasons. Banks or the police will never get you to transfer money to a new account because of suspected fraud. Need for speed Don’t be rushed into anything. A genuine organisation will not mind  you check the person is who they say they are. Limited-time offers that pressure you into taking action should set alarm bells ringing. Stop, think and double-check. While it might take a little longer to make transactions and to log into accounts, always opt for two-step verication when you can. That means you get a text message when you try to log in from somewhere new. And that will prevent fraudsters getting into your accounts without having access to your mobile phone too. Details Never give out personal information, account details or security information such as passwords or PINs. Your bank or organisation such as the police or HMRC will never ask for these.

Sheila and Keith Latchford told their autistic son Christy they would take him to every one of the pubs in the country.  Christy, then 17, kept them to their promise - sparking a ten year tour of the UK and Ireland’s drinking holes. They ticked off 900 Wetherspoons in the first six years but were so prolic they had to wait for new ones to open.  The family, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, were first through the door at the chain\u0027s latest opening in Somerset last week. The only existing bars they have not been to yet are the two beyond security at Heathrow\u0027s Terminal 5. Recalling the promise, Sheila, 61, said: “Our daughter Amy works at the Penny and Black Wetherspoon in Kidderminster. “When she started Christy was not yet 18.  “We wanted to take him in to show her working behind the bar but in those days they had a really strict rule which meant anyone under 18 had to have a meal. We had just eaten so left. “I said rather foolishly, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, ‘don’t worry, when you are 18 we will go to all of them.’ “When you say something like that to someone with autism it is taken seriously. “The minute he turned 18 he was back in the Penny and Black. “We were never intending to do them all, but had promised him and he wouldn\u0027t let us forget it.”  She said The Caley Picture House in Edinburgh is their favourite, followed by The Cabot Court hotel in Weston-super-Mare. Keith, a full time carer for Christy, now 28, said: “Everyone tends to say that the historical buildings are the best, and that is true. “There are some beautul conversions of old premises and some of the newer pubs in particular are fantastic. “It is a great hobby for us together and Christy loves it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"former pm john major refused","story":"NewsFormer PM John Major \u0027refused to agree to compensate blood scandal victims\u0027An ongoing inquiry is also investigating whether there was a cover-up after infected blood was mistakenly given to almost 5,000 patientsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMartin BagotHealth and Science Correspondent22:03, 26 SEP 2018NewsFormer Tory PM John Major \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email John Major refused to agree to compensate victims of the contaminated blood scandal, an inquiry has heard.

Rushmoor in Hampshire is the place where people gave the highest score to the question, how happy were you yesterday, according to an official Government survey. Respondents rated their average happiness as 8.4 out of 10 in 2017/18, up from 7.8 in 2016/17, meaning the area overtakes Craven in North Yorkshire, which was the happiest place in 2016/17, as the happiest place in the UK. Across the UK, average ratings across the four measures of personal well-being were: 7.7 out of 10 for le satisfaction, 7.9 out of 10 for feeling that what you do in le is worthwhile, 7.5 out of 10 for happiness yesterday and 2.9 out of 10 for anxiety yesterday. The Office for National Statistics survey data, compiled between April 2017 and March 2018 and broken down by local authority, shows average ratings for wellbeing across the UK have not changed overall. So how does your area compare?   The local authority area with the lowest ratings for happiness was Fenland in Cambridgeshire, with 6.7 out of 10. People in Rushmoor also have the highest le satisfaction, rating it as 8.6 out of 10, while people in Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire have the lowest, 7.1 out of 10. For feeling le is worthwhile, again people in Rushmoor gave the highest rating at 8.7 out of 10, while the lowest was in Bromley at 7.4. People in Broxbourne in Hertfordshire felt the most anxious, scoring levels the previous day at 3.9 out of 10, while those in Lisburn and Castlereagh in Northern Ireland were the least anxious, just 1.9 out of 10. Average ratings of feeling the things done in le are worthwhile increased in Scotland this was driven by a higher percentage of people reporting very high levels for this measure. Compared with the UK, a larger percentage of people in Wales reported low levels of worthwhile and happiness. Interestingly, a larger proportion of people in Wales reported both low levels of le satisfaction but also very high levels of le satisfaction, suggesting greater disparity in le satisfaction in Wales compared with the UK overall.

It\u0027s not too late for workers to begin thinking about their annual leave requests - and  they\u0027re wise they can use this trick to maximise their time off. By picking the right days as holiday, Brits can get 11 days off using just four days\u0027 annual leave, giving them more time with family or doing whatever it is they want to be doing. But workers may have to act fast and sneak in their request before others catch on. Here\u0027s how to pull it off.  Christmas Eve is a working day for many Brits, and this year it falls on a Monday.

The closest we can picture any of them coming to committing a crime is Prince Harry recently swiping some extra samosas from the launch of the Grenfell charity cookbook.  But what would happen  any of them were actually to do something illegal - would they be arrested or would they get away with it simply because of who they are? Here\u0027s everything you need to know...   After marrying in to the most famous family in the country, Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton inherited many fabulous perks - from dazzling tiaras to household chefs and drivers.   However there is one royal perk that by far outweighs the rest and that is Sovereign Immunity - but only The Queen has it.  This is a law which states that the sovereign cannot commit a legal wrong and is thus immune from civil suit or criminal prosecution.  Therefore The Queen is completely above the law, she can quite literally do no wrong. But according to the royal family\u0027s website, she still likes to make sure she remains on the straight and narrow: Although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the Sovereign as a person under UK law, The Queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law. Unfortunately for other members of the royal household, this blanket immunity does not apply to anyone else.  So for the likes of Prince Charles , Prince William , Prince Harry , Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle, there is a price to be paid for committing a crime.   Of course, being royalty, when it comes to their punishment there are a few loopholes. According to the legal encyclopedia Halsbury\u0027s Laws of England, members of the royal household cannot be arrested in civil proceedings, arrests can\u0027t take place in the monarch\u0027s presence and they also cannot be arrested anywhere near a palace. One royal has already been given a criminal conviction.

The Duchess of Sussex got to try out the traditional Maori greeting, the \u0027hongi\u0027 at a royal engagement last night, but eagle-eyed observers noticed she looked a little odd when she did it. The \u0027hongi\u0027, when two people press their noses against one another, is a bit like a handshake or a kiss on the cheek in Maori communities in New Zealand. Meghan kept her eyes OPEN for the hongi when they are often closed or lowered for the greeting.  Kate Middleton is no stranger to the hongi, after she visited New Zealand on her and William\u0027s official tour in 2014 and said hello to people using the traditional Maori greeting several times. The Duchess shared a particularly cute moment with a five-year-old girl, where she was seen crouching down and rubbing noses with the child.

Kelly Edgson-Payne was mortied and in tears when a male member of cabin crew told her she could not feed her one-year-old son Lex during take-off. The 36-year-old was flying from London Gatwick to Fuerteventura, Spain, on August 20, with her husband Ross, 40, and four children, when the unpleasant incident happened. Kelly, from Rochester, Kent, said: It\u0027s just absolutely crazy that I was told that I couldn\u0027t feed him - crazy, and really embarrassing for me.  Kelly - who says she has never had an issue breastfeeding any of her children on flights - has now hit out at easyJet for not seeming to know the law about breastfeeding. I find it really disappointing that an airline I trust, and who we fly with all the time, actually broke the law in discriminating against me as a breastfeeding mother, she said. The law in the UK says it protects breastfeeding mothers - and even easyJet\u0027s own website says mothers are welcome to breastfeed at any time during a flight. There\u0027s just no consistency in their messages. They should not be discriminating against breastfeeding.  When the sports therapist raised the issue with easyJet Customer Services, she was told she was welcome to breastfeed her baby on their flights - as long as you are discreet. She added: We fly with easyJet literally all the time, and I have always breastfed all my children over the years during take-off - because their ears pop and its uncomfortable for them. Most other cabin crew would actually encourage breastfeeding during take-off, because it distracts them and stops them from crying. I\u0027ve never before been told that I can\u0027t feed Lex, or any of my other children - and we\u0027ve flown with him about 16 times in the last year. So I got settled into my seat and I started to feed my son, as I would usually. Then a male member of cabin crew came over and told me I couldn\u0027t feed him during take-off, and that I\u0027d have to stop and strap him in to his infant seat next to me. Kelly continued: It was just crazy. I said, \u0027Well, he\u0027s feeding\u0027. But I just had to stop mid-feed and hand him to my husband.  I was mortied. I\u0027m not afraid to breastfeed my baby wherever - I\u0027ve stopped at a break point during a marathon before and fed him - but this left me embarrassed and in tears. I had to very quickly cover myself up - but my breasts were still leaking milk, because I had stopped mid-feed. Even my eldest daughter, who is nine, said, \u0027Mummy, they can\u0027t tell you not to breastfeed him\u0027. Kelly, mum to Mia, nine, Elena, five, Jax, three, and Lex, one, said a female member of cabin crew later approached her after take-off and apologised for the incident. She said: The two of them had a bit of a hoo-ha, and she then later came up to me and said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry about that, ignore him, he\u0027s wrong.\u0027 What annoys and disappoints me is that there is no consistency. On their website they state, \u0027We support breastfeeding mothers and you can feed your baby on board at any time\u0027. But when I emailed their customer services about it afterwards, I was told, \u0027Passengers are allowed to breastfeed their babies on board the aircraft, as long as you are doing this in a discreet manner\u0027.  The ironic thing is, since having my third and fourth children, whenever I fly I have always booked my infant a seat next to me. So I\u0027ve never in the last six years sat next to a random passenger. Up until the cabin crew told me I couldn\u0027t breastfeed, I don\u0027t think any other passengers were even paying any attention to me at all. Kelly added that all easyJet offered her in the way of compensation was a \u0026pound25 voucher to be used on another flight with them. She said: I just want them to make themselves aware of the law so no other mums have to go through this.

Jay Lennon Gascoigne, 22, was found dead at his girlfriend\u0027s home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear.  A court heard he had battled mental health issues from the age of 13 and became dependant on drugs and alcohol, occasionally bought off the internet.  But today - the third day of his inquest in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear - the coroner ruled Mr Gascoigne took a fatal cocktail of drugs despite repeated warnings from health professionals in his last months.  However, Terence Carney, coroner for Gateshead and South Tyneside, ruled the death was accidental.  The court heard how Mr Gascoigne, previously known as Kerrigan, suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder  from childhood which caused him anxiety and distress, with intrusive thoughts, when he was growing up.   His distraught mum Anna Kerrigan said in a statement he seemed to fall between the crack of mental health and drug services.  Mental health services needed him to be free from drugs to be able to clearly diagnose his condition as an adult, the court heard.  And drug services required his ongoing mental health issues to be addressed in order to help him. The coroner rejected that there were systemic failures which contributed signicantly to his death in April 2016. Mr Carney said Mr Gascoigne presented with a complex medical profile, which included OCD and poly-drug use. The coroner said: I am not satisfied that he deliberately intended to self-harm, I question whether he fully understood or appreciated, despite the number of times he would be told, the real dangers that he faced. To lose a child at such a tender age, against a background of such intensive management care by the family, and particularly mum, must be heart-rending in the extreme.

A World Health Organisation study found 50.3% of boys in England drank weekly in 2002 compared with just 10% in 2014. Wales had the second largest drop, from 47.6% to 11.8%. And more than 43.1% of girls in England boozed weekly in 2002, falling to 8.9% in 2014. This was the largest drop for girls across the 36 nations, followed by a plunge from 41.1% to 10.7% in Scotland. The report, which looked at drinking among 15-year-olds, was led by the University of St Andrews. Lead editor Dr Jo Inchley said: “Overall reductions have been greatest in countries that traditionally had higher prevalence, such as Britain and the Nordic region. “This makes it clear change is possible, however more should be done to ensure adolescents are effectively protected from the harms caused by alcohol.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast temperatures top","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Temperatures to top 24C in the South making country hotter than GreeceBut heavy rain is expected in the North as the Met Office predicts another North/South splitShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ShentonUS Showbiz Editor 03:19, 27 SEP 2018Updated03:29, 27 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/uk-news/video/whats-going-like-you-live-13316786,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTemperatures are expected to top 24C today as the Indian summer continues to warm the UK - but heavy rain is expected in the North.

Across northern areas it\u0027s really quite a warm start but it\u0027s also rather wet in a few places, Alex Deakin of the Met Office said. Whereas in the South it\u0027s going to be another beautul day. A chilly start, although not as cold as recent mornings.  He continued: There\u0027s a bit more fog around so bear that in mind for the morning commute. Across parts of Southern England, Wales and the Midlands temperatures will go down into single figures and it won\u0027t be far off freezing in some rural spots. Mr Deakin adds there will be more cloud over North-West England and North-West Scotland.  We are starting the day a lot of rain across the far North-West and that rain will push southwards, but as it does so the rain will tend to fizzle out. He says: Further South we start cold, but then the mist and fog should clear through the morning and then we\u0027ve got a lot of warm sunshine. Temperatures will be higher than the last couple of days - 23C-24C is possible across East Anglia and the South-East, whereas further North it will be feeling that much cooler.

The image, taken in Milk in Edinburgh, shows a young woman in a red dress looking distinctly unimpressed and staring into space while a man leans, shouting, into the side of her face. It looks like a classic nightclub scene of a girl being chatted up by a stranger who has, well, no chat.

In the Bible, Moses is said to have liberated the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and led them through the wilderness of Sinai, before they crossed the River Jordan into the promised land of Canaan. However, no historical basis for the account exists and archaeologists generally agree that the Israelites were, in fact, native to Canaan - an ancient region covering modern day Israel. But now, experts are analysing whether ruins near the river are proof of a nomadic Israelite people crossing into the ancient land from outside. Some claim it could be the first ever evidence of the Biblical account.  We have not proved that these camps are from the period of of the early Israelites, but it is possible, said David Ben-Shlomo, an archaeologist with Ariel University. If they are, this might fit the biblical story of the Israelites coming from east of the Jordan River, then crossing the Jordan and entering into the hill country of Israel later. Archaeologists are analysing whether the ruins, named Khirbet el Mastarah, are consistent with a newly-arrived nomadic people. Pottery shards from the site have been dated to the early Iron Age, around the time traditionally associated with the Israelite arrival. Meanwhile, the ruins themselves, a number of low walls, are believed to be rudimentary stone fencing for animals - consistent with known nomadic practices.  According to Dr Ben-Shlomo and his American dig partner, Ralph Hawkins of Averett University, this could explain why pottery shards at the site were found outside - not inside - the stone walls. The floors of the structures were virtually empty of finds, and thus, we could not date them by conventional archaeological methods, they said. In Bedouin settlements, people live in tents made of perishables which are relocated every season, thus artacts would not be associated with stone architecture. So the structures might have housed animals, rather than people, who lived in tents around them. The site, five miles north of Jericho, is also said to make more sense as a nomadic settlement than a permanent one. Temperatures there can easily reach a searing 45C, while annual rainfall is as little as 1cm.  The landscape is arid most of the time and even in modern times most of the population here are Bedouins, said Dr Ben-Shlomo. Furthermore, the site is isolated and is shielded from view by the surrounding hills - perhaps implying a new population in fear of a hostile reception. Now, the archaeologists are working to confirm whether site is as old as they suspect. Dr Ben-Shlomo said: Sites like Khirbet el Mastarah and other similar ones in the Jordan Valley seem - at least from survey material - to appear suddenly during the Iron Age. Since this area is not densely populated in many periods, this might indicate a new phenomenon like nomads suddenly creating settlements, or a new population.  Soil samples from Khirbet el Mastarah have now been sent for analysis. Samples from beneath the walls will be tested for a build-up of electrons, which get trapped over the years and are only released by light radiation. They could reveal the age of the structure, it is claimed. Meanwhile, samples from between the walls will be tested for elevated levels of phosphorus, which would be consistent with animal dung accruing in them. Results are expected in a few months. The archaeologists are also planning to excavate nearby Uja el-Foqa to determine whether it might be linked to Israelite settlement of the region. However the work is not without its challenges - archaeologists must look for cultural clues that the site was indeed Israelite. It is dficult since many aspects of the material culture of dferent groups  may be too similar or not indicative enough, said Dr Ben-Shlomo.

Post-administration Livingston took a massive 15 games to get a victory in 2005 with just one point from their first seven.You get the idea.For the Dark Blues, though, there is a small chink of sunshine, a ray of hope for the most optimistic fans to cling on to despite having no points from the first six games.The ‘12th team’ season was a poor one, of course, with plenty of reasons behind a dreadful start.A side built to get promotion from the First Division was suddenly parachuted into the top flight as Rangers were booted out.And Barry Smith’s side struggled badly. However, by this point, even they had four points from their first six games.Overall, though, nine losses in 11 games was a recipe for disaster and ended with relegation in bottom spot with 30 points.Head back to 1993 and Simon Stainrod’s final few games in charge tell a similar story to Dundee’s current predicament.No wins to their name, two draws however, led to Stainrod being moved from a manager role to director of football with his No 2 Jim Duffy taking over.They eventually beat Hearts on October 2, 1993, with goals from Garry Paterson and Dragutin Ristic.In the first of his three spells as gaffer at Dens, Duffy as player-manager couldn’t keep the Dark Blues from finishing in bottom spot – a side that eventually included a very young Neil McCann.However, head back to the early 80s and a spell where Dundee were perennially bad starters to seasons.Starting in 1980/81, Donald Mackay’s Dark Blues certainly weren’t early risers.In the First Division, that season saw no wins in the opening seven matches with two 0-0 draws at least putting something on the board.Remarkably, they didn’t manage to score a single goal in the league until the fth game.Brian Scrimgeour broke that duck in a 2-1 defeat at Hibs before they finally managed a victory at the eighth time of asking.That saw Eric Sinclair grab two along with goals from John Fletcher and Peter Mackie in a 4-0 success over Falkirk.Fast forward to the end of the campaign and that sluggish start didn’t hurt too much as Mackay’s men won promotion to the top flight, finishing second to Hibs, scoring 64 goals on the way.Two campaigns later and it was a similar story to today.The Dark Blues were yet to pick up a victory in the Premier Division by October 1 in 1983/84.At that time, there had only been five league games by that point with a League Cup group stage taking up the early fixtures.Only a 0-0 draw with St Mirren gave them anything before two own goals from Motherwell got them up and running.Eventually, Mackay’s reign came to an end in December of that year.In his place came Archie Knox to keep them in the ision, finishing four points ahead of St Johnstone.Signings like John Brown and Robert Connor saw Knox transform the Dark Blues into a solid mid-table outfit before Jocky Scott took over for the first time in 1986 and continued that.Dundee have history of getting themselves out of bad starts – whether they stick like they did with Mackay or twist with someone like Knox, they have previous.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inniss calls on dundee team mates to show character after seventh straight defeat","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRyan Inniss has told his Dundee team-mates to look within themselves and find the fight that will rescue boss Neil McCann from the sack.The Dens Park boss is clinging on to his job after a seventh straight defeat against Hibernian on Saturday.The 3-0 loss to Neil Lennon\u0026#8217s men means the Dark Blues have yet to take a point from their six Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures so far this season.Now next week\u0026#8217s trip to Hamilton is looking like a make-or-break showdown for McCann\u0026#8217s reign \u0026#8211 so long as Dee chiefs do not decide to act before then.With so much hanging on that clash, Crystal Palace loanee Inniss knows his side cannot lie down as meekly as they did against Hibs.But the centre-back says it is down to his new colleagues to find the desire that will halt their slide \u0026#8211 not their manager.He said: \u0026#8220We will go again but we have got to take it personally, I mean really, really personally.\u0026#8220We\u0026#8217re talking about character here \u0026#8211 not ability.\u0026#8220For me, you find your level with ability eventually.

The developer, Dutch property firm Vastint Hospitality, could not be contacted.A y Inverness debate ended on Tuesday with an 8-7 vote to refuse the application despite Ness-side SNP councillor Ron MacWilliam\u0027 insistence that the vision was that of \"a grand building, that you\u0026rsquod expect to see in a serious city centre\".Inverness Central ward party colleague Richard Laird, however, successfully argued that it \"failed to make a positive contribution to the city\u0027 architecture,\" and therefore contravened the local plan.He described the design as \"absolutely bogging\" and \"exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to tear down in the middle of Inverness\".He and several committee colleagues were also concerned about the potential impact of future traffic movement in Waterloo Place and Glebe Street as a result of the proposed development.There was general support for a hotel to be built at the location but Cllr Laird said the drawing board proposition \"looks exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to teardown in the middle of Inverness\" \u0026ndash a reference to the council\u0027 recent approval for bulldozing and replacing the \u0026lsquo60s-built Bridge Street \"blots on the landscape\".Committee colleague Bill Lobban considered the hotel design \"hideous\".He said: \"It\u0027 the most visible site in the whole of Inverness.

This time it must be hoped they use this as a catalyst to push on.Triumphing in penalty shoot-outs is all about having the belief and confidence to bury the ball and the skill to do it.Aberdeen have been Scotland’s second best team for the vast majority of the five and a half years McInnes has been at the helm.They have secured four runners-up finishes in the Premiership but there is only the solitary League Cup trophy triumph in 2014 from that period.For all the plaudits for the consistency of finishing second trophies are what fans want, and what are remembered.Aberdeen are now just two wins away from silverware and will unlikely face a tougher challenge than Hibs away.It was the Reds who created the opening chance in the third minute when Andy Considine’s shot from 10 yards out hit Mark Milligan before being scrambled away.Soon after the dangerous Florian Kamberi rounded keeper Joe Lewis only to shoot into the side netting.Then Emerson Hyndman skewed a 15-yard shot wide before Gary Mackay-Steven followed suit by firing off target.Following impressive play, on-loan Manchester United striker James Wilson was fouled by Mark Milligan. From the free-kick Dom Ball curled a superb 25-yard effort that rattled the crossbar and bounced inches from the line.It should have been the catalyst for an Aberdeen onslaught but instead it was the home side who controlled the rest of the half.In the 36th minute Martin Boyle, who had a goal chalked off minutes earlier for hand ball, burst past Max Lowe into the box only to blast wide with the goal beckoning.Hibs were turning the screw and Lewis saved from Shaw at the near post in the 42nd minute with Kamberi then shooting over soon after the break.The increasingly busy Lewis produced a superb, and brave, close-range block at the near post to deny Hanlon.As the high tempo continued Wilson fired in a low left-footed 30-yard drive but Bogdan comfortably saved.Hibs should have gone ahead in the 85th minute when Shaw was played clean in by Hyndman but he blasted wide.In extra time it was the Dons who wasted glaring opportunities when substitute Stevie May was played through the offside trap by Chris Forrester. May hesitated with his shot before firing it across goal and wide.Moments later McGinn missed an even clearer opportunity when through only to blast over.Hibs were denied in the 104th minute when a flicked header from Ryan Porteous was cleared off the line by Considine.The penalty drama was played out in front of the vocal Aberdeen fans in the South Stand.Captain Graeme Shinnie comfortably netted before Lewis superbly saved from Stevie Mallan.It was all square when McGinn’s spot-kick was saved. But the Reds secured a spot at Hampden when Thomas Agyepong’s penalty hit the bar.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man accused of disfiguring doctor at north east medical centre","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man has appeared in court today accused of assaulting a doctor – leaving him disfigured – at a north-east medical centre.David Gibson appeared at Forfar Sherf Court facing a string of charges over an alleged incident at the Links Health Centre on Tuesday afternoon.He faced four charges on petition during a brief private hearing.It is alleged that he possessed a kne and assaulted the man, understood to be a doctor at the centre, to his injury and disfigurement.Gibson, 42, of Montrose, also faces two further charges of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner likely to cause fear or alarm.Gibson made no plea during hearing and the case was continued for further examination.He was remanded in custody pending a further hearing next week.Inspector Steve Rose, of Police Scotland’s Tayside Division, said: “Police were called to Frank Wood Way, Montrose, at 4.55pm in relation to a disturbance.“The incident was contained in a specic building. There was no risk to the wider public and the male concerned has been taken in to custody.“I would like to take the opportunity to thank the public who were at the incident for their co-operation and patience while it was dealt with.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"north east woman caught drink driving for third time was almost five times over limit1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA third-time drink-driver has admitted getting behind the wheel in the north-east while almost five times the limit.Dawn Elrick was caught driving in Ellon while over the limit twice in the space of a fortnight.The 31-year-old previously pled guilty to driving with 78 microgrammes  of alcohol in 100ml of breath on Station Road in Ellon on June 25. The legal limit is 22mcg.And yesterday Elrick was back in the dock over a separate incident less than two weeks earlier on June 13.This time she admitted driving with 106mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath on the town’s Craigs Road.Defence agent Les Green, representing Elrick, said his client was taking steps to address her alcohol consumption.He said: “She tells me she’s not drinking any more and is attending AA meetings.”Sherf Sukhwinder Gill told Elrick, whose address was given as Mackie Avenue, Tarves: “It’s your third conviction for drink-driving. I’m going to call for reports.”She deferred sentence on Elrick until next month for a social work report and restriction of liberty assessment.She had her bail continued, but was disqualied from driving in the interim period until sentencing, despite already having been banned.There was no Crown narrative of events given at this stage in proceedings.However, during the last case in July, the court heard concerned motorists had alerted police after witnessing Elrick swerving across the road and clipping a kerb on Station Road on June 25.Sherf Philip Mann banned Elrick from driving for three years, ordered her to be supervised for one year and to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work.On that occasion fiscal depute Cheryl Clark said: “The accused was seen at about 5.10pm on June 25 by a couple who saw she was travelling in front of them.“They were concerned about the manner of her driving.”Ms Clark said Elrick was seen to sway around the road at about 40mph and “clip the kerb”.She added her driving had “caused other motorists to take evasive action”.Witnesses contacted the police who traced the vehicle to an address and found Elrick inside.Ms Clark said: “Police spoke with the accused. She appeared upset and smelled strongly of alcohol.”Defence agent for that case John McLeod said: “This lady has had a real problem with alcohol.“She has sought help in the past and is currently again seeking help.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/KMil_Penguin_Auct-17.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"maggies penguin parade auction 540000 raised for charity at va dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOver half a million pounds has been raised for charity at the Maggie’s Penguin Parade auction in Dundee.A packed audience at the V\u0026ampA gasped in delight as the £539,000 total was announced following frantic bidding for the 82 lots on offer. 100vw, 620px\" /A donation of £1000 from the floor rounded the total figure to £540,000.\u0026nbspAfter a summer of bringing joy to families across Tayside and Fe, the Maggie’s Penguins went under the hammer at V\u0026ampA in front of an audience of around 300 people.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"moonpig is politely asking people to stop uploading pictures of genitals","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOnline greetings company Moonpig has had to tell prospective customers to stop uploading pictures of their genitals to make a bespoke card.The firm posted on Twitter that the action is against Moonpig’s “terms and conditions”.In a 17-word tweet it posted: “Please stop uploading pics of your genitals to our cards it is against our ts and cs”.\u0026mdash Moonpig  September 26, 2018It later confirmed it gets between two and three per day, and up to 20 a day around Valentine’s Day.The announcement was liked and shared thousands of times and whipped up a lot of conversation.But not everyone thought the tweet would solve the company’s issues.One person wrote: “This is probably not the best way to stop people doing this.

The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item  they are not at home when we deliver.

Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor 31","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 15/08/18, 5:40 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,I wanted to thank the folk on last Thursday\u0026#8217s 14.45 number 23 bus from Oban.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Having moved to Glasgow, Alison can no longer chair the group as a non-Argyll resident. She added that there is a degree of \u0026#8216committee fatigue\u0026#8217 among the group, while the computer equipment used by Autism Argyll is getting past its sell-by date.But the most signicant factor in ending Autism Argyll, said Alison, is a lack of support from senior management at Argyll and Bute Council over many years.She said: \u0026#8216Argyll and Bute has an agreed and published Autism Strategy, which the authority commissioned Scottish Autism to produce. There is also an implementation plan. However, neither is promoted and both are largely ignored.\u0026#8216The only time senior management appear to take any interest in those iniduals and families living with autism is  it they think it is going to cost the authority money.\u0026#8216At senior manager level, Argyll and Bute Council has rejected our knowledge, rebuffed our experiences, frustrated our efforts, sapped our enthusiasm, drained our goodwill and defeated us.\u0026#8217There is good news, however. Operating in Argyll and Bute with the support of Scottish Autism, the Get Set 4 Autism project provides online resources for professionals dealing with autism.Parents of recently diagnosed children also have access to an autism advisor and the Right Click online programme, helping to provide clear, timely and sensible information and support.Alison continued: \u0026#8216Autism Argyll has raised awareness, improved knowledge and understanding, and forged partnerships with iniduals and organisations such as Scottish Autism. We should be proud of our achievements.\u0026#8217Responding to the criticism, an Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216We are saddened that Autism Argyll has been dissolved and we thank the organisation for its work down the years to educate the wider community on autism and to support people living with the condition.\u0026#8216We are working with our partners, including Cornerstone and Scottish Autism, on the development of residential resources in Garelochhead and Helensburgh, and also to improve services for people with autism across Argyll and Bute by way of introducing and implementing the Autism Toolbox.\u0026#8216Additionally, we have engaged with Autism Network Scotland for their assistance in further implementing our autism strategy, and these meetings will continue.\u0026#8217Responsibility for autism support also falls under the remit of Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership, and a spokesman confirmed that it had advertised for a new autism practitioner.He added: \u0026#8216We have been working closely with our partners to support those iniduals living in Argyll and Bute with autism and we have been exploring how we can build on the current services that are available. \u0026#8216PICS:Back to the beginning \u0026#8211 Autism Argyll is formed in 2000. no_a38AutismArgyll01Committee members past and present gather for the last-ever Autism Argyll AGM. 06_a38AutismArgyll03It was an emotional occasion for founder members Maureen MacIntosh, left, and chairwoman Alison Leask. 06_a38AutismArgyll02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"furnace shop and post office facing closure","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 21/09/18, 2:49 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFurnace Village Store and Post Office is set to close at the end of the year unless someone can be found to carry on the business.The shop, with its three-bedroom bungalow behind, has been owned and managed by Mike and Syb Masters for the past 18 years.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past 24 years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities. Alzheimer Scotland wants to make sure that people with dementia and their carers can work with local decision makers, helping to influence important decisions about how vital care and support is delivered in their area.We need your help to ensure people with dementia and carers get the best possible standard of care and support, anywhere in Scotland.

An early-morning police raid revealed Thomas Caldwell’s disgusting collection. The 35-year-old was caught with 18 Category A movies- showing the most vile type of child abuse. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that Caldwell, of Kyle StreetAyr, immediately admitted that he ‘downloaded some stuff’. And he blurted out to officers “I don’t get a lot of girls”. Caldwell admitted being in possession of the indecent material between March 15 and November 6. And he faced his sentencing last Thursday for his heinous behaviour. Defence solicitor Tony Currie told Sherf John Montgomery: “He did everything to be compliant with the police process. “He’s a man who’s used pornography in the past and he’s unfortunately allowed it to stray on these occasions. “He lost his employment as a direct consequence because of this matter and he’s actually sourced alternative employment.”  The Sherf queried reference made in the reports to one 27-minute long video. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin replied: “That’s the one they’ve chosen to describe in detail.” Steering clear of putting Caldwell behind bars, the Sherf said: “Quite clearly any offence of this gravity well merits a custodial sentence. “But my  is to consider  custody is the only option. “And in your case, involving mitigating and aggravating factors in respect of your offence -I’ve come to the conclusion that the mitigating outweighs the aggravating, and therefore conclude that you could be dealt with by way of a community payback order. “You will be supervised in the community for three years and it will be a requirement that you will be part of the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. “You do not approach or speak to a child under the age of 16 unless approved from your supporting officer.” Caldwell was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, and must not access the internet via computer or mobile phone. He has been placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register.

Lisa revealed: “We must have visited more than 30 but were blown away by the approach of the Savoy Park. “Lots of places didn’t like the idea of a dog running around during the wedding, but the Savoy couldn’t have been more accomodating. “The three of us are going on a doggy-moon and will spend time glamping. But me and Robert are also heading to Australia so hopefully he’ll be okay without us.” Savoy general manager Barbara Christie said: “We were delighted to have Bobby as part of the day and he was a real star. “He came to get ready beforehand – complete with his doggy aftershave. “A couple of years ago this might have seemed odd but it’s something that more people are now wanting. “Dogs are a big part of the family so I’m sure it’s not the last time we’ll host a ceremony like this.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrTartanPetsAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"new ayrshire nursery gets thumbs","story":"NewsNew Ayrshire nursery gets the thumbs upHuge public support helped win permission for the building within the Heads of Ayr Farm Park.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:00, 24 SEP 2018NewsHeads of Ayr farm park nursery design \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new nursery is to be built surrounded by farmyard animals and cute critters. Huge public support helped win permission for the building within the Heads of Ayr Farm Park. And up to 20 jobs will be created. In a recent Ayrshire Post article celebrating 25 years of the farm park bosses Craig and Edna Rankin were excited about gaining approval for the nursery. They had suffered a blow as planning officials knocked it back in March on seven dferent policy points. But the couple’s architect Chris Stewart of Casa design in Ayr revealed: “Planning permission has now been granted for a new nursery school for up to 60 children. “It was approved on appeal on by the councillors on the Local Review Body.” Naturally the new nursery will have an outdoor theme. Edna said: “There is demand to get children back to nature and get outdoors. “There are so many new houses at Fisherton and Doonfoot and the area needs something. “Our own staff here cannot even find places to send their children.” Highly unusually, the plan had won universal support from the public with not one objection lodged with South Ayrshire Council. The application had been sent in earlier in 2017 but it was thrown out in December by council planners who were branded “very negative” by the architect. The site is currently a donkey pasture to the left of the farm steading and attractions and will include a new dedicated entrance from the A719 and car parking. The nursery will be built in the agricultural style with plenty of wooden cladding and some roof lights to mock a barn. The park attracts 180,000 people a year and has 90 staff. Director Greg Rankin said: “We were delighted to have planning for the Nursery granted by the Councils Local Review Board and I would like to thank them. “They were able to see the clear benefits that this project will bring to the area both for the local economy and local families . As well as all of the advantages to having a Nursery on site at Heads of Ayr Farm Park providing kids with the chance to learn and play in a safe outdoor environment. “Work on the Nursery starts shortly and we hope to have construction completed by Autumn next year. We are very excited to get started on its development and have been encouraged by lots of support from Locals and regular visitors of the Farm Park.” Casa Design architect Chris added: “It has taken two years to get to this stage, with ious consultations with the Planning Department and the Ayrshire Roads Alliance. The owners of the Farm Park have extensively researched this type of rural nursery, tied in with farm parks elsewhere in the UK and are very excited about the project. “It was very disappointing that the Planning Department decided to refuse the application in March this year on seven points which they construed as being contrary to the South Ayrshire Local Development Plan and Scottish Planning Policy. “We have found the Planning Department to be very negative with this application from the start. However, we are delighted that after an appeal, the councillors at the Local Review Body hearing this week saw the bigger picture and overturned their planners decision to refuse the application.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon pensioners 900 mile solo","story":"NewsTroon pensioner\u0027s 900-mile solo effort for charityGeorge Dunlop, from Troon, peddled across the country to raise money for Ayrshire Cancer Support, who offered him care and help 28 years ago when he had cancer.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie12:46, 25 SEP 2018Updated09:39, 26 SEP 2018NewsGeorge reaches Land’s End as he crosses the finish line \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pensioner with an articial knee has cycled almost 900 miles in the name of charity. George Dunlop, from Troon, pedalled across the country to raise money for Ayrshire Cancer Support, who offered him care and help 28 years ago when he had cancer. The 68-year-old cycled from John O’Groats to Land’s End and despite having an articial knee and suffering a puncture at Birmingham, George completed the cycle in 19 days. Cancer survivor George said: “I had never forgotten the help Ayrshire Cancer Support gave me getting to hospital, and I wanted to  the favour. “The cycle was hard going but I had something in my system that refused to give in. “I did it all on my own, without back-up, and it was a tremendous. “I cycled on canals and old railway lines and, to make up time, sometimes on busy roads.” George lived in Fenwick until 2015 and, following the passing of his we, moved to Troon.  Having been diagnosed with cancer in 1990 and survived the illness, he was motivated to complete the series of climbing all of Scotland’s 282 Munros.

Mark Crane insists the rising star from Buckinghamshire will curb his temper during this week\u0027s clash in Paris. It comes as the spotlight shines on Europe\u0027s underdogs and their ability to perform against a formidable American line-up. But Crane, who has proved a lethal partner for Hatton since taking his bag earlier this year, believes Hatton will thrive in the Paris pressure cooker. He said: People have a perception of Tyrrell from the TV and view him as a fiery character. Away from that he\u0027s actually quite dferent and we get on incredibly well, which is why it works on the course. He wears his heart on his sleeve and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that. I guess I\u0027m there as the calming influence! The pair have joined forces to register top ten finishes in the US Open and PGA Championship this season. And Crane, 36, who runs Prestwick\u0027s Bar Central, is expecting another big performance. He said: Everyone is tipping the Americans but I’m not sure why they’re favourites. The Europeans know this course well and being accurate off the tee will be vital. Do the Americans have a formidable looking team? Sure. But we also have plenty of guys at the top of their game and it\u0027s going to be an incredible contest.  The appearance marks Crane\u0027s second Ryder Cup, following his debut in 2016 at Hazeltine carrying the bag of Chris Wood. Meanwhile, Barassie greenkeeper Kerr Rowan is among an army of 180 course staff working at Le Golf National. The 39-year-old, now a course manager in Gothenburg, Sweden, said: “It’s a huge honour. “Any golf fan would give their right arm to be involved in what is the pinnacle of our sport. “The rough is long and will undoubtedly favour the Europeans. “But you look at the line-up coming across from America and have to say they are worthy favourites.” Kerr, who grew up playing Royal Troon, has been drafted in by friend, Alejandro Reyes, who is course manager at the Ryder Cup venue. Kerr said: “This will be the second Ryder Cup I’ve worked at and nothing compares to the event. “I’m on holes two, three, 13 and 14 and some of the stuff they’ve done with the course is incredible. “It’s been totally stripped back and rebuilt just for this week.” The event kicks off on Friday and is live on Sky Sports from 6.30am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnRyder CupTroonPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"surge-of-activity-in-borders-schools","story":"THE latest data published by sportscotland shows that Active Schools is going from strength to strength with national figures at an all-time high and 7.3 million participant sessions delivered in 2017/18, an increase of six percent from 2016/17.\nContributing to the national figures, Scottish Borders Council ran 211,179 participant sessions in the last year, and 8,398 inidual children and young people took part in a whole range of sports and physical activities in those sessions.\nThere has been a two percent increase overall in the percentage of the school roll now participating in Active Schools sessions nationally, and a six percent increase in the number of activity sessions, 10,789 of those sessions delivered in the Scottish Borders.\nMel Young, Chair of sportscotland, said: \"It\u0026rsquos really encouraging to see the continued growth in participation in Active Schools activities across the country.\n\"The success of Active Schools is the result of strong local partnerships between Active Schools teams, school staff, sports development teams in local authorities, regional managers from the governing bodies, and local sports clubs.

Holyrood as part of his campaign.\nAdult adoption is currently legal in countries such as Canada, the US, Japan, Germany and Spain.\nAhead of my appearance at the \n@SP_Petitions\nCommittee, give this blog by \n@ScotParl\n\u0027s Information Centre a read: \nhttps:t.co/9nMBYtPnon\n#AdultAdoption\n\u0026mdash Nathan Sparling  \nSeptember 25, 2018\nMr Sparling said the Scottish Government could use its forthcoming Family Law Bill to make the change, and added he will urge MSPs on the Public Petitions Committee to back that call.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoHaving been brought up by my mum until the age of 12, my stepfather came into my le and raised me as his own.\n\u0026ldquoUnfortunately, due to the law that limits adoption to those under 18, when it came to looking into this as an option I was unable to take it forward.\nAfter raising the issue in the press, Mr Sparling said a number of people in the same situation had got in touch with him.\nHe said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThe convention of human rights enshrines the right to family le in Scots Law, however many feel that this right is not realised  you want to be adopted beyond the age of 18.\n\u0026ldquoFamily le and the sense of belonging to a family are important features in our everyday lives, and therefore the law has to change to allow for people over the age of 18 to be adopted by their step-parents or foster parents.\n.push,i[r].l=1*new Datea=s.createElement,m=s.getElementsByTagName[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBeforegagagagagagagagagaga, \u0027title\u0027: \u0027MSPs hear plea for law reform to

submarine hunter has landed in Kintyre.The \u0026#8216Air Ace of Argyll \u0026#8211 Airships in the Great War and the Story of Major J G Struthers\u0026#8217 exhibition in Campbeltown Library features a trove of items belonging to the late Major Jim Struthers, formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from Argyll.\u0026#8217The exhibition, which was launched in Oban in July, will be in Campbeltown until September 29, before moving on to Helensburgh and Dunoon.Councillor John Armour,

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.

Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.

When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.  Mr Lindgren\u0026rsquos funeral at Musselburgh Congregational Church and Seafield Crematorium was well attended by the community of Musselburgh and Fisherrow.  Representatives from many organisations he was associated with, including Musselburgh Rotary Club, Musselburgh Air Cadets and Fisherrow Yacht Club, were present to pay their last respects."},{"url":null,"title":"plea-for-volunteers-to-join-the-team-at-musselburgh-cab","story":"  Claire Grehan, volunteer support officer, said sometimes there could be three or four volunteer advisers on duty but the busy High Street office was down to just one that day. The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.  She interviews the recruits, who, after initial training, get to \u0026lsquoshadow\u0026rsquo a general adviser before going it alone with support from the session supervisor.  Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is interesting and is good  you can be of some use to people.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom at the CAB for half a day twice a week.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

Dunbar Cement Plant, which employs more than 140 people and contributes \u0026pound8 million to the local economy each year, has now been given the go-ahead to create a cement mill grinding station, storage silo and ious other facilities.  According to the planning officer\u0026rsquos report: \u0026ldquoIn a supporting statement submitted with the application it is stated that the proposal is part of Tarmac\u0026rsquos long-term internal upgrade and modernisation programme at Dunbar cement works.  \u0026ldquoIt asserts that the cement mill is necessary to produce new grades of cement required for modern construction and the cement market.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed mill will replace two existing mills on the site and will be more energy-efficient and quieter than those existing mills.  \u0026ldquoThe supporting statement also asserts that the cement works benefits from rail sidings on both the south and north side of the East Coast Mainline.  \u0026ldquoTrains run under a load out structure that feeds cement into rail tankers.  \u0026ldquoAt present, trains are fed only on the south side using adjacent silos where train capacity is already fully used.  \u0026ldquoAdditional products must therefore be exported by road.  \u0026ldquoUntil the late 1980s, the northern siding was also fed by a large silo that was dismantled.

Mackintosh was a powerful advocate of Scottish devolution when that was an unpopular view in the Labour Party.

Jenner died on March 2, aged 63, having been minister of St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Only three more events remain, with the family\u0026rsquos initial target of \u0026pound1,000 smashed as nearly \u0026pound7,000 has been raised.  Susan, who takes on the Scottish 10k \u0026ndash which starts and finishes in Musselburgh on Sunday \u0026ndash alongside Duncan, said: \u0026ldquoWe are completely blown away by the generosity we have come across. It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.  Also this weekend, Barry takes on the Belfast City Half Marathon.  The challenge ends in Glasgow next Sunday  when Elaine and Susan line up for the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon.  Susan, 61, thought that Sunday\u0026rsquos East Lothian run, which stretches from Musselburgh to Cockenzie and back, would be memorable.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only one on Jenner\u0026rsquos turf.  \u0026ldquoI think that will be a wee bit special.

Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful.

Mr Lancaster added: \u0026ldquoIf we can make it happen, it should be a win-win all round.  \u0026ldquoNot only will it be great for the people using the co-working centre, it will bring more people and more trade to High Street and boost the local economy.  \u0026ldquoA study we commissioned suggests it will add between \u0026pound600,000 and \u0026pound800,000 to the area each year. And profits from the operation will be invested in practical support for local community groups and social enterprises.  Jo McNamara, chairwoman of Sustaining Dunbar, felt the funding boost was \u0026ldquoa signicant step towards our vision of developing something really special in Dunbar.  She added: \u0026ldquoWhile creating more workspace is essential for the area, what\u0026rsquos truly exciting is the way co-working spaces like this can bring people together \u0026ndash to share ideas, to collaborate and to build a stronger community.

Yard of Ale was originally formed in 1972 when Ian Lawson, Alistair McDougald and Colin Mackenzie all found themselves in Musselburgh.  Alistair and Colin had married local girls and Ian had taken up a post in youth and community education. He also later married a Musselburgh girl.  All three had dabbled in folk music in the past and regularly went to the Golf Tavern in Millhill, Musselburgh, to hear local folk singers, the Amulree Trio, Chris Egan and his daughters, Lorraine and Karen.  Alistair explained: \"We each would sing a few songs inidually in the trio\u0026rsquos break. One week John Gillan, the owner of the pub, asked  we could try and fill a night when the Amulrees were unavailable.  \"We had a practice, everything just clicked and Yard Of Ale was born. We played every Friday and Saturday at the Golf for three years and took our name from the yard glass which hung on the wall. We were encouraged by local comedian, Billy Nimmo , to try our hand in the club cabaret scene.\"  Yard Of Ale then had many successful years on the pub and club circuit, winning the TV Times \u0027Pub Entertainers of the Year\u0027 award. The band did well on ITV\u0027s \u0027New Faces\u0027 and appeared on many television and radio shows including STV\u0026rsquos \u0027Thingummyjig\u0027 and BBC Radio Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0027Scottish Radio Orchestra Roadshow.\u0027 During this time they also supported, amongst others, Matt McGinn, Hamish Imlach and Billy Connolly, and enjoyed an extended run in the Edinburgh Festival with the legendary Tim Hardin.  They then went their separate ways with Alistair involved in solo cabaret work, Colin playing with the North Sea Gas folk group and Iain, the original guitarist, leading a rock band.  In 1992 the group reformed for a charity show at the Brunton Theatre with good friends The Mimics, a successful Musselburgh comedy showband who had also broken up previously, to mark the passing of their mentor Billy Nimmo. The event was so successful that the band decided to give it another go.  Since then its popularity has continued to grow and it has been in great demand for concerts, folk festivals, corporate s, pub, hotel and club gigs all over Scotland and when on tour in Denmark and in Ireland.  Peter Gillan, nephew of the Golf\u0026rsquos John Gillan, then joined the band when Ian retired in 1998. Having spent many years playing solo as a singer and guitarist on the folk and country scenes, his experience added yet another dimension to the band.  Walter Mowat joined Yard Of Ale in 2015 when Colin retired. Over the years he has played in a number of folk and bluegrass bands and also plays violin in the Really Terrible Orchestra.  Ian and Colin still occasionally feature with the band as deputies or for larger concerts.  Alistair and Ian each have two sons who were brought up and educated in Musselburgh.  Alistair\u0026rsquos sons were both taught at the Burgh School by Susan Macintosh, Peter\u0026rsquos we.  Peter started his working le at Brunton\u0026rsquos Wiremill and still works for Brunton Aero products as it is now. He has also become a leading light in the Musselburgh Athletic FC\u0026rsquos 1934 Club.  Alistair was a director for 20 years of the now defunct Musselburgh Fair Day Association which ran the annual trotting at Musselburgh racecourse. He also ran a youth club for a number of years in Northesk Church and was chairman of the Musselburgh Domino League for a few years.

The 67-year-old from Ardtalnaig, Perth and Kinross, says she knows there will come a time when she won\u0026rsquot recognise their faces or know who they are.  The considerate grandmother is also writing them each a letter before her memory deteriorates.  Although she was diagnosed with the \"horrible\" illness, Olive says she still remains determined to make the most of her le while she\u0027s able.  She said: \"I was born in Scotland and in my family it was always a tradition that once you turned 21 you would receive a key - it\u0027s an old-fashioned thing.  \"I did the same thing for my kids.  \"So because of my personal experience I felt it was a good idea to do the same for my grandkids.  \"But because I have vascular dementia I\u0027ve had to prepare it early. I went to an antic store in Edinburgh to get the keys for them.  \"And I\u0027m going to write letters to all of them too.  \"I really hope they will appreciate this special tradition and that they will also do it with their own children someday.\"  Olive has been married to Ronnie, 74, for 41 years and she still keeps a close bond with her three children - Douglas, 46, Alene, 48, and Christopher, 43.  Her six grandchildren are Andrew, 17, Colin, 12, twins Liam and Connor, eight, Luka, seven, and Isla, four.  When she was first diagnosed with the illness, Olive said she felt her le had suddenly stopped.  She said: \"When I first found out I was fed up and depressed, I didn\u0027t want to talk about it with anyone.  \"I eventually sucked it all up and I thought  I decide to give up then I would have already been defeated.  \"You just never know which part of your brain will go first but I will enjoy today and worry about tomorrow later.\"  When Olive realised she was no longer good at mental arithmetic and struggled to remember words, she took it upon herself to find out  she had dementia - as there is a family history of the condition on the female side.  That was in 2012 when she was 61 and had ed to Scotland to retire after 40 years in Canada.  The gran-of-six was referred for tests and, aged 63, was told she had a 10 per cent memory loss at that stage.  In 2015, following further tests, she was officially diagnosed with vascular dementia.  Recently, Olive, who previously managed a care home, completed a mammoth trek to raise money for pioneering research.  On May 1 Olive started walking the famous Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route through France and northern Spain with her husband, Ronnie, for Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK.  Walking a minimum of 10km each day, the couple took two months to complete the 780km route \u0026ndash a month quicker than planned.  She said: \"I was looking for ideas for something we could do to raise money.  \"There are some things I can\u0026rsquot do, but I watched the film The Way, starring Martin Sheen, where they trek the Comino de Santiago route, and I thought \u0026lsquoI can walk, let\u0026rsquos go for that\u0026rsquo.  \"The trek was very tough, but we got stronger and stronger each day.  \"The hardest point was early on when we both got sick.  \"Because we were focused on walking, we didn\u0026rsquot realise how ill we were. We had to stop and rest for three days.\"  Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia and occurs when blood flow to the brain becomes reduced.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8712035.jpg?type=article-full","title":"discover-ten-hidden-gems-in-dumfries-and-galloway","story":"  Here we highlight ten hidden gems in the area that are well worth a visit.\u0026nbsp  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Blackaddie Country House Hotel  The four star Blackaddie House Hotel is\u0026nbspa great place to relax and stay overnight or of course longer.

It has strong association with the renowned Scottish poet Robert Burns, who wrote several pieces specically for its stage.  The theatre saw multiple changes of ownership during the first half of the 20th Century, before being bought by the Guild of Players in 1959.    The Guild managed to secure support from new sources and instead of planning on building new facilities upwards, they looked towards expanding outwards. Adjacent buildings were purchased, and renovation work began in 2014, completed by the end of 2015. The newly refurbished building includes several new spaces while maintaining many of the historic features, ushering Scotland\u0026rsquos oldest theatre into the 21st Century.  Attend one of the touring productions presented throughout the year, which includes live music, stand-up comedy and theatrical dramas. The Guild of Players presents a regular season of four shows, as well as a family-friendly Christmas pantomime.    Grab a drink at the bar before the show or enjoy a mean from the customised theatre menus at nearby restaurants. Want to get hands-on at the theatre? You can participate in one of the workshops or join our group of fantastic volunteers and help build sets and design costumes.  Getting there:  The Theatre Royal is located on the edge of Dumfries\u0026rsquo main shopping district, a short walk from the Dumfries railway station. It\u0026rsquos a 1.5-hour train journey to Dumfries from Glasgow or just under one hour\u0026rsquos drive from Carlisle Airport.

From family portraits to pet portraits and landscapes, Jane uses only the highest quality materials. Once completed, she can arrange for work to be framed to suit inidual preferences.    Jane\u0027s artwork is unique in more ways than one. She is\u0026nbspthe only Scot who has achieved full membership to both the Hilliard Society of Miniature Painters and the Royal Society of Miniature Painters Sculptors and Gravers , and who lives and works in Scotland.  She is currently working on a project for the RMS which will take up to two years to complete.

The physical control necessary to keep absolutely still while working can be very tiring. Yet Jane\u0027s passion for her work means she would always choose this lestyle, with all its challenges.\u0026nbsp  Jane\u0026rsquos home/studio is in the small harbour town of Kirkcudbrightshire on the shores of the River Dee.\u0026nbsp  The studio is open every Friday throughout the year or customers can call first and arrange a visit.

And so it goes on \u0026hellip and on \u0026hellip until Judgement Day.  The sprawl of referenda facing us makes the map of New York\u0026rsquos subway system seem understandable. Labour members want a second referendum, a People\u0026rsquos Vote, on the Brexit deal, which may, or may not, include a question about staying in the EU. However, Labour won\u0026rsquot allow Scotland to have a second independence referendum. How does that work? A second referendum on the EU is okay, but not a second referendum on independence? That\u0026rsquos a straight-up fail in logic class.  Then we come to the SNP \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a big push for the First Minister to back a second People\u0026rsquos Vote, but she\u0026rsquos not committing. That\u0026rsquos probably because the party is committed to a second Scottish independence referendum \u0026ndash although, when that might be, we don\u0026rsquot know \u0026ndash and some worry a People\u0026rsquos Vote will set the precedent that a future independence referendum can be overturned.  But that doesn\u0026rsquot make sense either. If pro-independence folk push for a second independence referendum, then why shouldn\u0026rsquot Unionists push for a third in the event the No side loses, or push for a People\u0026rsquos Vote on any independence \u0026ldquodeal? If you want a second indyref, then why not back a second EU vote? Why not a third vote on Brexit called by the Brexiters  they lose a People\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash why not just keep going until I have grandchildren in middle age? Why not just keep going until we are all driven stark staring mad?  We\u0026rsquore now playing referendum Jenga \u0026ndash piling up phoney choice on phoney choice in a rickety tower that cannot stay stable, and it\u0026rsquos democracy which is at risk of tumbling down.  I spit my curse on referenda not because of sour grapes \u0026ndash my side got beaten in two votes. I support Scottish independence, and I support remaining in Europe. I spit my curse on referenda because I see more of them coming in the future, and  we think we\u0026rsquore ided and unhappy now, wait and see how we feel when we\u0026rsquove been through one or two or three more.  Let\u0026rsquos stick with losers like me for a moment. We got beaten 45-55 over independence and 48-52 over Europe. Look at those margins. In Scotland, 45 per cent of the population were left with their dreams crushed. In the UK, 48 per cent had their world pulled from under them. Should 55 per cent of the population have the right to leave 45 per cent sitting in the corner crying? Should 52 per cent have the power to trash the house of the other 48 per cent?  This is the tyranny of the majority \u0026ndash and I\u0026rsquove long been thinking about what it would have been like  the shoe was on the other foot. I hope I would have felt empathy for a defeated Unionist or a Brexiter. Their political positions are not wicked \u0026ndash both are legitimate, decent opinions to hold \u0026ndash but the binary black and white of referenda puts the boot well and truly into the face of empathy. No-one walks in another person\u0026rsquos shoes when it comes to a referendum, you steal their shoes, tie their laces together and fling them over a telegraph pole in spite.  It may sound crazy given the public mood, it may even sound anti-democratic, for which I ask forgiveness, but perhaps this whole clunking winner-takes-all referenda path we\u0026rsquore on is deeply damaging to democracy. No matter what side of the fence you sit on \u0026ndash pro-independence, pro-Union pro-Europe, anti-Europe \u0026ndash you cannot say that the choices we\u0026rsquove made and the way those choices have been acted upon has been beneficial to the common good. It\u0026rsquos a bitter mess from Caithness to Cornwall.  Would it be better  referenda were settled with a 60-40 win? At least then the utter crushing of the losing side would not be so deadly and isive. If 60 per cent of the population told me I was wrong over independence and Europe, then perhaps it would have been more palatable. When Yes lost I felt as  a dream had evaporated because I was looking to the future \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod lost what I never had. When the Brexiters won I was bereft as I felt part of my identity had been stolen \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod lost something very tangible. Pull a switcheroo, and imagine that Yes won, or Brexiters lost, and you can see the same unhappiness across the ide: Unionists robbed of identity, anti-European dreams dashed.  But the ghost is out of the bottle. We can\u0026rsquot stop this chain reaction of referendum leading to referendum, nor can we tweak the rules \u0026ndash once we\u0026rsquove started down this path the road must remain level. So, on we will go, vote after vote, a slim minority of people hurt and thrust into the cold, a slim majority gloating in victory \u0026hellip until calls for new votes start again.  This is a Naked Lunch moment \u0026ndash a frozen moment when everyone sees exactly what is on the end of their fork. What I see is that we\u0026rsquove embraced endless ision, that we\u0026rsquore happy to hurt the other side on an existential level, that we cannot empathise with those who hold dfering political views \u0026ndash and that is because we brought in the blind god of referenda to stand in place of the slow grind of discussion. Change happens, it always does, but over these last years we wanted to light a fire under change, to turbo-charge its engine \u0026ndash all we\u0026rsquove really done is blow the bloody doors off the car."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-dont-like-immigration-better-stick-with-the-union","story":"  Take the SNP. The ruling party has long been making noises that Scotland - and an independent Scotland in particular - needs an influx of working-age immigrants to keep its economy afloat, and earlier this year it made the case for Scotland taking control of its own borders regardless of whether it remains part of the UK or not.  The bid has met with a mixed response from the public, with respected pollster Sir John Curtice finding in January that 63 per cent of Scots wanted to keep the same immigration rules as the UK, while a report issued last week by the National Conversation on Immigration suggested that practically the same proportion  now back immigration devolution.  Part of the reason for the flip-flopping is likely to do with the focus on the benefits immigration brings to the economy as a whole, with little attention given to how it impacts on us inidually. Yet you only need to look at the state pension, a benefit every one of us should expect to receive sooner or later, to see the dference greater immigration could make.  It is no secret that Scotland has a rapidly ageing population and in its Sustainable Growth Commission report the SNP noted that while the country\u0026rsquos pensioner population is expected to grow by 28% in the next 25 years the working-age population will grow by just 1%. This matters because, contrary to popular opinion, our tax and national insurance contributions are not being collected in inidual state-pension pots to be paid out on retirement, but rather are being used to fund current pensioners\u0026rsquo monthly payments, just as future generations\u0026rsquo taxes will be used to pay ours. It also matters in the context of the independence debate because in the UK as a whole the pensioner population is expected to grow by 33% and the working-age population by 11%, meaning the need for increased immigration, while still there, is less pressing.  The implication of this is clear: without a marked increase in the working-age population, an independent Scotland would be unable to continue paying the state pension - a benefit we should all be entitled to in some shape or form \u0026ndash without taking drastic, and electorally unpopular, action such as increasing taxes or raising the retirement age.  We all know how popular the former idea is, and the UK Government\u0026rsquos plan to press ahead with the latter has met with signicant opposition north of the Border due to le expectancy in some parts of Scotland being so low. Increasing immigration, and so the tax take, would have the potential to negate the need for doing either.  Of course this is all moot for now, with a Home Office-commissioned report issued last week by the independent Migration Advisory Committee concluding that \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos economic situation is [not] sufficiently dferent from that of the rest of the UK to justy a very dferent migration policy.  There will be some in the yes campaign that say this only strengthens the argument for independence, but the problem is that those shouting loudest for a second referendum appear to be the least likely to embrace an increase in immigration on any scale, let alone the scale an independent Scotland would require in order to thrive.  It should come as no surprise that there exists a scepticism towards incomers when a hard-core of indy supporters so vocally hanker after a country that is ours alone. Indeed, ahead of the 2014 independence referendum St Andrews academic David McCollum led a study that found \u0026ldquoevidence of some  hostility towards migration on the part of the general public in Scotland and a possible link between nationalist leanings and opposition to \u0026lsquoOthers\u0026rsquo. This opposition appears to have crystallised into the backward-looking \u0026lsquothis land is our land-ism\u0026rsquo of the kind of die-hard secessionist who believes that screening Mel Gibson\u0026rsquos Braveheart at a rally will strengthen the indy cause.  Regardless of political stance, as an electorate we are always asked to make binary decisions - him or her, red or blue, in or out, yes or no - when the implications of those decisions are anything but black and white. In the normal course of events backing the wrong horse doesn\u0026rsquot matter too much because another election will always come along to let you change your mind. With referendums, however, the decision is far more binding, meaning voters will have to sacrice some of their beliefs in favour of other, more palatable ones.  While some in the electorate may have independence at the top of their wish list and will do anything to get the chance to vote for it, the truth is that  immigration is not up there with it then even the staunchest of independentistas would be better off sticking with the UK, in all its Brexity glory."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-to-reconsider-bankrolling-kezia-dugdale-legal-defence","story":"  After intense lobbying by the former Scottish leader\u0026rsquos supporters at the UK\u0026nbspconference in Liverpool, the matter was referred to Labour\u0027s\u0026nbsp National Executive Committee  and Scottish Executive Committee .

The change of heart followed the Glasgow Anniesland CLP trying unsuccessfully to get the decision reversed by tabling a motion for debate on the conference floor.  This was rejected on the grounds the matter was better dealt with by the NEC and SEC, something which could take several weeks.  Former Labour general secretary Iain McNicol agreed last year to the open-ended support of Ms Dugdale\u0027s defence of\u0026nbspMr Campbell\u0026rsquos action.  However Mr McNicol\u0026rsquos pro-Corbyn successor, Jennie Formby, cancelled the arrangement after legal fees in the case reached almost \u0026pound100,000.

The proposals are part of a five-point plan to revive town centres and stem their decline following the dficulties faced by a string of major retailers.  Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Shadow Business Secretary, said: \"Our high streets need saving from a slow and agonising death.  \"As part of our plan to rebuild Britain and breathe le back into our communities, Labour will scrap ATM charges, deliver free WiFi to town centres, introduce a register of empty properties, provide free bus travel for under 25s and overhaul the broken business rates system which is hammering retail.  \"Boarded-up shops and deserted high streets are a result of years of neglect and austerity. Our country needs to radically change course so our towns can thrive again,\" she told conference.  The high street has been battered this year by several high-profile retail administrations and store closure programmes.  House of Fraser, Maplin and Toys R Us have all gone bust, while New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare have shut stores.  Meanwhile, on the issue of cash machines, there have been widespread closures of ATMs with cuts to funding resulting in the loss of thousands of machines rural areas and Scotland have been the worst affected.  Labour pointed out how the number of people who relied almost entirely on cash had risen to 2.7 million, up by 500,000 over the last two years.  Research by Which?, it said, had shown that the loss of free-to-use ATMs would leave one in 10 people struggling to make payments, forcing consumers out from local shops and services.  Labour analysis has found that in the last three years alone 100,000 jobs in the retail sector have been lost. British Retail Consortium research also shows that a fth of British retailers are planning to cut the number of people they employ in the next three months.  Scottish Labour MP Ged Killen, who has been campaigning to maintain ATMs, said he welcomes his party\u0026rsquos commitment to ban ATM charges and ensure people could access their own cash for free.  \u0026ldquoIn Scotland, a free-to-use ATM is closing at a rate of one a day, he declared.  \u0026ldquoThis means every day a there is one less place to take out money for the school lunches or one less place to withdraw money to pay in local shops, noted the Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP.  \u0026ldquoNo one should have to pay to access their own money. If any government is serious about economic development in our towns and high streets, they need to protect the financial infrastructure people and business rely on.

He once referred to the concrete, subterranean galleries, opened in 1978, as \u0026ldquoan enduring weakness.  : More details and images of the revamp at the Galleries  Now, 12 years later, and after at least one false start - and accompanied by a \u0026pound5m rise in cost - the redevelopment of the National Gallery will begin next month, a three year project costing \u0026pound22m, to be completed by 2021.  The project was put on a \u0026ldquopause last March when the galleries\u0026rsquo first plan faced spiralling costs, many posed by the complex site: on a man made hill, in a major public park, under an A-listed building and above one of Scotland\u0026rsquos major railway lines.  Now the galleries  have unveiled a new conception of the revamp, which will create new galleries for the display of Scottish art, and a complete rehang of the entire gallery space.  The changes from the first plan mean that the new gallery spaces will stay not extend the facade five metres into East Princes Street Gardens, as previously planned, although it will feature a newly revamped entrance and pathways.  Sir John said he is confident that more than \u0026pound10m in funding, yet to be announced, can be secured.  : How, after a rethink, new National Gallery will be made  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat we have now is fully contracted price, and  we had pressed ahead with the original scheme, it would have been considerably more than \u0026pound22m.  \u0026ldquoSo we took the dficult decision to revise the project and recast it, and personally I think what we have now is a stronger concept.  Sir John added: \u0026ldquoThe rest of the cost comes from fundraising, and we have a substantial amount of that already, so I am confident that will be able to raise that. There is a signicant amount in already, and there is somewhere to go.  He added that he was \u0026ldquovery confident the project would be completed on budget.  Work will begin in October, and the NGS say that the galleries will remain open throughout the redevelopment project.  However, to enable excavation works to the galleries directly beneath, the notable Playfair Steps, at the rear of the National Gallery, will be closed for the duration of the building work.  The Playfair Steps, designed by William Henry Playfair, are an historic steep flight of steps from the Mound to Market Street.  For the next two years the traders who work in the route to the Playfair steps during the Festival will not be present.  The new galleries, with six large windows running the  of the new Princes Street Gardens facade, will have a \u0026ldquobroader look at Scottish art.  : How the \u0027pause\u0027 in revamp\u0026nbspwas revealed in 2017  They will feature the art of Allan Ramsay, Gavin Hamilton and Sir David Wilkie, as well as 20th century artists such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Stanley Cursiter, Raeburn and the Scottish Colourists Peploe and Cadell.  The plan will involve \u0026ldquoextensive new landscaping in the gardens, a large lt for art and people, as well as a larger shop, and a new cafe.  The galleries say that once open, they will have a \u0026ldquodedicate family day one day a week, and more volunteers working in the galleries.  The first sign of the revamp will be construction work in October, with new steps and paths by next spring.  : Arts News on Bloody Scotland success  Funds announced for the revamp are from the National Lottery, worth \u0026pound4.9m, and the Scottish Government, worth \u0026pound5.5m.  Dr Tricia Allerston, co-director of the Scottish National Gallery Project, said visitor numbers to the gallery have almost \u0026ldquodoubled in the past ten years but fewer than one in six of them made their way to the cramped, dark spaces which used to house the national collection of Scottish art.

Ms Thornberry also condemned the Israeli Government\u0027s \"racist policies and criminal actions\" as she gave her keynote speech in Liverpool.  She said: \"We all support the Palestinian cause, we are all committed to recognise the Palestinian State, and I stand here with no hesitation when I condemn the Netanyahu government for its racist policies and its criminal actions against the Palestinian people.  \"But I know as well, and we must all acknowledge, that there are sickening iniduals on the fringes of our movement, who use our legitimate support for Palestine as a cloak and a cover for their despicable hatred of Jewish people, and their desire to see Israel destroyed.  \"Those people stand for everything that we have always stood against and they must be kicked out of our party the same way Oswald Mosley was kicked out of Liverpool.\"  Ms Thornberry was speaking after a debate on Palestine saw one speaker defying the chair to whoops, cheers and scores of Palestine flags being waved in support.  Delegates chanted \"Free Palestine\" as a motion condemning the Israeli response to protests in the Gaza Strip was moved by Colin Monehen from Harlow CLP.  He said an \"army\" would be needed to remove him from the stage, prompting cheers and claps from many in the audience, after he was told his speaking time was up.  He said: \"If you want me off this stage, you\u0027re going to have to get security up here and they better send an army, because Eastenders, like Palestinians, don\u0027t go down easy.\"  Mr Monehen said the Palestinian people could not be \"left alone in the darkness\", saying their story \"must be told\".  He went on: \"I want us to send a message to Mr Trump that cutting the funding to the UNRWA, the humanitarian agency set up by the UN to assist these people in exile, born homeless, born stateless, in refugee camps, will not crush their spirit.  \"It will not lessen their resolve to  home. Expelling Palestinian diplomats will not make them disappear like a snowflake in the hot sun,\" added Mr Monehen.  The debate happened after the Labour leader threw his support behind a two-state solution to Middle East peace, saying he wanted a \"secure and viable\" Palestine alongside Israel.  Addressing the Labour Friends of Palestine conference fringe event, he attacked Donald Trump for moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and cutting funding for the UN Refugee Agency.  He also called for a \"sustainable, just peace\" with Israel after \"51 years of occupation\".  Mr Corbyn went on: \"But peace cannot be achieved with the existence of settlements, human rights abuses, and a disregard for international law by the current Israeli government, like last Sunday\u0027s demolition of the Palestinian village of Khan Al Amar.  \"The security of one country can never be achieved at the expense of another and Britain has historic responsibility towards Palestinian people, declared the party leader.  He added: \"We will continue to stand up for Palestinians, we will recognise an independent state of Palestine as soon as we take office.\"  At the same fringe meeting, Ms Thornberry echoed the party leader, saying an independent Palestine was needed, \"while there is still some Palestine left to recognise\".

Almost one in five  of those living in the worst off areas had been worried about running out of food over the last year \u0026ndash with 21% of single parents reporting this as a concern.  The findings from the 2017 Scottish Health Survey, which for the first time included questions on food insecurity, also found 7% ate less than they should and 4% did run out of food.  Earlier this year calls to top up child benefit by \u0026pound5 a week and lt 30,000 youngsters out of poverty were rejected yesterday by the Scottish Government.  Campaigners had wanted the SNP to write the measure into new social security laws, using newly devolved powers.  But in a vote the party rejected Labour\u0026rsquos amendment.    Scottish Greens health spokesperson Alison Johnstone MSP said it was time for the Scottish Government to rethink their refusal to top-up Child Benefit.  \"It\u0026rsquos appalling that in wealthy 21st century Scotland we have so many people either worrying about running out of food due to lack of money or actually going hungry because they\u0026rsquore strapped for cash,\" she said \"The impact of poor nutrition on people\u0026rsquos physical and mental health is well understood, and it\u0026rsquos particularly detrimental to children\u0026rsquos development.  \"I hope in light of the new findings on food insecurity SNP Ministers think again about a \u0026pound5-a-week top-up of Child Benefit and finish the job on mitigating the Benefit Cap, to ensure families no longer go hungry.  Almost 3,700 adults and just over 1,600 children across Scotland took part in the 2017 survey \u0026ndash with the findings showing increased consumption of fruit and vegetables.  Nearly one in four ate the recommended five portions a day, the highest total since 2003 \u0026ndash although the figures also showed that 10% had not consumed any fruit or vegetables on the day prior to the survey being carried out.    But on average adults in Scotland consumed 3.3 portions of fruit or vegetables, against the highest since 2003, with children 2.9 portions on average \u0026ndash the best since 2008.  The survey found 8% of adults had experienced food insecurity in 2017, with this defined as being a worry they would run out of food because of financial problems.  This affected one in five  adults aged 16 to 64 who were living alone.  The report said there was a \u0026ldquosignicant association between area deprivation and food insecurity in 2017, noting that 18% of those in the most deprived areas had been worried about running out of food at some point in the last 12 months, compared to 3% of people in the least deprived areas.  Charities Oxfam Scotland, the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, Nourish Scotland and The Poverty Alliance joined forces to set up A Menu for Change \u0026ndash a project aimed at tackling food insecurity and poverty.  Policy officer Mary Anne MacLeod said: \u0026ldquoThese statistics paint a grim picture of hunger across the country. Given Scotland isn\u0026rsquot facing a food shortage, this is clearly a problem of widespread poverty.  \u0026ldquoThe figures show 16 to 44 year olds are most likely to be going hungry. We know low wages, zero-hour contracts, frozen benefit levels and the introduction of Universal Credit are pushing more and more people to the brink.  \u0026ldquoWhen so many people are struggling to make ends meet you know something has gone badly wrong with the system.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why our political leaders must urgently fix the system, in our rich country no-one should be constantly worrying about how they\u0026rsquore going to feed their kids. We can do better than that. Everyone should be able to access the money they need to put food on the table.  A Scottish Government spokesman: \u0026ldquoNo one should experience food insecurity in a country as prosperous as Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe are directly challenging the causes of food insecurity by promoting the living wage and embedding a rights-based approach in our new social security system.  \u0026ldquoWe continue to challenge the UK Government\u0026rsquos punitive welfare policies and continued austerity, which takes money out of the pockets, and food out of the mouths, of the most vulnerable in our society. We expect to spend \u0026pound125 million this year alone in mitigating UK Government welfare measures.  \u0026ldquoWe have increased our Fair Food Fund to \u0026pound1.5 million this year, rising to \u0026pound3.5 million next year, to reduce and over time remove the need for food banks."},{"url":null,"title":"minister-blames-procurement-process-on-flu-jab-shortage","story":"  Public health minister Joe FitzPatrick told MSP that NHS National Service Scotland ordered its vaccine before expert advisers recommended changing to a new strain.

And he will say that Labour is ready to deliver \u0026ldquothe radical plan we need to rebuild and transform Britain, telling delegates: \u0026ldquoThe old way of running things isn\u0026rsquot working any more.  Mr Corbyn will say Britain needs a government \u0026ldquocommitted to investing in renewables, in jobs and in training, and will promise large-scale public and private investment in wind and solar power, as well as subsidies to make all homes energy-efficient.  The insulation programme alone would create 160,000 jobs alone spread across the UK.  Changes to planning guidance will aim to encourage private investment to double onshore wind power over 12 years, while offshore wind will be increased sevenfold and solar power threefold.  \u0026ldquoScotland would clearly benefit extensively from this level of investment in terms of jobs and living standards, and it is something that would be very welcome in Scotland, stressed the Labour leader\u0026rsquos spokesman.  Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos speech comes at the end of a four-day conference which has been dominated by Brexit but has seen the Labour leader and shadow chancellor John McDonnell set out a range of policies to reverse inequalities in wealth and economic power.  These have ranged from workers in the boardroom to employee shareholding funds and new taxes on second homes south of the Border.  Mr Corbyn will say: \u0026ldquoTen years ago this month, the whole edice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.  \u0026ldquoBut instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate Establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place. People in this country know \u0026ndash they showed that in June last year \u0026ndash that the old way of running things isn\u0026rsquot working any more.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why Labour is offering a radical plan to rebuild and transform Britain.  Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos comments risk being seen as an attack on former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who led the global response to the financial crash in 2008 with massive intervention to shore up the banks.  Mr Brown warned earlier this month that the world risks \u0026ldquosleepwalking into a new financial crisis because it has failed to address the causes of the previous crash. The former prime minister also said the world was moving into a decade of vulnerability and said tougher action was needed to prevent wrongdoing by bankers.  Aides insisted that the current Labour leader regarded the ex-PM\u0026rsquos decision to take action to avert a collapse in the financial system as \u0026ldquoabsolutely correct.  But his spokesman suggested the costs of the bail-out \u0026ldquowere signicantly higher than they needed be in the nationalisation of RBS and the stake in Lloyds, adding: \u0026ldquoAnd then, of course, the huge sums that were committed through quantitative easing and other forms of financial guarantees were done in ways which in practice have favoured asset owners and the wealthy in society and, of course, the austerity programme has been at the expense of the poorest and the large majority of the population.  Setting out his plans to invest substantially in green jobs, Mr Corbyn will say: \u0026ldquoThere is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change.  \u0026ldquoWe must lead by example.  Labour\u0026rsquos plans outline a range of measures aimed at boosting energy efficiency, among them proposals which would see \u0026pound12.8 billion invested in an insulation programme over five years. There would also be means-tested subsidies for low-income owner-occupiers and social housing, as well as zero interest loans for home-owners and landlords who are able to pay.  Universal energy efficiency measures \u0026ndash including retrofitting of old properties \u0026ndash would reduce heat demand from buildings by a quarter.  Mr Corbyn will explain: \u0026ldquoThere is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change. We must lead by example.\u0026ldquoOur energy plans would make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations.  \u0026ldquoThat means working with unions representing the workforce to ensure jobs and skills are protected as we move to a low-carbon economy."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-says-remaining-in-eu-would-be-option-in-any-future-peoples-vote","story":"  Ahead of his keynote speech today, the Labour leader was asked  he backed the earlier assertion by Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, who told conference: \u0026ldquoNo one is ruling out Remain as an option.

Among the more eye-catching ideas is to connect Edinburgh  with Belfast and Dublin through with a \u0026ldquoCeltic version of the Oresund Bridge, which connects Sweden and Denmark. Such a connection should be backed with fast links to Aberdeen via Dundee, so the benefits are felt throughout the country. The report also makes an interesting call for more powers to be devolved to the AGE cities to develop their own futures, citing Eindhoven in the Netherlands, which is said to enjoy far more autonomy than any city in Scotland.  Some may dismiss such concepts as impractical blue-sky thinking. But with Brexit around the corner, and no certainty on what that will bring, the time for bold thinking is now."},{"url":null,"title":"senior-labour-figures-distance-themselves-from-peoples-vote-option","story":"  Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Shadow Business Secretary, made clear the party would not include a new referendum in its manesto  a general election were called before March.  Her colleague Richard Burgon said  Labour were in power now it would be negotiating a Brexit deal.  The comments came after Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, on Tuesday won a standing ovation from Labour conference delegates when he said \"nobody is ruling out Remain as an option\" in a fresh vote.  The event in Liverpool voted overwhelmingly to keep the option of a new vote \"on the table\", after he explicitly said it could include the option of staying in the EU.  Mrs Long-Bailey told BBC Radio 5 Live that Sir Keir\u0027s motion, hammered out after a late-night meeting, respected the 2016 referendum result.  Asked  a new vote would be among a list of manesto pledges  Theresa May sent the country to the polls before Brexit day in March, the Salford MP replied: \"No\".  She added that a second referendum was \"hypothetical\", adding: \"What we have said is that, in a very extreme set of circumstances, nothing should be ruled out, and that includes a People\u0027s Vote.\"  The Shadow Secretary of State said it was not impossible Labour would vote to support a deal made by the Prime Minister but added the party was a \u0026ldquolong way away\" from anything it could back being produced.  Mr Burgon said Labour\u0027s policy remained that \"we accept and respect the outcome of the referendum\".  Asked on LBC radio about Sir Keir leaving open the door to a second poll, the Shadow Justice Secretary said: \"Who knows where history is going to go? The Labour Party isn\u0027t calling for a second referendum.  \"Labour has our own vision of Brexit, respecting, accepting the outcome of the referendum.\"  Fellow MP Graham Stringer, a Leave supporter, warned there could be \"real electoral peril\"  the EU referendum result was not implemented.  He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that Sir Keir\u0027s motion was a \"classic Labour Party conference fudge\".  However, Tom Watson, the deputy leader, backed the Shadow Brexit Secretary.  Asked who spoke for the Labour Party on Brexit, Mr Watson told Today: \"Well, very thankfully, for me personally, it\u0027s Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, and he did a brilliant speech yesterday the conference united around him.  \"So, we come of this conference very united with a Brexit position and that will probably be in stark contrast to the Tory conference next week,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-universities-slip-down-global-rankings","story":"  Edinburgh, Glasgow and St Andrews all lost ground in the latest Times Higher Education rankings of the top 200 universities in the world - while Dundee dropped out altogether.  The only university to buck the downward trend was Aberdeen, which jumped from 185th to 158th.  Scotland now has only four universities in the global top 200, compared to five last year, with Edinburgh in 29th place, Glasgow in 93rd, Aberdeen 158th and St Andrews 165th.  Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, which represents principals, warned investment was falling behind international competitors.  The sector has raised concerns in recent years that public funding does not support the full cost of running courses - leaving universities having to raise money by recruiting international students or those from the rest of the UK who pay fees.  Times Higher Education also raised concerns over the impact of Brexit with uncertainties over recruitment of the students and academics from across the EU.  Mr Sim said: \"Despite our commitment to excellence, we\u0026rsquove seen an overall fall in rankings for Scottish institutions. This reflects the ferocity of international competition from nations that are investing in higher education to drive economic growth.  \"A clear pattern is emerging between the level of resource available to higher education sectors by country and the trajectory of that country within global league tables.  \"This year, we\u0026rsquove seen Japan overtake the UK as the second most-represented nation in the rankings for the first time. We\u0026rsquove also seen Scotland\u0026rsquos number of universities in the top 200 drop from five to four.\"  Mr Sim called for sustainable investment to preserve Scotland\u0026rsquos \"critical advantage\" as a place to study, research and do business.  Richard Lochhead, the Higher Education Minister, praised Scotland\u0027s overall performance, but also highlighted uncertainties over Brexit.  He said: \"By head of population, Scotland has more universities in the top 200 than any other country except Switzerland underlining the strength and breadth of our higher education institutions.  \u0026ldquoIt is however worrying that Times Higher Education highlights that, in the face of growing global competition, Brexit poses a risk to the performance of our universities and suggests the UK will struggle to attract the best international talent and build productive research partnerships due to isolationism.\"  Aberdeen University welcomed the new rankings highlighting its strong recent performance in research.  Marion Campbell, vice-principal for research said: \u0026ldquoAt our core we are a research-led institution placing world class research, teaching and innovation at the centre of all our activities.  \u0026ldquoOur progress into the world\u0026rsquos top 160 reflects the excellent global impact in key areas of economic, environmental and societal importance.\"  Glasgow University said it was pleased to remain in the top 200 despite a decline from 80th to 93rd.  A spokeswoman said: \"The university remains committed to excellence in teaching and research, and to strengthening the international reputation we have established in the higher education sector.\"  A spokesman for Dundee University said, \u0026ldquoWhile we are disappointed to have dropped out of the world\u0026rsquos top 200, it should be noted that our position among UK universities remains largely unchanged. This suggests that increased international competition is the main driver of these changes.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8736321.jpg?type=article-full","title":"commercial-focus-why-aberdein-considine-make-mortgages-easy","story":"  Aberdein Considine\u0027s completely Independent Mortgage Advisers have access to all the top lenders in the UK on one screen and are able to advise on who really will offer you the very best mortgage.

Kevin Hobbs, chief executive of Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd , told MSPs that responsibility for the extra costs lay squarely with Mr McColl\u0026rsquos shipbuilding firm.  \u0026ldquoWe can judge that it will be costing an awful lot more\u0026hellip that is not our problem, he said.  Mr Hobbs also appeared to take a swipe at Mr McColl, saying pointedly that CMAL had been \u0026ldquoextremely honourable and hadn\u0026rsquot \u0026ldquomoaned and groaned about the contract in the press.  Mr McColl gave an interview to this week\u0026rsquos Sunday Times in which he said he was on the verge of taking CMAL to court over design-related delays.  The ships are being built by Ferguson Marine Engineering, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde, which Mr McColl\u0026rsquos Clyde Blowers empire bought out of administration in 2014.  The vessels should have been delivered this year, increasing capacity on the Ardrossan to Arran route and Uig triangle, but have been delayed to next summer and spring 2020.  Since the delays first emerged in July 2017, the Scottish Government has loaned Ferguson\u0027s \u0026pound45m of taxpayers\u0026rsquo money to ensure the yard\u0026rsquos continued \u0026ldquoviability.  Amid growing concern at Holyrood over the arrangement, Mr McColl, who sits on the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers, put blame on CMAL.  He told the Sunday Times: \"The construction process is slower because the ferries are prototypes. Because of this there have been additional costs which we have funded and which CMAL have refused to discuss. This is what has necessitated the loans from the Scottish government. CMAL\u0027s attitude has put our business under pressure.\"  He added: \"I\u0027m very frustrated with CMAL. They should have carried out more design and development work on this project before they put it out to tender.\"  However Mr Hobbs was emphatic that Ferguson\u0027s had bid for and signed a \u0026ldquofixed price design and build contract, and CMAL did not intend to pay any more.  He said: \u0026ldquoFerguson Marine along with everybody else bidding for that contract at the time, they\u0026rsquore private companies, and with a private company there\u0026rsquos risk and reward.  \u0026ldquoThey signed up to that contract knowingly and willingly, and as far as we\u0026rsquore concerned \u0026pound97m is what we have to pay.  \u0026ldquoWe can judge that it will be costing an awful lot more. Our assertion at this particular point in time is that is not our problem.  \u0026ldquoThat is the problem of a private company that knowingly and willingly bid for these vessels.\"  He added: \u0026ldquoWe feel we\u0026rsquove been extremely honourable. We haven\u0026rsquot gone to the press. We haven\u0026rsquot moaned and groaned.  Mr Hobbs suggested CMAL might not even pay the \u0026pound97m, as the contract allowed for \u0026ldquoliquidated damages, or compensation, for missed delivery dates and quality issues.  There are a number of things at the end of the contract which we will have to weigh up.  Mr Hobbs also said that although the two \u0026ldquodual-fuel vessels were the first of their kind built in the UK, they were not new technology, with 2000 such engines bought worldwide.  Mr McColl\u0026rsquos complaint was also challenged by CMAL director of vessels Jim Anderson.  He said Ferguson\u0027s had tabled the \u0026ldquooutstanding bid for the dual-fuel ferries on quality and cost grounds, demonstrating the firm \u0026ldquocompletely understood what was expected.  Labour MSP Colin Smyth asked  CMAL was to blame for signicant design changes.  Mr Anderson replied: \u0026ldquoThere have been no signicant changes in design. That\u0026rsquos quite clear. So what you\u0026rsquore reading is untrue.  Pressed on the cause of the delays and cost overruns, Mr Anderson said: \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos one you would really have to ask Ferguson\u0026rsquos. We have a clear contract.  \u0026ldquoIf any project which had a timescale of 31 months and 33 months is now being extended to 44 months and 52 months, of course there\u0026rsquos going to be cost overruns. It\u0026rsquos quite clear that  a project takes almost twice as it was envisaged, there will be cost overruns.\"  Asked  any cost overruns were related to design, Mr Anderson said: \u0026ldquoNone whatsoever.  CalMac managing director Robbie Drummond told MSPs it would have made a \"signicant dference\" to services  the new ships had been delivered on time.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0027re as disappointed as our communities are that that has been delayed.\"  Tory MSP Jamie Greene said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP knew about problems and cost overruns on the yet to be delivered two new CalMac ferries over 15 months ago but chose to say nothing to Parliament, instead a secret backdoor loan was given to the manufacturer.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos nothing short of a complete farce.  Ferguson Marine was\u0026nbspasked for its reaction to Mr Hobbs and Mr Anderson\u0027s comments."},{"url":null,"title":"sketch-jeremy-corbyn-rallies-the-socialist-faithful-saying-were-ready-to-take-charge","story":"  Hairs were standing up across thousands of Socialist necks as showtime with Jezza finally arrived.  After the Liverpool People\u0026rsquos Choir set the mood with the comradely anthem of \u0026ldquoHe ain\u0026rsquot heavy, he\u0026rsquos my brother, the roof almost came off the Liverpool auditorium as delegates shouted, whooped and cheered to greet the shimmering arrival of the Reverend Jeremy.  Needless to say, another anthem struck up immediately as JC slowly breathed in wave after wave of Labour adulation: \u0026ldquoOooooh Jeremy Corbyn! Oooooh Jeremy Corbyn!  One happy-clappy comrade a few seats down was clad in Labour red, including a red bowler hat. He was dancing around as  Labour had already won the election.  Of course, the party leader had to begin his Socialist sermon by thanking the workers \u0026ndash who else? - who had made the conference possible.  And to settle the troops down, there was a joke at Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos expense naturally.  Insisting, unlike the Tories who got their money from dodgy donors and shoddy business clubs, Labour\u0026rsquos funds came from ordinary honest types, Jezza insisted: \u0026ldquoSo I don\u0026rsquot have to play tennis with an oligarch. Labour trades in hope for the many, not favours for the few.  Another target was, of course, the Tory propagandists of HM Press.  The Reverend Jeremy insisted the freedom of the press had to be protected and pointed to noble Turkish and Colombian journalists who had been imprisoned for holding authoritarian governments to account.  But, of course, British journalists were dferent. Hiss. The free press here too often meant the freedom to spread lies and to \u0026ldquosmear the powerless, not take on the powerful. Hiss.  He denounced the Press\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopropaganda of privilege and said it could be challenged by ordinary folk taking to social media.  Jezza insisted Labour was \u0026ldquoready to take charge and appealed to the comrades to show solidarity and unity. When Labour was ided, he told the congregation, the only winners were the rich and their champion: the Tories.  There was an attempt to molly those in the Jewish community outraged by anti-Semitism within the party as the leader, his voice reducing to almost a whisper, recognised their \u0026ldquoimmense hurt and anxiety, and insisted the Labour movement would be \u0026ldquoimplacable campaigners against all racism.  And the Socialist hero went on the attack, lambasting the Tories for backing the right-wing authoritarian government of Hungary\u0026rsquos Viktor Orban, and of creating the \u0026ldquohostile environment that created the Windrush scandal.  This, declared Jezza, was a \u0026ldquonasty, cynical politics, that demeans our whole country. And there was another bf to Bozza\u0026rsquos chin as he decried the former Foreign Secretary\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquodog-whistle jibe at Muslim women over the letter-box burka row.  But arguably the loudest rise in volume came when Jezza announced that a Labour government in its first year would recognise the state of Palestine. Delegates rose to their feet and several Palestinian flags were waved as the conference whooped and clapped their approval.  Of course, the subject that hangs over all of us made a late appearance.  Reverend Jeremy denounced Theresa May for wanting to create a post Brexit dystopia where the rich flourished in a low tax haven and workers saw their rights destroyed.  Liam Fox, the Trade Secretary, was itching to privatise the NHS \u0026ldquowith a side order of chlorinated chicken.  Then the chief comrade raised another Tory bogeyman: Jacob Rees-Mogg. Boos echoed around the conference hall. The ardent Brexiteer, quipped Jezza, had expressed his personal faith in Brexit Britain by, er, deciding to base his new investment fund in the eurozone.  Touching oh-so-briefly on the Labour split on the People\u0026rsquos Vote, the hairy Leftie noted how Keir Starmer had negotiated an agreement on the subject between the party\u0026rsquos factions, saying how \u0026ldquogetting one in Brussels should be a piece of cake.  The final flourish had a central message: \u0026ldquowe\u0026rsquore ready to take charge. Labour, insisted Jezza, was offering a radical plan to transform and rebuild Britain into the New Jerusalem. \u0026ldquoTogether we can.  And that was it. As the screen behind Jezza showed people creating the message \u0026ldquoRebuilding Britain, there was an earthquake of cheering and clapping. The Socialist Messiah grinned broadly. More \u0026ldquoOoooh Jeremy Corbyn! chants.  Comrades, believe it: the day of the Socialist Revolution is nigh\u0026hellipOr maybe not."},{"url":null,"title":"college-lecturers-reject-25-pay-offer","story":"  Members of the Further Education Lecturers\u0026rsquo Association - part of the Educational Institute of Scotland - voted overwhelmingly to reject the latest cost of living pay offer.  Union leaders said the increase, equivalent to a 2.5 per cent rise over three years, would result in a real terms pay cut for lecturers.  However, college bosses hit out at the \u0026ldquointransigent approach to pay discussions.  In 2016 it was announced that lecturers would be able to earn up to \u0026pound40,000 under a new agreement to harmonise pay across the sector following a series of national mergers.  The employers side said the latest offer would take that to \u0026pound45,000 costing the sector at extra \u0026pound60 million.  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, said: \u0026ldquoThis vote is an overwhelming rejection of the pay offer and signies the strength of feeling of our members.  \u0026ldquoThis dispute is about a cost of living pay rise and ensuring that lecturers\u0026rsquo pay keeps up with inflation.  \u0026ldquoAt a time when the sector would benefit from stability, it is regrettable that management are conflating the provision of equal pay with a cost of living pay increase, creating a barrier to further negotiation.  Mr Flanagan called on college managers to  with an improved offer to \u0026ldquoavoid the risk of industrial action.  A spokeswoman for the Colleges Scotland employers\u0026rsquo association said officials were \u0026ldquodisappointed, but not surprised at the move.  She added: \u0026ldquoThe union has continually refused to engage seriously in the process and has demanded a colossal pay increase on top of an extremely generous rise resulting from national bargaining.  \u0026ldquoA pay rise is a pay rise irrespective of how it is delivered, so it is deceptive to try and conveniently forget the huge increases and improvements in terms and conditions from national bargaining.  \u0026ldquoIf the union continues with their grandstanding and mendacious claims they would completely undermine the delivery of the college sector jeopardising jobs.  The ballot saw a 60 per cent turn-out with 90 per cent of members who voted supporting a rejection of the deal."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-minister-confirms-talks-with-peoples-vote-campaign","story":"  Michael Russell, the constitutional relations secretary, told MSPs he had \u0026ldquovery constructive discussions with the campaign\u0026rsquos Hugo Dixon on Wednesday morning.  However he said the government would not back another referendum without a guarantee that Scotland would not be taken out of Europe  there was a repeat of the 2016 result, when Scotland voted Remain but the UK as a whole voted Leave.  This is seen by the SNP\u0026rsquos critics as demanding a guarantee that a similar result would be interpreted as a vote for Scottish independence.  Mr Russell revealed the talks with the Mr Dixon after being goaded at Holyrood by Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie over the SNP\u0026rsquos failure to back a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  Mr Rennie said of Mr Russell: \u0026ldquoHe and I have had talks on several occasions.  \u0026ldquoTo be brutal, what he wants is he wants me to back independence  he backs a people\u0027s vote on Brexit. That\u0027s what he\u0027s trying to get to and that is not going to happen.  \u0026ldquoSo the Cabinet Secretary has a decision to make. Will he sit on the sidelines or will he get behind the best chance of stopping Brexit, which is a people\u0027s vote?  Mr Russell replied: \u0026ldquoFortunately there are more reasonable voices who are arguing for this.  \u0026ldquoFor example, I had very constructive discussions with Hugo Dixon from the People\u0027s Vote which was an interesting and informative step forward.  \"That is the type of constructive engagement I would commend.\"  He added: \"I did note that [Mr Rennie\u0026rsquos] party leader... Vince Cable, at the start of the Liberal Democrat conference, demanded the SNP back the people\u0027s vote but also demanded that the people of Scotland should never be allowed to support independence again.  \"That is no way to win friends and influence people.\"  The First Minister has repeatedly said she would not stand in the way of another vote, but has never endorsed one, possibly because it would set a precedent for independence.  But with Labour party conference voting to keep all options on the table  Brexit talks fail and there is no general election, the pressure on the SNP to sht position has increased."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-insists-labour-ready-to-take-charge-as-he-sets-out-socialist-vision-for-britain","story":"  To fervent applause from delegates at Labour\u0027s annual conference in Liverpool, Mr Corbyn called on Theresa May to call an early general election, which he said could see him in Downing Street by this time next year.  The Labour leader said his party was \"ready to win, ready to govern as we were in 1945, 1964 and 1997 and would in power deliver \"a real alternative to the people of Britain a radical plan to rebuild and transform our country\".  At the conclusion of the four-day gathering, Mr Corbyn set out plans for:  *a \"green jobs revolution\" to create 400,000 skilled jobs in windfarms and home insulation  *workers\u0027 seats on company boards, and the creation of employee shareholding funds  *an end to the \"racket\" of privatisation and outsourcing  *public services with \"fairness and humanity\" at their heart  *a new tax on second homes in England to pay for house-building  *an extension of free childcare south of the border and  *a foreign policy driven by \"progressive values and international solidarity\", with no more \"reckless wars, like Iraq or Libya\".  Mr Corbyn declared: \"Change in our country is long overdue. Every month this Government remains in power, the worse things get  \"We will rebuild the public realm and create a genuinely mixed economy for the 21st century. And after a decade of austerity, the next Labour government will confront the challenge of rebuilding our public services.\"  At the end of a conference dominated by Brexit, Mr Corbyn confirmed that Labour would vote against Theresa May\u0027s Chequers plan and keep the option of a second referendum on EU withdrawal \"on the table\".  But he left no doubt that a general election is his preferred outcome, sending a message to the Prime Minister: \"Brexit is about the future of our country and our vital interests. It is not about leadership squabbles or parliamentary posturing.  \"If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland,  you protect jobs, people\u0027s rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.  \"But  you can\u0027t negotiate that deal, then you need to make way for a party that can.\"  Mr Corbyn sought to draw a line under the anti-Semitism scandals which have dogged Labour over the summer, promising to \"eradicate anti-Semitism, both from our party and wider society\" and telling the Jewish community: \"We are your ally.\"  But he made clear that he would not back away from criticism of Israel, condemning illegal settlements and the detention of Palestinian children as an \"outrage\".  And he announced - to sustained applause and the waving of Palestinian flags - that a Labour government would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it took office.  He issued an appeal for unity to the feuding wings of his party and called for an end to abuse on social media.  In a riposte to critics who accuse him of narrowing Labour to a Leftist cult, he insisted the party must remain a \"broad church\" and declared: \"Our movement has achieved nothing when ided...We are on a journey together and can only complete it together.\"  Mr Corbyn denounced the \"greed-is-good capitalism\" which led to the financial crash of 2008 and the political and economic establishment which \"strained every sinew\" to shore up the system which created it.  \"We can no longer tolerate a set-up where the real economy, in which millions work, is just a sort of sideshow for the City of London and for banks fixated on piling up profits around the world,\" said the Labour leader.  \"Inequality is not just a matter of incomes. It\u0027s about having a real say too.  \"That\u0027s why we are not only determined to rebuild our economy, communities and public services, but also to democratise them, and change the way our economic system is run in the interests of the majority.\"  He spelt out plans for all private companies with 250 or more staff to reserve one-third of seats on their boards for workers and to transfer 10 per cent of their equity into shareholding funds delivering employees up to \u0026pound500 a year and granting them a voice in corporate decisions.  But he assured businesses Labour would also deliver \"what you need to succeed and to expand and modernise our economy - more investment in our transport, housing and digital infrastructure, more investment in education and skills, so workers are more productive\".  Warning of the rise of far-right politics around the world since the crash, Mr Corbyn said: \"People in this country know that the old way of running things isn\u0027t working any more. And unless we offer radical solutions, others will fill the gap with the politics of blame and ision.\"  He declared that Labour was winning the public debate and now represented \"the new political mainstream\" with \"an alternative to the politics of austerity, of social ision and of international conflict\".  And he won a standing ovation as he promised: \"Where the Tories have ided and ruled, we will unite and govern. We represent the new common sense of our time. And we are ready to deliver on it.  \"United and ready to win, ready to govern as we were in 1945, 1964 and 1997. So that when we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government.\"  Brandon Lewis, the Conservative Chairman, claimed Mr Corbyn had shown at every turn how he was unfit to govern.  \u0026ldquoAll he offers are failed ideas that didn\u0026rsquot work in the past and would leave working families paying the price with higher taxes, more debt and more waste just like last time.  Mr Lewis said the Labour leader had confirmed the Opposition was \u0026ldquoopening the door to re-running the referendum, which, he added, \u0026ldquowould take us all back to square one.  Ian Blackford for the SNP claimed Labour offered Scotland nothing but \u0026ldquoeconomic chaos and incompetence.  The Highland MP said while Mr Corbyn might have been forced into saying he would not accept a no-deal Brexit, he remained committed, like the Tories, to taking Scotland out of the EU against its will and imposed a \u0026ldquoreckless plan to drag Scotland off a hard Brexit clf-edge.  He added: \u0026ldquoAfter a bitterly ided conference, dominated by rows over Brexit, racism, and sectarianism, Labour have shown they aren\u0026rsquot even fit for opposition let alone government.  Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrats deputy leader, said: \u0026ldquoOnly Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership could fudge Brexit this much. By refusing to unequivocally back campaigning for a final say on Brexit, Labour is committed to nothing.

The Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland is performing at venues across the country as part of its ‘Walking with Heroes’ centenary tour which is aiming to raise tens of thousands of pounds for Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.                                                    Fresh from another incredible month of spectacular performances at the world-renowned Edinburgh Tattoo, Scotland’s State Band, as it is also known, will be performing at the Beach Ballroom on Friday, September 28.

Lord Provost Crockett said: “It is an honour to welcome the Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland to Aberdeen. “We are very fortunate that the Beach Ballroom has been chosen as one of the venues for the band to play on its seven-date centenary tour. “I would also like to take this opportunity to wish them well in meeting their fundraising targets for the very deserving Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.”Starring in the Beach Ballroom show will be hometown heroes LCpl Mark Angus and LCpl Natalie Mair.                                                                                                         Both hail from Aberdeen originally, and the September concert will mark the first time either has performed during their military career in the Granite City.LCpl Angus, who has played the tuba in ious military bands during his 16-year Army career, said: “The last time I performed in Aberdeen was with the brass band at Cults Academy, so I’m really excited to be back home as part of the Walking with Heroes tour.”LCpl Mair added: “I’m looking forward to having my local fan club – well, my mum, sister and aunties! – coming along to show us their support. It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.                                                                                                        To accompany the centenary tour, there is also a CD – Walking with Heroes – which will commemorate 100 years since the end of The Great War, and honour those that served our nation so valiantly. The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

He was aged only 29 but during his short le distinguished himself as one of the foremost archaeologists of his day.Alexander Henry Rhind was born in Wick on July 26, 1833. His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank. He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Thursday 27 Sep 2018 4:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

She encouraged iniduals and existing businesses to continue the hard work with their projects as entrepreneurialism can come from unlikely sources.Cathy emphasised how the path of an entrepreneur should not be shied away from, that young people and businesses should be encouraged to grow and learn as they develop.Later in the evening, Andy Cameron MBE regaled guests with anecdotes about his le and experiences as an entertainer.Following the dinner, the chamber presented the award for Most Promising New Business 2018 to Ice and Fire Distillery.Chamber chair Stephen Sutherland said: \"This year\u0027s entrants to the new business award showed great potential and it is always heartening to see so much new talent coming through in the local business community.\"With so many great products and services on offer, we look forward to seeing how these businesses develop over this coming year and encourage those that weren\u0027t the lucky winners this time around to think about applying for next year\u0027s award.\"Out of a strong field of entrants, Ice and Fire particularly stood out to the board, with so many developments in a short space of time and a strong set of future plans for investment in the business.\"We were delighted to recognise it as this year\u0027s Most Promising New Business.\"Launched earlier this year by local entrepreneur Jacqueline Black and her family, Ice and Fire Distillery has already seen signicant success with its inaugural gin products \u0026ndash Caithness Gin and Crofter\u0027s Tears.The Ice and Fire team have a strong connection to the local area, representing generations of crofters and gamekeepers, and took the bold step to launch this new enterprise on recognising the need for their crofts to ersy in order to survive.Starting with small copper stills to aid in recipe development, the team quickly moved into small-scale production. Their efforts have already paid off, with demand for their gin exceeding all expectations.The first full-size bottles are expected to be on the market in October, and the team already have ambitious plans to expand into rum and vodka production.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, said: \"The business community of the north Highlands has once again proven its resilience and ambition in the face of continuing political and economic uncertainty.\"This year has given us much to celebrate \u0026ndash from ambitious new businesses taking their first steps to existing businesses growing and ersying into new markets.\"Not only that, we have seen some signicant opportunities for the area move forward over the past year, with work progressing on the Beatrice offshore wind farm, as well as the announcement of the UK\u0027s first vertical launch site in Sutherland.\"Our annual dinner has always aimed to celebrate the business community of the north Highlands, and 2018 has been a great year for the region.

Westminster itself would see its total number of MPs cut from 650 to 600.One ramication includes the expansion of the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross seat, which has Mr Stone of the Liberal Democrats as its sitting MP, to include a part of Lochaber.Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoThese changes would make our constituency a monster in terms of size.\u0026ldquoPeople have a right of access to their local MP but that representative can only do so much and only drive so many miles to serve the electorate.\u0026ldquoThe journey from Evanton in the south-east to John O\u0026rsquoGroats is 103 miles.

Ministers must now learn the lessons of the previous tendering process and make sure that they listen to local stakeholders and respond to the needs of our island communities.\u0026#8220This contract needs to drive service improvements and improved capacity on these leline routes. This needs to happen both in relation to freight and restoring the cuts to services on the Pentland Firth ushered in under the current contract.“It is imperative that the Pentland Firth and Aberdeen services continue to operate as one and are not ‘unbundled’. I also believe that we need to see Stromness and Scrabster as designated ports again under any future contract.”“Getting the detail right will require the minister and his officials to engage early and on an ongoing basis with the island councils, local businesses and other key stakeholders.

In the end, it was the kind auspices of the Harcus family that saw the OMS safely installed in Maitland Place last September.The early days of converting the former fishing shed to its current layout has taken lots of volunteer time and energy and will be ongoing for some time yet. In the meantime, the shed is set up with a tea/meeting room, a kitchen and facilities, and working space, and early projects have included the new shed at The Blue Door, outdoor musical equipment for Glaitness School and the livestock signs for the County Show park — amongst a myriad of others.As a self funded group in these dficult times we are grateful for those who have supported us: from the larger organisations including: Age Scotland, Cooke Aquaculture, Orkney Partnership Board Positive Ageing Delivery Group, Orkney Rotary Club, Orkney Seafarer’s Association and RVS Asda, through to each and every member of our 200 club, and everyone who has supported our fundraising events, including a very successful week in the Blue Door last week and at the local Shows.All are invited to attend the celebrations at The Shed at Maitland Place in Finstown, which will be open to the public on Saturday, September 29 from 10am to 4pm.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor. Normally I\u0026rsquom sceptical about these sort of competitions but this has been great. It\u0026rsquos an opportunity for everyone to take a look at what they\u0026rsquore doing. There have been lots of local winners through a competition run by Visa and we\u0026rsquoll have a pop-up workshop on social media. These competitions can sometimes give a helpful kick to improve things.\"High Streets minister Jake Berry hailed Alness and said: \"The awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding. This is a great opportunity to show your support for the hard work going on in Alness High Street so get voting!\"Sundeep Kaur, head of UK and Ireland merchant services at Visa, added: \"Alness High Street is a fantastic example of a high street that has made huge strides in transforming itself to offer a range of dferent experiences for locals and visitors alike.\"In particular, its entry highlighted the shopkeepers in Alness who have worked hard to provide an exciting shopping experience, with each committing to offering something unique and which offers choice for consumers.\"The shortlisted high streets will now battle it out in a public vote, which accounts for 30 per cent of the final scoring, and will then have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they seek to be crowned Britain\u0026rsquos best.Those interested in participating in the public vote can visit www.thegreatbritishhighstreet for more information.Inspiration for other Ross-shire High Streets?

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Thursday 27 Sep 2018 4:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However Scottish Water has been in regular contact with stakeholders and I will wait to hear the assurances given to the community next week.\"The event will run between 3.30pm and 7.30pm on Monday.Share your views on the proposals by emailing newsdesk@spp-group or writing to us at the address on our letters page.Thursday 27 Sep 2018 4:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The atmospheric walk is a magnet for visitors and local alike.The Avoch Primary School pupil\u0026rsquos mother Julie Mackay reported the \"nasty\" burglary on a community Facebook page prompting a run of comments \u0026ndash including some which suggested the culprits may have a problem with the natural area being studded with colourful wooden toy fairy houses.However, the effort to replace the items was considered a great success despite the dissident tone.Mrs Mackay , of High Street, Rosemarkie, said: \"We replaced the pink boot with the money that had been collected by the Panacea shop in Rosemarkie, which was around \u0026pound20. The shop owner Cornelia Hughes gave them to us at cost price and she also donated the wobbly-roofed house.\"Cornelia is seen by the children as the white witch of the Fairy Glen as she makes \"get well\" lotions and potions and sells fairy dust and crystals in her shop and she dresses up at Halloween looking quite the part. And our local posties Wilma Stewart and Sheila MacDonald donated the watering can fairy house.\"She added: \"We all went to Fairy Glen and the local children helped to glue them down.

Two years ago we tackled the seven-mile course when he was only six, this time we walked from Aultbea to Poolewe and have again raised a fantastic amount thanks to our generous supporters,\" said Tom.\"Unlike some Huntington\u0026rsquos disease charities 100 per cent of the money raised for the SHA goes to supporting families living with the condition. They leave research funding to others which, is great for families like us who rely so much on the support they offer.\"Since my we Helen was diagnosed 15 years ago they have been invaluable to our family and our caseworker Gordon Bogan has been immense in helping us cope.\"SHA supports Huntington\u0026rsquos disease families through a national network of specialists, a world leading youth support team and its financial wellbeing service.Huntington\u0026rsquos disease is a complex condition with symptoms that typically begin to develop between the ages of 30 and 50. It causes three main groups of symptoms: changes to thinking processes \u0026ndash a type of early onset dementia loss of muscle control and involuntary movements which lead to loss of speech and swallow, along with mental illness.Those impacted by Huntington\u0026rsquos disease may lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or make decisions and will eventually need 24-hour care. It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgThursday 27 Sep 2018 4:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

How would you react  Scotland became known as the slow man of Europe? The tag represents a novel twist on the albatross which has hung around our neck for decades, yet the notion of a nation plodding meekly on while its neighbours rush by does little to inspire a sense of progress. \u2028The presumption that proceeding at an unhurried pace is as good as going backwards has been one of the defining responses to the private member’s bill put forward by Mark Ruskell. The Green MSP is spearheading a change in the law that would bring about a 20mph speed limit on most roads in built-up areas. So far, it has been supported by dozens of MSPs, and Mr Ruskell said he has held positive discussions with Michael Matheson, the transport secretary.            A private dialogue is not the same as a public endorsement, and it would be premature to read Mr Ruskell’s proposal as a done deal, especially given the opprobrium his bill has inspired. The Alliance of British Drivers - owners of the snappy motto, ‘Don’t let them drive you out of your car’ - has declared 20mph areas as a “waste of money, or worse,” while Jamie Greene, the Scottish Conservative transport spokesman, dismissed Mr Ruskell’s idea as “ham-fisted” arguing that the current targeted approach of designated 20mph roads, carried out in consultation with the public, represents the best way forward.             Such arguments against sweeping, mandatory changes to the way we drive may sound familiar to motorists of a certain age. There was a time when the RAC, asked for its views on one of the most signicant road traffic policies in generations, railed against the suggestion it should be compulsory. “The time for consideration for such a drastic measure has not yet been reached,” it implored. “Strict enforcement would have undesirable effects on relations between police and public, many of whom would justiably resent prosecutions and convictions.”The issue at play was the introduction of seat belt legislation. The year was 1973. Halcyon days, indeed. Such a harrowing snapshot from the history books ought to provide encouragement to Mr Ruskell and his supporters. Their argument is wedded to any number of indisputable facts, the most convincing being a slew of research which shows that reducing the speed limit not only curbs the likelihood of accidents occurring in the first place, but drastically reduces their severity and, with it, the chances of people being killed.             Yet the inability to question such data has not prevented opponents of the bill from seizing upon other data to bolster their cause. Some have pointed to datasets produced by Transport Scotland as supporting evidence in the hope of having the legislation dismissed as a punitive and disproportionate step. Out of the 7,138 reported road accidents in Scotland, they point out, just 293 involved drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit, resulting in 23 fatalities. Such numbers, the argument goes, constitutes a small proportion of the number of accidents - and deaths - on Scotland’s roads. Statistically, this is indisputable, but the brevity of the counter argument is even more compelling. It goes something like this  you think 23 deaths is an acceptable price to pay for drivers travelling too fast, you are an idiot.In any case, trying to shape policy around  road traffic accident statistics is a near impossible pursuit. A rushed, selective reading of Transport Scotland’s bevy of spreadsheets would likely inspire the more excitable of our elected representatives to call for drastic change.             Nearly as many motorcyclists  are killed each year as there are pedestrians , but is that alone reason for a clampdown on the two-wheeled? Of course not. Close to 2,000 more male drivers are involved in accidents than women, but should we ban all men from getting behind the wheel? Well, it is tempting,  only for the possibility it may spark the spontaneous combustion of Jeremy Clarkson. The awkward, cloying reality is there is no one-size fits all policy approach that will address these issues, and that applies to the speed limit question. A 20mph limit is not suitable for all suburban roads, and it is important to recognise there are sparsely populated roads which serve as crucial arteries. Indeed, Mr Ruskell’s bill recognises this, and would grant local authorities powers to exempt ious roads from the 20mph limit. Scotland has a commendable record in reducing the number of road fatalities and serious accidents. In 2006, there were 293 deaths. That number plummeted to just 175 in 2016, despite the fact the intervening decade saw an increase of around 350,000 licensed vehicles.             But progress cannot invite complacency, not when there are so many other lives that could be saved. The majority of us are drivers, and a similar proportion, I like to think, are reasonable, considerate people. Yet these two welcome facts are not always compatible.Provided Mr Ruskell can navigate his bill through Holyrood, its success will likely depend on an advertising blitz to raise awareness and bring about attitudinal shts. It happened in 1967 when the first drink driving limit was introduced, and again in 1983 when front seatbelt wearing regulations became mandatory. One day, I hope, Scotland will take pride its slow man of Europe, but will it take time and perseverance. Just ask the tortoise.          \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797445.1537949830!/image/image.jpg","title":"economic experts back nicola sturgeon s call to delay brexit","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

To enable firms to prepare and develop contingency plans it is vital that a deal is reached. Should this require more time to negotiate a workable solution, then so be it.: Theresa May: It’s my Brexit deal or no deal at all“Extending the Article 50 negotiation period – but maintaining the same transition timescale to 2020 – may be unpalatable for some but could be essential to protect jobs and livelihoods.”While the Fraser of Allander Institute said it expected economic growth of 1.3 per cent this year for Scotland, followed by 1.4 per cent  in both 2019 and 20202, it stressed there was a  “heightened degree of uncertainty” about forecasts at the current time.            “Our forecasts are based upon a broad-based agreement between the UK and the EU,” the report said.“Should this not happen, then our forecasts are likely to change signicantly.”The report was published after MSPs debated the impact of Brexit on trade. Scottish trade minister Ivan McKee said Holyrood and the Scottish Government must have a say in the deals, but claimed he was not demanding any vetos over them.The minister continued: “The Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament must have a guaranteed role in all stages of the formulation, negotiation, agreement and implementation of future trade deals.”            He denied Scottish Conservative claims this means the Scottish Government is seeking any vetos over UK-wide trade agreements.Brexit Secretary Michael Russell said: “The Scottish Government has consistently argued that the best option for Scotland is to stay in the EU or, failing that, to stay in the European single market or customs union, which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone.“But we should not be faced with a choice between no-deal and a ‘blind Brexit’, with no signicant detail on future trade relationships. That means – as the First Minister has called for – that an extension to the Article 50 period must be on the table, and we welcome the Fraser of Allander Institute support for that position. This report could not be clearer about the economic harm and chaos which could ensue from not reaching a deal.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn tells labour get ready for government within a year","story":"                Mr Corbyn said Labour would vote down Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal and force a general election, warning the Prime Minister: \"If you can\u0026rsquot negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can, and will.\"            The Labour leader sought to appeal to alienated and angry voters left behind by the UK economy, promising a \"radical plan to rebuild and transform our country\", including handing over shares in public companies to their employees.            : Jeremy Corbyn: Labour\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquogreen revolution\u0026rsquo will bring UK 400,000 jobsBut Mr Corbyn risked inflaming existing controversies within Labour, stopping short of issuing an apology in the long-running row over his handling of antisemitism claims, and pledging that a Labour government would immediately recognise the state of Palestine.\"When we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government,\" Mr Corbyn said at the end of a speech interrupted by applause and cheers over 100 times. \"Let every constituency, every community know Labour is ready.\"Closing a conference that saw Labour signicantly sht its policy on Brexit, embracing the possibility of a second EU referendum, Mr Corbyn appeared reluctant to widen isions on an issue that splits his party.The Labour leader confirmed his party would \"vote against the Chequers plan or whatever is left of it and oppose leaving the EU with no deal\", adding that a no deal Brexit would be \"inconceivable\" and \"a national disaster\".

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure.

That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion.

A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €60. \nLike Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. \nIf the film ‘Black 47’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the 1790s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In 1861 the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘Kilkenny  Moderator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:\n“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” \nThe recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.\nStudents of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. \nThe book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of 1,000 rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties 1865-92’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. \nThis is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8646221.1537865908!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley dinner saw council sponsor 1 500 table","story":"\nDUP MP Ian Paisley asked Causeway Coast and Glens council to attend a dinner event which saw it sponsor a \u0026#1631,500 table, a special meeting of the council has heard.\n\n                \nThe NI Auditor’s office is looking into the payment for a September 2017 event in Tullyglass Hotel in Ballymena, as part of a wider audit of the local authority.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8634725.1537953824!/image/image.jpg","title":"gall bog tractor run for diabetes uk","story":"\nLocal lady, Kate Bingham, has organised a tractor run to raise awareness and funds for Diabetes UK Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nThe Gall Bog Bar in Dromara will be the starting place for the Gall Bog Tractor Run taking place this Saturday, September 29 from 1.30pm.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nKate Bingham said: “I have close family members and friends, who are living day-in and day-out with diabetes and I know the work that is entailed in keeping on top of the condition.

Michael explained how the runaway success of his creation has seen views of up to 900,000 on the page, and that his characters are now set to come to le at the Waterfront in October.\n“I grew up with three older sisters, I’m the only boy and the youngest so a lot of my inspiration has come from my family, I’ve seen and heard it all,” he laughed.\n“The Facebook page has become so successful that it makes you want to do more, keep creating, keep entertaining people. I remember when I posted the first video and people were commenting underneath saying ‘more, more’.”\nMichael’s only foray on the stage so far was “when I was in Primary Seven in St Kevin’s and I wore my mummy’s white skinny jeans to play the Angel Gabriel,” he laughed.\n“I feel brilliant that I’m going to be performing all the characters for the first time at the Waterfront. I’ve never seen anything like this, like the following the site has, it’s crazy, but good crazy,” he said.\nThe show will be directed by Alan McKee, one half of comedic duo Grimes and McKee, and himself no stranger to the director’s chair.\n“Joe Rea, who is producing the show, spoke to me about Michael and said ‘this guy is very funny, I think there is a show here’. I ran Michael’s page past the focus group of teenage girls in my house and they loved it, there are plenty of songs and dance routines for everyone to take part in.\n“The fact we are putting on the show shows the power of social media, you can’t ignore that number of hits, that amount of likes and views.\n“Michael has a great ear, he writes exactly the way people speak, warts and all. He is a really original voice.\n“This is the first time I’m directing a piece that has come this way and it has really opened my eyes to look out for other things that don’t necessarily come via the traditional route,  it’s good people will pick up on it. It’s a version of word of mouth just how successful Belfast Girls has become which is the best publicity you can get.”\nBelfast Girls will be performed at the Waterfront from October 9-20.

At a crucial juncture in the Brexit negotiations it is hugely important that we sustain and build further links, cooperation and engagement across all of Ireland. I have no doubt the Seanad will be keen to hear what the Mayor has to say and continue to play our part in supporting the work of councillors across the country.\n\n“The memorandum between Belfast and Dublin city councils can act as a positive catalyst for cross-border relations and delivery. Given the role of the Seanad in relation to local government it is vital we engage with councils across Ireland who are very often at the coal face of political and community le.”\n\nSeanadóir Ó Donnghaile continued: “I am delighted too that the Seanad will also hear from the Mayors of Dublin and Cork in the coming months off the back of this initiative \u0026#8211 we should build on that engagement and facilitate more.\n\n“Ard Mhéara Hargey is a proven community, political and civic leader, I look forward to welcoming her and hearing her message to the Seanad on behalf of the people of Belfast at what is a deeply uncertain period for our all-Ireland economy, our peace process and the rights, wellbeing and prosperity of all our people.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"seb took his own life 5 days after cops","story":"\nA GLENGORMLEY couple who lost their son to suicide says the system is failing people with mental health issues.\n\n25-year-old Sebastian ‘Seb’ Haggan took his own le a month ago with a suspected heroin overdose.\n\nDad Billy and mum Sharon say they “tried everything” to help their son after he turned to drink and drugs before he took his own le after three previous attempts.\n\nSpeaking from the family’s Elmfield home, Billy told the North Belfast News how Sebastian’s le had spiralled out of control.\n\n“Sebastian had his mental health issues since he was a kid,” explained Billy. \n\n“He lost his baby brother Joshua in 2002 and then when his grandparents died, it hit him hard.\n\n“We were told he had to be re-assessed but at the end of the day, he was suffering from the same issues. He just went from a child to an adult.\n\n“As he grew up as an adult, he turned to a spiral of drink and drugs. He thought it was helping him but in reality it wasn’t. He didn’t know when to stop.\n\n“His doctor wrote him a letter, basically saying could he be housed in some sort of sheltered accommodation. It never happened.\n\n“As parents, we were desperate. He was either sitting in his room or out on the drink and drugs.\n\n“He couldn’t get out of the loop he was in. He needed serious help and he just was not getting it. It was a constant cycle that was going downwards. He needed professional help to deal with the grief he suffered.”\n\nIn April, Billy and Sharon were told by Social Services that it was not safe for Sebastian to live in the family home with his younger brother  and three sisters, ,  and .\n\n“As  putting him on to the street was the solution for a vulnerable adult who has addiction and mental health problems,” added Billy. “Social Services’ attitude was basically Sebastian is out of the house and the kids are safe. Now their big brother is dead. They are going to need counselling. It is just a vicious circle.\n\n“We are terried of a knock-on effect. What  someone else in our family decides to take their own le? We were given no help to find him somewhere. We had to find him some sort of sheltered dwelling to live in.”\n\nOn August 13, Sebastian’s West Belfast flat and the Haggan family home were raided by police who claimed they had a warrant to search for ammunition and weapons. The family have complained about the searches to the Police Ombudsman. Sebastian took his own le just five days later and Billy believes the raid set him over the edge. \n\n“Sebastian was out on the streets again after the raid when his landlord put him out. I got him sorted with a place in Ballymena. Five days after the raid, he killed himself. I think it was a trigger – he just could not cope with any more stress.\n\n“He was found with heroin paraphernalia lying around him. We are still waiting on official confirmation but it seems pretty likely he took a heroin overdose to end his own le. Earlier this year, he told his sister the best way to commit suicide was a heroin overdose. He was right.”\nBilly and Sharon have criticised the system which they say is failing people suffering from mental health issues.\n“Sebastian needed professional help but it just was not there. We begged for help from a psychiatrist and for him to be sectioned but nobody would do it.\n\n“We think he attempted suicide on three occasions before. After the second attempt when his sister rescued him from jumping off a bridge, the hospital said he was ‘stable’ and that he ‘wasn’t that bad’. \n\nSebastian himself was willing himself to get help. What more did he need to do? He’d just tried to take his own le. The authorities need to listen to families who are suffering. The system has crashed, it simply does not exist. Hospitals just cannot deal with the issue. \n\nPoliticians need to start doing something. There is a deluge of mental health patients at the moment and basically no help out there for them. Nobody seems to want to tackle the problem. More mental health staff and teams are needed.\n\n “We tried everything we could. At the end of the day, Sebastian was the one who injected himself and killed himself but it all goes back to mental health issues. \n\n“We won’t be the last family to suffer. I wouldn’t like to think what the total number of suicides will rise to. There are more people killed by suicide than on the roads now.”\n\nIf you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues in this article, call Leline on 0808 808 8000 or PIPS on 02890 805850.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"threes a shroud resurrection a triumph","story":"\n\nIT’S\n back on stage and it is better than ever before. Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.\nFor years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorley  has buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.\nMcSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.\nAs the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the 21st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.\nFuneral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.\nA special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.\nBasil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfast  and News Letter for some Protestant customers.\nA hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.\nThe undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .\n“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.\nIrena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,  abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.\nAfter a high profile republican and loyalist  are killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet? I will say no more.\nThree’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.\nThe play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.\nSpike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,  and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.\nThree’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.\nThe play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Army  page on Facebook, gaining 30,000 followers in no time.\nAs for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights?\nI can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.\n\n\nThree’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October 6. Tickets are available by calling 028 9033 4455, online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall.\n\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"west belfast man wont face second trial","story":"\n\nA man\n who admitted preventing the lawful burial of his elderly neighbour will not face a trial for stealing a second bank card from her burgled flat.\nSentencing of Robert Sharkey, 24, originally of Larkspur Rise, will take place next month.\nHe was convicted of 11 charges, including using one of Marie Conlon\u0026#8217s debit cards to buy nearly £6,000 worth of pizza.\nA remaining charge of theft of a debit card will remain on the books.\nThe remains of 68-year-old Ms Conlon were discovered in the bedroom of her West Belfast flat off the Suffolk Road last October.\nSharkey – a neighbour at the time – was arrested and subsequently charged with preventing the lawful burial of a corpse on dates between August 2015 and October 2017.\nSharkey, now with an address at Grays Hill in Bangor, pleaded guilty to preventing her lawful burial and to breaking into her home and taking batteries, tools and a coffee mug, and also of stealing both £50 in cash from her, and a First Trust debit card.\nHe also entered guilty pleas to six separate counts of fraud by false representation,  namely using Ms Conlon\u0026#8217s First Trust bank card without authority to buy food totalling £5,988.39 from Domino\u0026#8217s Pizza over a period from October 2015 to 2017.\nHe also bought goods from Sainsbury\u0026#8217s to the value of £3,279.80 from July 2016 to October 2017, and purchased mobile phone credit amounting to £1,030 from March 2016 to October 2017.\nSharkey also admitted using the card to pay Power NI £285, as well payments to the Land and Property Service of £573.83 in September 2016, and £586.20 the following September.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36596884.ece/e32d5/AUTOCROP/w140square/ks%20at%20Stormont%2002.jpg","title":"free belfast telegraph transfer test answer booklets","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong. We will continue to work to ensure that partner airlines are encouraged to serve our market in an appropriate and sustainable manner.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit 60 back special status for northern ireland in poll of 4000 online belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

blocks.\n\nHe told the inquiry he could not recall exactly how he heard about the scheme, but said he had not been told about it by Dr Crawford.\n\nMr Brimstone had had a biomass boiler to heat his

the RHI scheme.\n\nMr Brimstone will  to the inquiry on Thursday morning to resume giving evidence.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dupled ards council votes down proposal to light up town hall in pride

But instead, those who moved to quash this motion tonight have sent a negative signal that Ards and North Down Council is not dedicated to working for all.\n\n\"I am extremely grateful to all those who backed this motion, especially in the wake of intense criticism as others have sought to play politics with people\u0027s lives and also to the Rainbow Project and Stonewall for their help in drafting the motion, which included lighting of Ards Town Hall in rainbow colours to coincide with Pride Day.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dups ian paisley asked council to pay for 1500 table at dinner council chief embarrassed","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It’s for this reason we all need to work together to help victims and stop this unacceptable crime.”\n\nDS Campbell warned the public human trafficking could be going on in their own communities, and flagged there are a number of tell-tale signs to look out for.\n\nThese include:\n\n\nA person not being able to produce personal documents or a passport \n\nA person appearing to be under the control of others or who have unexplained injuries people living in over-crowded accommodation\n\nIniduals appearing not to have any cash as they are not allowed to keep money they earn. \n\n\nThe PSNI\u0027s Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Unit was set up in 2015 and has a 24-hour support line in place. \n\nIts stated objective is to \"detect, disrupt and frustrate organised crime gangs involved in human exploitation\". \n\nAnyone with suspicions can call the police service on 101 or the Modern Slavery Helpline 08000 121 700.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more than 250 northern ireland people aged over 100 and 37000 aged","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could become singaporestyle free port after brexit says business chief mckenzie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon. He was not able to tell them how he was going to get the man on the moon.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein rejects arlene fosters disgraceful claim mcguinness knew of rhi burn to earn incentive","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He led by example.\n\n“Any attack on his integrity in government is spurious. It’s disgraceful and it will be robustly challenged by our party. \n\n“The comments made before the RHI Public Inquiry that Martin McGuinness had prior knowledge of a whistleblower will be examined by the inquiry. \n\n\"However, Sinn Fein is confident that our position and the position of Martin McGuinness will be fully vindicated. Martin McGuinness is no longer here to defend himself.\"\n\nShe also said the claim was subject to \"an ongoing and separate legal action\".\n\nThe note claimed people were abusing the RHI scheme by running boilers 24/7 and all year round for financial gain.\n\nIt was passed to the head of he Northern Ireland civil service who also worked for the Sinn Fein politician. \n\nMrs Foster told the RHI public inquiry he knew about the contents of the whistleblower’s note, which she received in January 2016.\n\nShe said it was the first time she heard of the potential for fraud in the scheme, although the then head of the civil service Malcolm McKibbin had raised concerns with her over its financing.\n\nMrs Foster said she had passed the information to Mr McKibbin.\n\n“I knew that once I handed it to the head of the civil service, that it was being dealt with in the appropriate way,” she told the inquiry.\n\nA senior Sinn Fein worker, Aidan McAteer, has claimed in his written evidence to the inquiry the note “was not shared” with Mr McGuinness “at that time”.\n\nMrs Foster queried that during her evidence to the inquiry on Tuesday, and said  she did not give it to Mr McGuinness, she spoke to him about it.\n\n“My recollection is clear,  I didn’t show it to the DFM , I certainly spoke to the DFM about it,” she told the inquiry.\n\n“And in any event, the head of the civil service works for both myself and the deputy first minister, so I presume that the minute that was sent to Andrew McCormick…  it came into the DUP system, it would have went into the Sinn Fein system, so I would have imagined that Sinn Fein were aware of that document.”\n\nMr McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in January 2017 in protest at the handling of the botched green energy incentive.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn to set out labours brexit plan with eu chief negotiator michel barnier","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Corbyn is set to meet with the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in a bid to break the current Brexit impasse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe Labour leader will travel to Brussels with shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer with the message that no-deal is not acceptable. \n\nThe visit comes just 24 hours after Mr Corbyn used his Labour Party conference speech to say that his party will vote against Theresa May’s Chequers plan “as it stands” and oppose a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAhead of his meeting with Mr Barnier, Mr Corbyn said: “With just weeks of negotiating time left, it’s clear that UK-EU Brexit talks are in a perilous state. \n\n“Time is running out and companies are losing patience with the absence of any clarity from the Government.\n\n“Crashing out of Europe with no deal risks being a national disaster. \n\n“That is why I’m meeting EU officials today, and I will be urging them to do all they can to avoid a ‘no-deal’ outcome, which would be so damaging to jobs and living standards in both the UK and EU countries.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichel Barnier, EU Chief Negotiator for Brexit,\n\n\n\n\nMr Corbyn said that Labour would call for a general election  Parliament votes down the deal reached by the Prime Minister and Brussels, and told delegates in Liverpool that “all options are on the table”  that fails.\n\nBut Mr Corbyn did also reveal that Labour would back a “sensible deal”, saying he would support an outcome that features a customs union and no hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\nShadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner, appearing on ITV’s Peston show, said the party would be willing to make compromises with the Tories to avoid a no-deal. \n\nHe said: “If it means compromising,  it means you bending your red line to give us a customs union, we’re prepared to bend our red lines to give, to give this a deal.”\n\nFormer home secretary Amber Rudd, also appearing on ITV’s Peston show, revealed that she would “absolutely” support a second referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU over no-deal. \n\nShe said: “I don’t think no deal will happen. \n\n“I think that  we can’t get a negotiated deal, that the Prime Minister brings back through Parliament, then I think that we’re in completely uncharted territory.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nAnti-Brexit billboards on the northern side of the border between Newry in Northern Ireland and Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland \n\n\n\n\n“I think that one of the outcomes you might get is a Norway style EEA deal, and I know that ious colleagues are looking at that.”\n\nAsked whether she would support a Canada-plus type deal, the likes of which the Tory Brexiteer faction are calling for, she said: “No. I think there are a number of people, in fact I’ve talked to a few colleagues and I reckon there are conservatively about 40 of us who would not support a Canada type deal. \n\n“But to be frank there are so many reasons a Canada type deal doesn’t work, starting with the Irish border, going on to manufacturing that I think we can make those arguments. \n\n“But that just reinforces the point that there is an impasse  the two wings of our party face up to the fact that we have these elements that dferentiate us but the rebel group need to think again because I think we’ve only got one shot at a negotiated settlement.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"exminister branded a liar by former adviser over green energy scheme claim","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

It impinged on not only my integrity but the integrity of my family. And, as we will come on to, my we’s family. You feel a sense of guilt for that.\n\n“Jonathan told lies, he knows he told lies.”\n\nMr Robinson was then special adviser to DUP economy minister Simon Hamilton, at the department which was then running the RHI scheme.\n\nHe said Mr Bell’s allegation led to him being told some within the DUP thought he should resign.\n\nHe told the inquiry DUP leader Arlene Foster and special adviser Timothy Johnston spoke to him during the same phone call about the matter.\n\nMr Robinson said he felt that to resign would lend weight to allegations being reported about him, and insisted: “I had done nothing wrong – I was accused on the basis of a lie.”\n\nMr Robinson added that the phone call was not “hostile”.\n\nHe said he later spoke to Mr Hamilton who assured him he had confidence in him.\n\nMr Robinson said he stepped away from involvement with the RHI scheme in the department.\n\nMeanwhile, outside of the inquiry proceedings, Sinn Fein’s deputy leader Michelle O’Neill responded to a claim by Arlene Foster that the late deputy first minister Martin McGuinness was aware of a whistleblower warning about the RHI scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nSinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O’Neill addresses media over allegations made during the RHI Inquiry on Monday about Martin McGuinness \n\n\n\n\nMrs Foster told the inquiry on Tuesday that she made the Sinn Fein veteran aware of the whistleblower allegations when she received them in January 2016.\n\nReading out a statement in the Great Hall of Parliament Buildings on Wednesday, Mrs O’Neill said: “Martin McGuinness set the benchmark for good government and the fair and equal treatment of all citizens. He led by example and any attack on his integrity is spurious, is disgraceful and it will be robustly challenged by our party.\n\n“The comments that were made before the RHI public inquiry that Martin McGuinness had prior knowledge of the whistleblower will be examined by the inquiry. However, Sinn Fein is confident that our position and the position of Martin McGuinness will be fully vindicated. Martin McGuinness is no longer here to defend himself.\n\n“I can also tell you that this allegation is subject to an ongoing and separate legal action.”\n\nIt is understood the action relates to comments made by a dferent DUP member as to another Sinn Fein figure’s alleged knowledge of whistleblower claims.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"judge me on my values says michael d higgins","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

allowance of up to 317,000 euro a year has been paid to each president since 1998 that is not audited, taxed or scrutinised.\n\nThe allowance is paid on top of the 249,000 euro a year salary paid to the President.\n\nMr Harris said: “The showboating that we see going on by some on the PAC is growing a little weary.”\n\nThe Health Minister made the comments alongside housing minster Eoghan Murphy at the launch of the Government’s latest strategy to target homelessness.\n\nBoth Mr Harris and Mr Murphy questioned the timing of the probe.\n\nMr Murphy said the presidential campaign was an important part of Ireland’s democracy and it should be about vision and values.\n\n“We don’t want the opposition or other people trying to reduce it to a debate about who will stay in the cheapest

presidential expenses was made after questions were raised over the summer over claims of extravagant spending by the office including expensive hotel suites on State visits.\n\nThe political ramications of examining the president’s expenditure so close to the election on October 26 were brought into question by the State’s top civil servant Martin Fraser during the meeting.\n\nMr Fraser cited the constitution, which states the president is not answerable to either house of the Oireachtas or any court for the exercise of his office.\n\nBut some members of the committee argued the office of the president should be held to the same standard as other institutions.\n\nThe expenditure of the president’s office is 3.2 million euro per year, it is closer to 8.2 million euro when operational and other costs are considered.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"hamleys tips doll with humanlike teeth to be top christmas seller","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

price of between £15 and £25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHamleys said there were signs that imperfectionism was beginning to emerge as a trend “as children increasingly resist the pressures of idealised perfection in social channels and celebrity icons”.\n\nIt said £40 Crate Creatures, which have pointy ears, a naughty grin and glowing eyes alongside a “charm that will allow your child to be as cheeky as them” was part of the trend.\n\nSimilarly, the £80 Boxer Robot toy is “needy and fallible – bumping into things, falling over and sometimes saying the wrong thing”.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\"

players steal, deceive and fib to beat fellow competitors.\n\nVictoria Kay, head buyer at Hamleys, said: “We have cute, we have cuddly, we have fun, we have education, but this year in some of our toy categories we are also seeing an antidote to the highly polished perfectionism portrayed in many social media channels.\n\n“Importantly, these toys are being delivered with character, fun and cheekiness at their heart and we love them.\n\n“It makes for a wonderfully erse and interesting range this year – for kids and kidults alike.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\"

mythical pets called Pomsies, are also expected to be top sellers this year, as is the Elasti Plasti soft plastic toy.\n\nOlder children are expected to send sales of the latest Nerf gun – the Laser Ops Pro–Alphapoint two-pack – soaring, as well as the highly-anticipated £75 Lego Hogwarts Express.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe Jurassic World Chomp and Roar Blue

It’s clearly linked with how active we are, the food we eat and the amount of sleep we get. Screen time can displace physical activity and is associated with a pattern of unhealthy snacking. It also increases our children’s exposure to the marketing of unhealthy foods. We need to get this balance right and parents can make a start by reducing their own screen time.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nFor children aged 2-5, the weekday average was approx. 1 hour 49 mins and 2 hours 13 mins at weekends.  For over 5s, the weekday average was almost two hours rising to more than 3 hours at the weekends.\n\nCaroline Bloomfield, Health and Social Wellbeing Improvement Senior Manager at the Public Health Agency said: “Ideally, under 2s should have no screen time while under 5s should have no more than an hour a day. For older children, it’s important to agree set limits that suit your family and to stick to them. Screen time is such a part now of daily le that trying to cut down on it might seem challenging. Children love to copy what others do so  they see Mum or Dad on the smartphone, chances are they’ll want to do the same. Having wind-down time with no screens before bedtime and enjoying more screen free meals together are two good places where parents can make a start.”\n\nThe START campaign aims to provide practical tools and advice for parents, to help them set limits on screen time and to encourage the whole family to become more active. It is encouraging families to make a ‘play pact’ by committing as a family to pause for play and spend less time on their screens. This doesn’t have to be organised physical activity or sport and all movement counts.\n\nFor more information visit:\n \n\nwww.makeastart.org\n It provides lots of simple ideas on getting active in and around the home and ways to make a positive, healthy start.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derrys halloween music line set frightfully good","story":"\nThis Halloween promises to be a musical extravaganza with the  of the Samhain Sessions, featuring some of the finest Irish acts performing in the beautul surrounds of Derry’s Guildhall.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sessions, which are delivered by Council in conjunction with Celtronic, take place under Luke Jerram’s stunning Museum of the Moon installation, and last year packed crowds turned out to experience the hauntingly atmospheric performances.

week urges local householders reduce reuse recycle","story":"\nHouseholders across Derry were reminded this week of the need to ‘Reduce, reuse and recycle’ as Recycling Week got underway.\n\nThe Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, gave his backing to the campaign yesterday with the launch of a new furniture restoration course at Council’s New 2 You Re-use facility at Pennyburn Recycling Centre.\n\nLaunching the course, the Mayor said it would provide the opportunity for people to find out new ways of reusing old materials.\n\n“I am delighted to be here today to find out more about the services offered at the New 2 You centre,” he declared.\n\n“The skill and creativity of the staff in breathing new le into old and unwanted household items is extremely impressive and a great way of utilising old materials. It really makes you rethink how we treat our rubbish, and consider how it can become something useful with a bit of imagination and effort.\n\n“I would encourage people to come along to the centre and find out more about what we can all do to make small changes that can have a big impact on the environment.”\n\nRecycling Week will run from September 24-30, and this year’s theme ‘Recycling. We do. Because it matters’ is designed to convey simple but important messages about why recycling matters to everyone.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nCouncil’s Waste and Recycling Officer, Julie Hannaway, urged people to take on the challenge of becoming a recycling champion at school or at work.\n\n“Our campaign ‘Recycling. We do. Because it matters’ focuses on the very real impact that every inidual can make to our planet by thinking about rubbish. Simple measures like reducing the amount of packaged food you buy, using your food waste bin to recycle waste and recycling items from all around your home, including the bathroom, can make a real dference to our environment while saving your local Council money.\n\n“Being a recycling champion at work or in school by ensuring people have access to recycling bins can also reduce the amount of waste going to landfill and help our environment. Council can provide information on a number of ways people can help adapt their lestyle to become more environmentally aware.”\n\nPeople can also do their bit by donating any unwanted furniture or electrical items to the facility where they’ll be given a new lease of le by people training in trade skills.\n\nIf you would like to learn a new skill, revamp your home and help the local environment along the way then why not sign up for the furniture restoration course at New 2 You on 02871360453 or email \n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\n\nPictured above: The Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor John Boyle, pictured launching Recycling Week at Pennyburn Recycling Centre/New 2U with Joe Brolly, Centre Manager.

From the city of Porto onwards, you will see considerably more people but you\u0026rsquore walking along the coast which makes it really attractive.\n\nThe French Way, or Camino Franc\u0026eacutes, is the most popular route but the Camino del Norte along the north coast of Spain is a somewhat rougher trail of around 710kms. Edmund has done the French Way three time as well as the English Way.\n\nAs a social worker who manages hostels for homeless people in Belfast and beyond, Edmund sees his Camino walks as a way of taking time of his demanding work le.\n\n\u0026ldquoI get a chance to step out of the whole maelstrom of le and the pressure of work and everything else, said Edmund.\n\n\u0026ldquoEssentially it\u0026rsquos a pilgrimage but it\u0026rsquos also whatever you want to make of it.

There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees.

The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road.

They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running.

The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage.

Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C. Doyle, W.Y. Crichton, who was editor of the Down Recorder for 64 years, Brian Faulkner, the last Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, and mountaineer Dawson Stelfox, who climbed Mount Everest.\n\nOther speakers have included Senator David Norris with his one-man show on James Joyce, broadcaster Brian Black on his travels to Arctic regions and the late Arthur Pollock, verger of Down Cathedral, on his discovery of the Downpatrick Gold Find while digging a grave in 1954 and again in 1956.\n\nAnnual outing venues have included many interesting places such as the Armagh Planetarium, the Cathedrals of Armagh, Bishop Robinson\u0026rsquos library and stables, historic sites around Carlingford, walking tours of local towns and villages, The Somme Centre, The Boyne Valley Centre, boat trips and visits to private homes and castles. This year, the Society visited Collon House in County Louth.\n\nIn October 1960, a memorial to Sir Hans Sloane was unveiled in his Killyleagh birthplace.

The new body was named the Lecale \u0026amp Downe Historical Society, due to their shared aims, objectives and membership.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 2002, the Lecale Historical Society launched its website with the help of Mr Pat Devlin and encouragement from the late Dr James Hawthorne CBE, the society\u0026rsquos then president.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis provided an outlet for the Society to give details on the work that it does with the website containing a full index of articles and authors for the annual journal, copies of reports, annual programme and newsletters.\n\nThe website also includes some historical resources for the Lecale area, which include the 1901 census, Lewis\u0026rsquo Topographical Dictionary, Grfith\u0026rsquos Valuations of 1863, ships and shipwrecks associated with Lecale, the Nannie Cinnamon letters and ious others. The Society launched its own dedicated Facebook page at its annual meeting five years ago.\n\nThe society, which is one of the largest of its kind in Ulster with a membership of over 250, wishes to thank its many members and friends who have supported its work and volunteered over the past seven decades to ensure that the history and heritage of Lecale and surrounding parts of County Down are recorded for future generations.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nAnyone who would like to join the society for just \u0026pound10 and prevail of free entry to all society lectures and a complimentary copy of Lecale Review each year, should visit www.lecalehistory or email info@lecalehistory.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week.

We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

Zealand and France. Whisked egg whites and very little flour make them wonderfully light, and the ground almonds make them really moist. Traditionally they\u0026#8217re small cakes, but here I tip the batter into a baking dish and cook it whole,\" explains chef Yotam Ottolenghi.\n\n                \n\"You can make the batter well in advance here,  you want to get ahead – it keeps well in the fridge up to a day ahead – but don’t macerate the fruit for this amount of time as it will become too juicy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Serve with custard, vanilla ice cream or cream. The fruit can be played around with, depending on the season,\" he adds. \"Raspberries and peaches can be used in the early summer months, for example.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHOW TO MAKE YOTAM OTTOLENGHI’S PLUM, BLACKBERRY AND BAY\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFRIAND BAKE...\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Place the blackberries and plums in a bowl with the vanilla extract, sugar, bay leaves and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Set aside for 30 minutes. Don’t be tempted to leave them sitting around for longer than this, as the fruit will become too juicy.\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n3. Mix the flour, icing sugar, ground almonds, the remaininghalf a teaspoon cinnamon and salt in a separate large bowl. Set aside.\n\n4. Lightly whisk the egg whites by hand for 30 seconds, so they just start to froth. Stir into the flour mixture, along with the melted butter, until combined.\n\n5. Tip the batter into a 20 x 30cm parchment-lined baking dish and top evenly with the fruit and juices. Bake for 40 minutes, covering the dish with foil for the final 10 minutes, until the batter is golden-brown and the fruit is bubbling. Set aside for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nOttolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi with Tara Wigley and Esme Howarth, photography by Jonathan Lovekin, is published by Ebury Press, priced £25.

in his shed because he was getting headaches from the fumes given off by a portable oil heater he used in the building when the weather was cold.\n\n                \nBarrister Joseph Aiken asked him how often the shed would have been heated prior to being admitted to the RHI scheme.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Aiken said: “Call a spade a spade – a lot of people go into their garage or shed and there’s no heating in it per se they’re not there for a long time, they’re back out of it and they don’t go and get any heating to turn on...how often would you have been utilising heat in the shed?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone said he did so in the winter time, “probably a number of nights per week” and he used a portable heater to do so.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin asked him why he would change from using a portable heater for occasional use to installing a large permanent biomass boiler.\n\nThe former Spad said: “The fumes of the portable heater –  it was on any  of time and the door was closed you’d a headache I know I’ve a bigger headache now.”\n\nSir Patrick said: “You’d put up with those for seven years.”\u2028Mr Brimstone said: “I’d no alternative, chair”.\n\nSir Patrick said: “So you didn’t bother to get a non-fume-producing portable heater for seven years?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstoner said: “No. No, I didn’t.”\n\nDame Una O’Brien asked: “Did you have an electricity supply?”\n\nMr Brimstone said that he had and that he had used an electric heater  he was working at his workbench.\n\nSir Patrick said drily: “Not too many fumes from it, was there?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone said: “No, there was none.”\n\nLater, Mr Brimstone was asked whether  the RHI scheme had not been available he would have replaced his domestic biomass boiler with another biomass boiler.\n\nMr Brimstone said: “No.”\n\nLater, Mr Aiken asked him: “Did it not seem rather contrived to you? You’ve been using biomass to heat your house. You’ve got...limited transient heat need in your shed...and you used heating in it occasionally...but you end up with a scenario where even though you’ve a more limited heat need in your shed and a full heat need for your house you can get on the non-domestic scheme through the shed and as a result have the greater benefit for your house...did it not seem odd to you that you could do it [within the rules]?”\n\nMr Brimstone said he had not thought it was strange because he had come across the scheme through his work as a Spad and suggestions of the Housing Executive using it for communal heat needs between multiple properties. He said that it seemed clear to him that  there were two houses beside each other “that both of those properties could be heated through the non-domestic scheme for totally domestic purposes, in essence”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTherefore, he said, “it didn’t seem odd from where I came at the scheme”.\n\nMr Brimstone stressed that it “never crossed my mind” to run his boiler more than was necessary or leave doors open.\n\nMr Aiken said: “In fairness to you, what I’m making clear, from the material the inquiry has received, is that as a fact that clearly wasn’t what you were doing.\n\n“In fairness to you, I’m making that clear because the usage figures that have been provided indicate that your boiler was running for about four to four and a half hours per day [on average across the course of a year] – that’s rather dferent from 24 hours per day”.\n            \n    \n    try

understanding of some of the key flaws in the RHI scheme and was making suggestions which would not have addressed some of those flaws \u0026#8211 yet Mrs Foster said he never told her of the issues.\n\n                \nThe DUP leader faced question after question about how her closest aide Andrew Crawford – who was a hand-picked DUP member given a publicly funded salary of about £85,000 a year – had been in repeated contact with another DUP special advisor, Tim Cairns, who says that the contact served to delay cost controls.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nAndrew Crawford was Arlene Foster\u0027s closest advisor for most of her ministerial career\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDr Crawford has denied that allegation.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEmails which the inquiry has obtained under its sweeping powers of compulsion show that from at least summer 2015 Dr Crawford was aware of how easily the scheme could be abused and was fully expecting a huge spike in applications from poultry farmers.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nMrs Foster said that Crawford never told her “at any time” that there was a perverse incentive at the heart of the scheme whereby it paid poultry farmers to heat their poultry houses when they were empty.\n\nShe said that Dr Crawford should have told her about the abuse of the scheme and also “probably” about his understanding that there would be a “huge spike” in applications to the scheme because word had spread throughout the industry.\n\nInquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin said: “This is why one would get so concerned about your selection of Spad. It looks as though, throughout the summer, your Spad – who was the Spad for the minister responsible for DFP, which in my limited understanding is the department in charge of public money – he’s having a series of exchanges that involve, for example, waste heat which is taking up public money, he’s making a suggestion that you should have 3,000 hours [for boilers to get the most lucrative tarf] rather than 1,314 in the interests of Moy Park, he suggests setting up a meeting with Moy Park ... all of this is done by an unelected Spad and about which you as the minister have no knowledge.”\n\nMrs Foster replied: “Yes, but I think in terms of the Moy Park issue, it’s my understanding that he was saying ‘there seems to be a problem because they’re able to run it for a lot higher than they need, and  you reduce it down then that will deal with the issue of fraud. Am I right on that?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nSir Patrick asked why her Spad had not come back to her and said “this has an impact on public expenditure”.\n\nMrs Foster said: “Well, I think  Andrew was here he would – and this is not an excuse, and I don’t want it taken as an excuse – but he would say that he thought he was dealing with Annual Managed Expenditure [meaning it was paid for by the Treasury, not Stormont], instead of it coming out of the block grant.\n\n“That’s not an excuse, but I think that’s something he would say.”\n\nSir Patrick said: “Even  he was, he’s also talking about abuse.” Mrs Foster said: “But I think that’s why he’s making a suggestion to deal with that in terms of policy.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nSir Patrick replied: “All I’m saying is that here we have an unelected Spad who doesn’t go back to the minister but who assumes the mantle of negotiator with another Spad. And the first thing you know about it is what? In December or later?” Mrs Foster said she first realised in December.\n\nAt that point the inquiry’s technical assessor interjected to highlight that contrary to what Mrs Foster had said – that Dr Crawford had made a proposal to deal with abuse of the scheme – that actually Dr Crawford’s proposal was to maintain the generosity of the scheme, to the benefit of Moy Park users, something which would have largely neutered the cost controls.\n\nReferring to Moy Park’s suppliers, Sir Patrick interjected to say: “Who were being subsidised, we now know, by the tarfs.”\n\nDr MacLean highlighted that  the poultry industry was to continue to get the same RHI money even after cost controls, then “it will make no dference whatsoever to the overspend”.\n\nMrs Foster said: “Yes, I understand.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDr MacLean said that the evidence raised the question “what on earth was your Spad doing in this involvement without your knowledge?”\n\nMrs Foster said: “I accept that.”\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n

country singer \"Big Tom\" McBride has praised a new statue of him as a \"fitting tribute\".\n\n                \nIrish President Michael D Higgins unveiled the monument to Big Tom in Castleblayney on Sunday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe praised it as \"a wonderful testament to the popularity of Big Tom\".\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"That love for Big Tom, his music and the man he was is something that you know best but of course share, not only with people across our island of Ireland, not only in Irish communities across the world, but with many other peoples from dferent cultures,\" he said.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nBig Tom, who was a huge star in the 60s and 70s, died in April aged 81, as the statue and festival in his honour were in the process of being planned.\n\nThe entertainer\u0027s son, Thomas, described the unveiling of the bronze statue of his father as a celebratory moment, tinged with sadness.\n\nThe Co Monaghan town centre was packed on Sunday with over a thousand fans travelling from across Ireland and further afield.\n\nThere were cheers as Mr Higgins unveiled the statue, before a rush of fans eager to see it up close and get their photo taken with it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThomas told those assembled that his family were devastated his mother Rose, who also died earlier this year, as well as his father were not there to see it.\n\n\"The main focus of my few words is to give thanks, and we have many people to thank for making this day possible,\" he said.\n\n\"This day is a very proud day for the McBride family, celebratory yet tinted with sadness, for they have departed, Mum and Dad.\n\n\"We are devastated that Mum and Dad aren\u0027t here today, I know they would have loved it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Thank you all.\"\n\nBig Tom and the Mainliners were formed in the 1960s and achieved widespread success.\n\nHenry McMahon, another member of the Mainliners, also described it as a day tinged with sadness.\n\n\"It\u0027s a wonderful day, tinged with sadness, but it\u0027s no less than Big Tom deserves, he was an icon, and still is an icon,\" he told the Press Association.\n\nUK-based sculptor Mark Richards said he had never seen a crowd like it, in the unveiling of all the pieces he has worked on.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained initially he had considered a sculpture of Big Tom on stage performing, but later decided on the sitting pose without the microphone in front of him, like a \"barrier\" between him and his fans.\n\nThat option was chosen by the family who felt it best reflected Tom\u0027s approachability and \"man of the people\" persona.\n\nAmong the fans in attendance were Richard and Marian Phillips from Co Kildare.\n\n\"I have been following Big Tom since 1971, he had a lovely manner, very natural, very down to earth, everyone was his friend,\" said Mr Phillips, who was wearing a Big Tom T-shirt.\n\nMyles Kavanagh had travelled from Kilkenny and dressed as Elvis for the occasion.\n\n\"It\u0027s magnicent, Big Tom would be proud of us all, Big Tom was the king of country, I may be the king of rock\u0027n\u0027roll but he was the king of country, we\u0027ll always have Big Tom in our memories,\" he said.\n\n\"He was so kind, he brought so much happiness to people with his music and he was a gentleman on and off the stage.\"\n\nThe unveiling came during the inaugural Castleblayney Celebrates Big Tom Festival, which opened on Culture Night and continued across the weekend.\n\nMcBride\u0027s career spanned more than five decades, culminating in his induction into the Irish Country Music Awards Hall of Fame in June 2016.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n                      \n\n    \n\n
