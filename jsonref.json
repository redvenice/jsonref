Burger King and KFC reopened a handful of restaurants for delivery only this week.Deliveroo and its financial advisers told the CMA the business would fail financially and exit the market unless Amazon went ahead with its investment. But on Friday, the CMA said it had been considering new evidence about financial difficulties at Deliveroo “as a matter of urgency” and had “provisionally concluded that Deliveroo’s exit from the market would be inevitable without access to significant additional funding, which the CMA considers that only Amazon would be willing and able to provide at this time.”Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMA’s independent inquiry group, said: “These wholly unprecedented circumstances have meant reassessing the focus of this investigation, reacting quickly to the impact of the coronavirus and deciding what it would mean for the businesses involved in this transaction and, in turn, for customers.“Without additional investment, which we currently think is only realistically available from Amazon, it’s clear that Deliveroo would not be able to meet its financial commitments and would have to exit the market. This could mean that some customers are cut off from online food delivery altogether, with others facing higher prices or a reduction in service quality. Faced with that stark outcome, we feel the best course of action is to provisionally clear Amazon’s investment in Deliveroo.”Deliveroo secured the investment from Amazon last May when it raised £450m of new investment. How much of that investment was from Amazon was never disclosed, but it is understood it was the biggest investor in that funding round. The cash injection was paused during the CMA’s investigation and cannot be handed over until the watchdog makes its final judgment, which may take another two months.The watchdog has asked for views on its provisional findings by 11 May and will make its final decision before 11 June.Deliveroo said: “The unprecedented health crisis we all face has disrupted businesses across the country. This investment will help us to overcome immediate and long-term challenges, allow us to continue to improve our service for customers, enable us to develop new innovations and offer people even greater choice.”Deliveroo wanted investment to boost its performance against other deep-pocketed rivals such as Uber Eats, owned by the taxi app company Uber, and Just Eat, the FTSE 100 delivery platform which was recently bought out by European rival rival Takeaway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8afe603694c3c9e7d47cda998bce2346c97168d5/0_360_5398_3239/master/5398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20bbea68526c4d2ecf1e5bcfa0c362cc","title":"at least seven debenhams stores close loss 400 jobs","story":"Department store chain to close outlets in Salisbury, Westfield in west London and elsewhereAt least seven Debenhams department stores will not reopen after the high street lockdown eases, resulting in the loss of more than 400 jobs.The department store, which collapsed into administration last week, is understood to be exiting the seven stores, including in Salisbury, Westfield in west London, Leamington Spa, and South Shields, as it has been unable to reach agreement with landlords.Deals have been struck regarding 120 of the chain’s 142 sites, which leaves the future of a further 15 outlets hanging in the balance.All Debenhams’ stores closed temporarily on 23 March along with most of the rest of the high street after the government ordered a lockdown on non-essential retail in order to control the spread of coronavirus.The shutdown has prompted fears that thousands of stores will never reopen as many already weak retail firms – which had been suffering from rising costs, the switch to online shopping and weak consumer confidence – struggle to cope with the loss of high street trade.Major names including Oasis, Warehouse and Laura Ashley have already called in administrators and other chains are expected to follow suit.Debenhams, which has fallen into administration for the second time in a year, had already closed 22 stores as part of an attempt to rescue the business by its new owners, who are led by the US hedge funds Silver Point and GoldenTree. A further 28 were expected to close next year but it is clear those plans have been accelerated.Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the chief executive of Debenhams, who is continuing to run the business in administration, said: “We have agreed terms on the vast majority of our UK stores and talks are proceeding positively on the remainder, positioning us to reopen these stores when government regulations permit.“Regrettably we have been unable to reach agreement on seven stores and these will not be reopening, and I’d like to express my thanks to our colleagues in these stores at what I know is a difficult time for everyone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/385178f2e5c6a15ee244fb5e4fb192dcf47709af/15_151_5107_3064/master/5107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc389d5090c2935ea4a7dad9d0f4cc75","title":"bank of england tells lenders to get on with covid 19 business loans","story":"Governor Andrew Bailey says ‘livelihoods are at stake’ as figures show only £1.1bn lent to small firmsThe Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has told Britain’s high street lenders that they must “put their backs into” providing loans for companies affected by Covid-19 amid evidence that many will fail without urgent help.Bailey said commercial banks were under no illusion that “they had to get on with this” to prevent long-term scarring of the economy as a result of the pandemic.Speaking at a virtual press conference, Bailey said banks were operating under difficult conditions but added: “Notwithstanding the stress they are under, they have got to put their backs into it and get on with this. They have to get on and process this stuff because livelihoods are at stake.”“The chancellor needs to make that decision because the public purse is at risk,” Bailey said.Figures from the US suggest that American banks have been much quicker than those in the UK to provide loans to small companies to help them through the lockdown. Bailey said he was not acquainted with the US system, but said: “This is an issue that has to be tackled.”The Bank is currently working on its forecasts for the economy ahead of the publication of its next quarterly monetary policy report in early May – the first since the spread of Covid-19 to the UK closed down large parts of the economy.The governor was cautious, however, about the OBR’s assumption that activity would return to its pre-Covid-19 levels by the end of the year. Bailey said that would depend on the level of business failures and whether the government’s furlough scheme led to much higher unemployment.The International Monetary Fund said earlier this week that global financial stability could be put at risk by the deepest recession since the 1930s, but Bailey said the UK’s financial system was robust enough to withstand the pressure. The Bank’s stress tests had not factored in Sunak’s decision to support the economy through higher public spending, wage subsidies and loan guarantees.Bailey said the government was having no trouble raising the money from the financial markets to cover its sharply increased borrowing, adding that Sunak had yet to draw on a government overdraft facility at the Bank of England, which was announced last week.But he made clear that the Bank was keeping a close eye on the long-term implications of the additional debt being accumulated by the government, businesses and households. “We have to watch that very carefully,” Bailey said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f47e0c1fe593617e18d14a33d0b1a319e8e6aad7/0_157_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=247856ced2d26f38da3a8ef5e495f0f7","title":"ey ordered pay whistleblower 11m dubai gold audit case","story":"Court rules accountancy firm breached code of ethics in its dealings with a refinerA former partner at the accounting firm EY has been awarded $10.8m (£8.6m) in damages after being forced out of his job when he exposed professional misconduct during an audit of a Dubai gold refiner.The high court in London ruled on Friday that EY had repeatedly breached the code of ethics for professional accountants in its dealings with one of its clients, Kaloti Jewellery International.The claim was brought by Amjad Rihan, who revealed that silver-coated gold had been shipped from Morocco to avoid export restrictions and precious metal obtained from other countries such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iran without due diligence.After telling EY about his concerns, Rihan was ordered back to Dubai but feared for his and his family’s safety. He resigned and subsequently made whistleblowing disclosures in 2014.Mr Justice Kerr found EY had breached its duty to Rihan through failing to perform the Kaloti audit in an ethical and professional manner.The court awarded Rihan a total of $10,843,941 and £117,950 in sterling for damages for past and future loss of earnings, and loss of employment benefits.After the ruling, Rihan said: “Almost seven years of agony for me and my family has come to an end with a total vindication by the court. My life was turned upside down as I was cruelly and harshly punished for insisting on doing my job ethically, professionally and lawfully in relation to the gold audits in Dubai.“The court ruled in my favour and found that EY breached its duties towards me, for which I am very grateful. I hope that EY uses this judgment as an opportunity to improve and take the necessary measures to avoid anything like this ever happening again.”Paul Dowling, a solicitor from law firm Leigh Day who represented Rihan, said: “For years EY has refused to admit any wrongdoing in relation to the Kaloti audit. Instead it accused Mr Rihan of being a liar and a fantasist. Our client’s character and actions have now been completely vindicated by the court.“By contrast it is EY which has been found to have committed serious professional misconduct at the highest echelons of the organisation. This important judgment sends a clear message to would-be whistleblowers that they do not have to tolerate unethical conduct within their organisation, no matter how high up the chain it goes.In his judgment, Kerr said: “Gold is used in the banking industry, for investment purposes in the jewellery industry and in the electronics industry, for manufacturing. It is recognised internationally as being among the ‘conflict minerals’ attractive to criminals and terrorists because it is relatively easy to move and holds its value well.“For these reasons, the importance of good due diligence and regulation in the gold refining industry and other ‘conflict minerals’ trading is emphasised in guidance published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and in US legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Act. The claimant and his colleagues at EY Dubai and EY MENA saw this as an opportunity to acquire fruitful work producing assurance reporting to gold refiners in Dubai and elsewhere in the region. Kaloti was the most substantial of the Dubai refiners, with the largest market share.”Commenting on the Morocco transactions, Kerr said: “I accept as a fact that the defendants were responsible for suggesting to Kaloti that it should draft its compliance report in a manner that masked the reality of the Morocco gold issue, removing the reference to Morocco and changing the coating of gold bars with silver to documentary irregularities. I regard this as professional misconduct.”An EY spokesperson said: “We are surprised and disappointed by the judge’s decision, its introduction of an unprecedented legal duty and its financial award to a former EY Dubai partner. We will appeal and, therefore, not comment in detail. It was the work of an EY Dubai assurance team that uncovered serious irregularities and reported them to the proper authorities. Their work ultimately resulted in sanctions against the refiner and contributed to significant changes in the sourcing of precious metals and the regulation of refiners in Dubai.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74cebb15d749afec57f96b61807fd12a7cc7f008/0_163_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b92fbc899fed274f3cce184be8dc472","title":"suppliers ration stocks tinned tomatoes after surge demand","story":"Supermarkets and convenience store groups are understood to be jockeying for supplies as families continue to buy more tinned foods than usual after the closure of schools and restaurants forced them to cook more meals at home.While all tinned food sales have surged, suppliers and retailers said demand for tomatoes had outstripped that for beans, soup and tinned fish or vegetables, leaving suppliers concerned about stocks running low.David McDiarmid, a director of Princes Group, which owns the Napolina brand, confirmed it was allocating stock to its clients to ensure it could “fairly and equitably share” what is available and prevent stocks running out before the new season begins in June.Italian tomatoes make up about three-quarters of UK stocks, according to the Grocer trade journal, and are canned between June and September.Diego Pariotti, the head of export at Conserve Italia, which owns the Cirio tinned tomato brand, said it could meet usual order levels but not “crazy demand”. He added they had told customers: “If you don’t start calming the fever we won’t get to the next crop.”People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.McDiarmid said: “It’s a seasonal crop. It’s finite. What was picked last year is what was picked and that’s all there is until 2020 harvest. We can’t bring forward the harvest.” He said Napolina’s processing plant in Puglia, Italy, had sent out 72 full trucks on one day alone last month, about four times the normal level, as it tried to keep up with demand from stockpiling families.While demand has since slowed, McDiarmid said staff in Italy had been doing a “Herculean job” trying to meet demand under strict physical distancing rules.Transporting product to the UK has also been more difficult and expensive as suppliers have had to combine sea, rail and road transport to meet demand and deal with hold-ups at border crossings and difficulties in keeping drivers safe.Supermarkets said they were confident supplies would not run out because they were turning to alternative brands and own-label products. But they confirmed there was competition over access to product between different chains.As prices are usually set in June for the year ahead, the price of tomatoes has not gone up but suppliers’ profit margins have been squeezed by additional costs and it is likely that prices will rise for the year ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16d0a4579e9df28986d8a49e4b7c0084222ce4f/0_84_3559_2135/master/3559.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3c78f9930cc914c3b8eb23f00e53b63d","title":"have you been affected coronavirus anywhere but westminster","story":"For our next episode of Anywhere but Westminster we would like to hear from you As the ’s Anywhere but Westminster video series continues about life in the coronavirus crisis, we want to hear from people directly affected by the illness itself.Do you have the virus right now, and are you enduring self-isolation?

It needs disruptingAt Amazon, it’s always “day one”. Founder Jeff Bezos coined the phrase in the company’s early days, and it’s now deeply woven into the firm’s culture: it has appeared in every shareholder letter since 1997, and even adorns the building in which Bezos works. As tech reporter Alex Kantrowitz writes, “day one” means “inventing like a startup” – a call for continual improvement and innovation. Dynamism is in complacency is out. For Bezos, “day two” is another name for death.However, it’s not always wise to take corporate self-description at face value. Still, given the staggering speed and scale of Amazon’s growth, it’s reasonable to think that its “day one” mentality has had something to do with its success. Since it was founded in 1994, Amazon has become one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalisation of just over $1tn at time of writing.But despite the outward success, Amazon’s embrace of ceaseless invention has come at a cost. In the absence of a strong ethical code, the ruthlessness that makes Amazon so successful for its shareholders can become indistinguishable from cruelty toward those who are not counted in its success metrics. Amazon itself may be flourishing during the coronavirus pandemic, but not all Amazonians are benefiting equally.As customers turn to delivery services such as Amazon out of fear of contracting the virus, the risks appear to have merely been shifted on to workers. A warehouse worker in New York state organised a walkout last month to protest what he alleged were the company’s inadequate safety measures, including its lack of paid sick leave, and was fired a leaked memo indicated that Amazon’s general counsel wanted to depict him as “not smart or articulate” in their PR strategy (the executive who made this remark later published a statement that read “I let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me”).Amazon’s poor treatment of its frontline workers – both during this crisis and beforehand – illustrates the dark side of the “day one” mentality. Amazon’s constant push to improve productivity may serve shareholders, but it also results in working conditions so physically taxing that warehouses are stocking vending machines with pain medication, in a tacit acknowledgement of the physical toll. For Amazon, collateral damage appears irrelevant as long as there’s a steady flow of workers walking through the doors every morning.That Amazon is evidently not accountable to its workers should raise the question of who Amazon is accountable to. The more Bezos’s empire embeds itself into the infrastructure of our lives, the more important it becomes to question its motives. In the midst of a crisis with an easily identifiable villain – the virus – Amazon has an opportunity to recast itself as corporate saviour for our times, the company that kept everyone stocked with necessary supplies, even when they couldn’t leave their houses. As other services have slowed or ground to a halt, Prime deliveries are one of the few continuities from the world we’re leaving behind. But make no mistake – Amazon is not merely a benevolent or charitable force, akin to the Red Cross. It is, after all, a commercial company, and its ownership structure is absurdly out of sync with the map of who’s affected by it.As this pandemic makes the world more dependent on Amazon, it’s useful to remember who is actually doing the day-to-day work that keeps the company running. It’s not Jeff Bezos making the deliveries or packing the boxes, after all. For that, we should thank the frontline workers, who are underpaid, overworked and often putting themselves at risk.The coronavirus crisis has essentially functioned as a stress test of our entire socioeconomic order, inadvertently shining a harsh light on all the ways people are being failed by this system. The result could be massive upheaval. In the US, unemployment rates are higher than they’ve been in eight decades millions of renters are skipping their rent payments policies that would have been considered anathema before the crisis are being seriously debated. The structure can be changed – indeed, once we emerge from this crisis, we may find that it will have already changed. Our political imaginations will need to be updated to reflect this new reality.The more Amazon effectively functions as a utility, the more we should be thinking about how to treat it that way. There are many avenues that could be explored: stronger anti-trust legislation something akin to nationalisation breaking it up into separate companies stronger labour protections increased worker control. Rather than an Amazon that sacrifices workers on the altar of shareholder value, we could have an Amazon that balances the needs of all relevant stakeholders.These suggestions might sound impossibly radical, not least because those currently in charge are unlikely to support measures to decrease their wealth and power. But maybe we can borrow a page from Amazon’s book to frame this discussion in a new way. After all, there’s something quite appealing in the idea of “day one”, with its connotations of disruption and reinvention. It’s just a pity that Amazon has directed that energy exclusively towards maximising shareholder value.Imagine instead, if that “day one” spirit were directed toward the socioeconomic system that subordinated these workers in the first place, such that the fruits of their labour were shared more equitably. Day two might not be that terrifying after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7d340a43e02898ced9e10af6b68016f0ee31ef5/0_20_7360_4415/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3112fc86cb5e96b50fa8ede3df856ea9","title":"lockdown women working mothers coronavirus home working","story":"The economics of coronavirus and the logistics of home-working are playing into some old gender inequalitiesFlicking through our slowly emptying family calendar, a relic of a more innocent age jumps out.“Back to school”, it says in thick black pen, across the beginning of next week. Well, dream on. Across Europe schools are now tentatively beginning to reopen, at least in countries such as Denmark which locked down earlier than we did German schools too are likely to start returning from early May. But in Britain, it might be half term before that can be considered.Nobody wants schools and nurseries to reopen until everyone is sure it’s safe, obviously. Children seem for the most part only mildly affected by the virus but not immune, and teachers continue to be vulnerable parental physical distancing amidst the general muddle of drop-off and pickup would be a struggle, and once the kids are mingling freely some adults will want to do the same. Yet knowing that there’s no alternative doesn’t make it any easier to earn a living while you’re trying to teach the bus stop method for long ision.For not everyone is charmed by small persons barging gleefully into video calls, and the prejudices some employers have always harboured against working parents haven’t magically disappeared overnight. The charity Working Families reports a spike in demand for its free legal services it’s hearing from women told that if they can’t manage working around their children they should just take unpaid leave, and from pregnant women sacked if they won’t work in risky public-facing roles. The tragic death of a heavily pregnant nurse, Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, is a chilling reminder of the anxieties facing many expectant key workers, although we still cannot know whether she was infected at work or not.Parents worry at the best of times about competing with childfree colleagues who can put in as many hours as it takes, but strip away our childcare and we feel more exposed than ever. This epidemic has been a giant leap back to the dark days before organised childcare families can muddle through for a bit, but in the longer term home-working with kids underfoot is the 21st-century equivalent of Victorian urchins playing under their mothers’ looms in textile mills.Single parents, the vast majority of them women, are as ever at the sharp end of this, and lone parent charity Gingerbread warns that many feel increasingly “alone and overwhelmed”. But dual career couples have their challenges too.Whichever partner chose a job in normal times that seemed flexible around the family is more likely to be slumped over a laptop at 2am now, the classic price paid for stealing time with the kids in the afternoon. And if one of you has to crack and request a furlough, it makes more sense for that to be the lower earner.It’s men who are the most obvious victims of this epidemic, being twice as likely as women to die of coronavirus. Seven in 10 of those ending up in intensive care with Covid-19 are also male, something only partly explained by risk factors like more men smoking. On the economic side, the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds job losses so far have disproportionately hit women, as well as young and low-paid people. That’s no surprise given who tends to work in the pubs, restaurants and shops most directly hit by lockdown, and things may change as other industries start being affected by slumping consumer demand. But the lesson from the aftermath of the banking crash is that ministers were too slow to realise austerity was affecting women differently from men there’s no excuse for making the same mistake this time.Now that four in 10 companies still trading are seeking to reduce staffing levels and over a quarter are cutting hours, ministers should be auditing what’s happening on the ground and using the pulpit of those daily press conferences to warn employers that discrimination law still applies in a crisis.There’s a reason it’s illegal to target women on maternity leave when making redundancies, and it’s that too many bosses try it on at the best of times. Don’t let the worst of times become an excuse for turning back the clock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3397d35dac6f8f47ada20b3bc47578c137e86f9e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83f4aef495da43ef6f7951b7a072f0e1","title":"political imagination end lockdown mass testing contact tracing","story":"The methods – whether it’s mass testing or contact-tracing – matter less than the huge shift in thinking that is requiredSometimes you’re just asking the wrong question. On news programmes and at daily briefings, politicians across the world face versions of the same query again and again: when will the lockdown end? But that’s the wrong question.Imagine a family has escaped a rampaging bear in the woods, seeking refuge in a log cabin. After sheltering there for days and weeks, they’re desperate to know when they can come out. But they wouldn’t simply be asking “When?” They would be asking “When will it be safe?” which is a different and tougher question, one whose answer would depend on several other questions: has the bear been tamed? If it hasn’t, do we have the weapons to destroy it or at least protect ourselves against it? And are those protections strong enough that we won’t have to rush back inside the cabin the moment we’ve ventured out?We should be clear on one thing. Impatience to see an end to this mass, global quarantine is understandable. It’s not just boredom or lack of stamina that prompts it. There are people struggling to put food on the table there are people whose mental health is faltering there are people for whom a day stuck at home is a day stuck with a domestic abuser. For them lockdown is a jail sentence and they need it to end. So of course it makes sense to long for an exit strategy. But it has to begin with an understanding of what lockdown is and what it is not. It’s tempting to see it as a solution: everyone stays at home, we “flatten the curve” and then, slowly and gradually, we lift the restrictions and return to normal. But that’s not how it is. Instead, lockdown is merely the crudest, bluntest instrument we could reach for when the coronavirus first struck. Its primary objective was to keep the number of people infected sufficiently low that the health service could cope. Judged by that standard, preventing, say, the NHS in Britain being overwhelmed, it has succeeded.Read the expert plans, and they all come back to one thing. Sure, social distancing will have to endure, in one form or other, but the key will be the one identified by the World Health Organization at the start: testing, testing, testing.And yet here, too, there is a misconception, and it is one of scale. So far, testing has been limited to those with symptoms and in hospital. But the Nobel laureate Paul Romer – admittedly his prize was for economics rather than epidemiology – has got a lot of attention for a plan that argues that for the economy, and human life, to return to anything like normality, testing will need to be conducted for millions of people, all the time. He imagines health workers being tested at the start of a shift the same would go for care workers, pharmacists, police officers and bus drivers. You might add teachers and restaurant workers. Romer wouldn’t bother testing people who already have symptoms: they should be presumed positive and immediately self-isolate. It’s the “asymptomatic spreaders” you need to identify, stopping them in their tracks. The logic underpinning the plan is clear: there will be no point in reopening shops, pubs and restaurants if people feel too scared to visit them. As virologist Prof Nicolas Locker puts it, “You can’t lift the lockdown as long as you are not testing massively.”Do the maths and the numbers are colossal: Romer estimates some 22m tests would be necessary every day in the US alone, the equivalent of testing every American once every two weeks. Consider that there’s still no sign that Matt Hancock will reach his goal of 100,000 tests a day in the UK, and you realise how many orders of magnitude stand between where we are now and where we would need to be. The obstacles are huge and obvious, though Romer reckons he has answers for all of them. Shortage of swabs? Move to saliva tests instead. Shortage of the key chemicals known as “reagents”? The test kits that rely on them are not the only option. The sheer numbers of tests that would have to be produced? The world’s manufacturers could do it it just requires the political will. Which, given that our lives depend on it, should be there.If that seems daunting, there is another approach. It would still require testing – though not on the same scale – followed by contact tracing: finding all those who’d been in close proximity to someone who’d tested positive and isolating them. “Test, trace, isolate” also has logic on its side, but it, too, takes lots of money and people. It’s thought one contact-tracer is  required for every four cases of infection.That means using the hiatus of lockdown to recruit and train people now in the mechanics of contact tracing. With no leadership from the top – on Thursday Donald Trump effectively announced that the buck stops with the 50 states – the likes of Massachusetts are already assembling their own squads of contact-tracers. San Francisco is doing the same, deploying a combination of librarians and medical students. The UK government could follow their lead immediately, putting to work some of the thousands of people currently at home and itching to help. Tech can play a role, too: note this week’s announcement that Apple and Google will join forces to see if they can produce the app that will make tracing easier and faster, though the threat to privacy of such surveillance is obvious.What specific methods are deployed matter less than the bigger shift that is required, which is one of imagination. Governments need to realise that what’s coming is not a decision about easing this or that rule of social distancing, but rather a massive political, industrial and collective drive unseen since the last war. It may well mean repurposing factories to mass-produce testing kits. At the very least, it should mean a dedicated cabinet minister for testing.This demands a huge shift by the UK government, which wasn’t even testing people coming out of hospital and going into social care until this week. But nothing less will be enough. It’s not enough to flatten the curve we have to get ahead of it. It’s true that we cannot stay in lockdown for ever. But we cannot leave until it’s safe – and that requires a monumental effort, starting right now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d56b26c3398df6e027080d1ea4e05fbfec0ceed8/619_697_2893_1734/master/2893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6529cf2154b76136e642be3120bb89e3","title":"suzi ruffell funniest things","story":"The comedian, actor and writer on the things that make her laugh the mostWanda Sykes.

To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.“Some are saying they cannot commit to 40 hours a week, some can only commit for a few weeks whereas some roles can be full time for eight weeks and some can be up to six months,” said Sarah Boparan, the operations director at Hops.She said that even though they were not able to hire all who applied, she felt there was an education process under way about farm work that could have a lasting impact after Brexit, when Conservative party plans will put a block on low-paid and low-skilled workers coming to the UK from abroad.“We are so pleased to see so many people apply and so thankful they have responded to the call to support agriculture in this country and we appreciate their patience as some of the crops are not yet ready and new offers will be going out,” she said, adding that peak recruitment would not really start till the end of May for most farms.Several people who said they had responded to the government-backed appeal complained about the barriers to taking up the posts, particularly the on-site accommodation.One man who contacted the , who lives in Norfolk and wanted to commute to a job locally, where there are many farms, said: “Some of the jobs require you to live on-site. It doesn’t make it easy at all. If we really need to be picking all these vegetables, they don’t make it very easy. I can’t move I have a family.”Gary Leshone, 35, who used to work in fishing in Grimsby, launched his own personal recruitment drive when the national Feed the Nation appeal, backed by the environment secretary, George Eustice, was launched three weeks ago.He managed to get 150 volunteers who were willing to cross the country to Herefordshire and to live on-site for six months.“I contacted farmers inidually and initially I was told by one farmer he’d take as many workers as he could get, so I went on radio and social media and got 150 people. I know I could probably find 1,000 to 2,000 here because people are out of work.”He was then told by the farmer that he needed a gangmaster’s licence if he was going to place that many workers on the market, which he was told would take 10 weeks to obtain.“By that time the fruit and veg will have rotted and the borders will probably be reopened,” he said.Underlining the confused messaging surrounding the sudden recruitment drive, Hops pointed out that the Gangmaster and Labour Abuse Authority was doing checks and handing out gangmaster licences within five days because of the crisis.“The Romanians coming in are just like us, looking for work to feed their families themselves, but if they need 90,000 people and you have all these British people unemployed and the government has to pay out universal credit, it’s just ridiculous. The government should do more to sort this out,” said Leshone.Recruiters appealed for patience among British hopefuls, pointing out that the peak season started from May and there would be “thousands of roles available for people who are in need of a job”.There was controversy in Romania after photographs emerged of crowds gathering in regional airports for flights to Germany, which, like the UK, is also suffering a labour deficit. Questions are being asked in Romania as to how workers could leave to help ease other countries’ demand for fresh food when much of Romania is in strict lockdown.G’s Fresh, one of the UK’s biggest salad growers, which has chartered two of the six planes from Bucharest, said it had recruited 500 British workers so far.“We’re really pleased with how the recruitment campaign is going, but it is important that we have got these people from Romania. These are key skilled workers who were with us last year. We need experienced people who can make sure everyone is safe and knows what to do,” Beverley Dixon, the company’s HR director, told Eastern Daily Press.Romanian workers travelling to the UK were given masks and sanitiser before boarding and would be be quarantined in small teams before full deployment, G’s Fresh said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b44094542883af78d1ab326a0cd18544f8711bf7/0_101_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e790f2bfd93e1fae59b8a79741da1347","title":"falconers to be allowed to take wild peregrine chicks from nests","story":"UK wildlife watchdog under fire as conservationists say decision ‘sends wrong message’Conservationists have condemned the decision to allow falconers to take wild peregrine falcon chicks from nests as “selfish” and “sending the wrong message”.For the first time ever this year, Natural England, the government’s wildlife watchdog, will allow the taking of six chicks from peregrine nests to help falconers establish a lucrative new “studbook” of British falcons.Peregrine falcons – the fastest species on the planet, reaching more than 200mph during es for prey – were threatened with extinction as a breeding bird in the 1970s. Numbers have recovered to 826 breeding pairs in England, with many nesting on cathedrals and tall buildings in cities, where they are free from persecution.The RSPB said it was “urgently” seeking answers from Natural England about how it made its decision and feared the licence could “open the door” to more applications.Mark Thomas, the RSPB’s head of investigations, said: “The cultural value of these birds is that they are free, wild and available to all. The application will therefore be regarded by many as selfish – it should be reconsidered in light of alternative solutions, and in the context that peregrines suffer from illegal persecution, trade and loss of breeding range.”While all nesting birds are legally protected, licensing the removal of chicks for falconry is permitted under wildlife laws. Falconers argue that their current captive birds are not verifiably British birds and EU regulations permit the sustainable use of species for cultural purposes.Unesco recognises falconry as an “intangible cultural heritage of humanity” and the ancient practice is increasingly lucrative, with birds changing hands for as much as £6,000 to supply the sport of falcon-racing in the Middle East. Three falconers will remove chicks from nests in England, although they will not be allowed to do so in parts of northern England where the peregrine is still threatened.Natural England said its licence would only allow a chick to be taken from a nest where there were three or more chicks present. The falconers must only take the smallest, weakest chick, which would not ordinarily survive in the wild. It said it would be “closely monitoring the operation” and could revoke the two-year licence at any time.One falconer behind the attempt to establish a captive population of indisputably British birds, Gary Wing, told Mark Avery’s blog that there was “no commercial interest” in the scheme, which would be costly for falconers to establish.Until the introduction of DNA testing of captive birds in the 1990s, peregrines were regularly and illegally taken from the wild.David Lindo, a conservationist known as “the urban birder”, said he was dismayed at the decision.“It sends the wrong message,” he said. “We’ve got enough birds in captivity. If you’re going to be doing falconry, use the birds in captivity. What is wrong with them? Someone is making money from this somewhere along the line – what sort of message does this send around Europe and the Middle East? It validates the idea that the peregrine is not a species in decline and we can take some more from the wild.”Jade Emery, wildlife campaigner for Animal Aid, said it was “a huge step backwards” for wild bird protection.She said: “While Natural England attempt to dignify falconry by describing it as ‘an ancient tradition’, it is in fact just outdated. Taking animals from the wild and subjugating them for entertainment or sport is fundamentally wrong, should be consigned to history, and is certainly not something that should be supported by Natural England. The wellbeing of these majestic birds should be prioritised over this outdated and cruel hobby, and this decision should be quickly reversed.”Dr Gordon Mellor, chairman of falconry organisation the Hawk Board, said: “Falconers across the world have controlled access to wild populations of raptors following the principles of sustainable use. In this respect UK authorities are following established conservation practice.“UK wildlife legislation is predicated upon the need to conserve and protect wild populations. Given that the peregrine population is currently buoyant, the taking of limited numbers will have no impact upon the wellbeing of that species in the wild.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9062377350b21131d018d2090a256a1aced39214/794_1062_2950_1770/master/2950.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=daf8553dd72f9e507e90982aeec5a7c4 1320w","title":"im trying to make working from home as fun as i can what readers are wearing in lockdown","story":"From donning school uniform to raiding the fancy-dress box, readers share how they are dressing while they are forced to work in the houseTwo weeks ago, Bonita Waldman put on a gold lamé dress that had been crocheted by her 94-year-old mother 40 years ago. “It made me feel close to her,” she says. Her mother was very ill in a care home at the time. Waldman couldn’t visit her, or see anyone else, because of the lockdown. So she worked from home wearing extraordinary outfits and posting the results on Facebook to “cheer up” her friends.She sent a photograph of herself wearing the dress to the care home where the staff printed it out to show her mother. Tragically, her mother died before she could see it. “It’s a sad story,” says Waldman, “but it is also a happy one in a way, because I have these dresses that she made.” Waldman says she will wear more of her mother’s exquisite creations during lockdown, including the wedding dress her mother crocheted for her, as well as “funny outfits” – such as a flamenco dress – to raise friends’ and colleagues’ spirits, as well as her own.We asked our readers what they were wearing in lockdown. Some of the stories, such as Waldmans’, were more poignant than we could ever have anticipated. Some readers said they were simply relieved to be spending more time in elasticated waistbands. Many readers were using clothing as a means of comfort, distraction and fun.“I always choose clothes that lift my mood,” says London-based sewing teacher and fashion designer Karen Arthur (pictured in main image). “Making an effort helps me to feel a little better.” She made her outfit out of a pair of curtains her friend Ian found in his dad’s attic. Although Arthur’s business has ground to a halt, she is making face masks instead. “I brought my sewing machine and some fabrics home with me just before lockdown was announced, thank goodness,” she says.Many of us might feel a bit Miss Havisham all dressed up home alone, but Arthur is far from alone in dressing brightly at this dark time. “My friends and I have made a pact to wear beautiful long party gowns to the supermarket the next time we shop in Sainsbury’s,” says Rachel Bailey-Hogg, who is a lecturer. “It’s all a giggle and hopefully makes others smile too.”Hen, an events assistant from Bristol (pictured in main image), is another believer. “I’ve been pretty much forcing myself to wear as much bright colour as possible,” she says, “to trick myself into brightening my mood and not feeling quite so scared. It’s been a partial success. I’d describe myself as a fairly bold dresser anyway – I’m known at work for wearing big novelty earrings – so I’m trying to lean into that and make WFH as much fun for myself as I can.”Another vivid dresser, Lizzie, wears a cardigan which recalls the children’s rainbow drawings that adorn windows across the UK. This, she says of her outfit, “is peak work-from-home chic. The skeleton leggings cost a fiver and the bones glow in the dark.”Some readers are using clothing to recreate the rhythms of a normal week. “Getting dressed in the morning motivates us to get up and start the day – as does coffee. It is a small daily ritual that gives us something to look forward to,” say 28-year-old art student twins Becky and Alex Chipkin.Antonia, 38, has instigated “fancy Fridays” for video calls with her colleagues. “It makes Friday morning feel like the evening preparations before going out,” she says. Online, attempts to make Fridays feel special through clothing proliferate, with hashags including #DressUpFriday and #FormalFridays often trending on social media.The popular style blog Man Repeller has struck a nerve with the hashtag #goingnowherebutfuckitimgettingdressed, with almost 7,000 people posting photographs of isolation outfits on Instagram.“For many people, dressing is a survival mechanism and at the end of the day, from the most trivial to crucial corners of the human experience, that’s all any of us are trying to do,” says Leandra Medine, founder of Man Repeller. Her own strategies include a dress code for “date nights” with her husband, in which both parties are “required to get dressed, even put on shoes, to meet in the living room”.That makes sense to psychologist Dr Carolyn Mair. “Not knowing when this lockdown will end really is stressful for us – we feel a lack of control,” she says. “Getting dressed is a form of taking control and structuring our day and reassuring ourselves that we have not lost our value. Routine is hugely important.”Some are dabbling with fancy dress in lockdown. Online, photographs of digital project managers wearing jester hats or archaeologists dressed as Power Rangers in Zoom meetings proliferate. Jo Parry, from Cardiff, has pledged to wear a different costume every day, ranging from Cruella de Vil to Gollum. Ella, a 34-year-old climate change scientist, has been raiding her festival fancy-dress box since lockdown began. “I didn’t want to fall into the trap of spending all day mooching around in pyjamas, so I decided to wear something every day that I couldn’t wear to work,” she says. “It has raised more than a few smiles when I’ve been out for my daily dose of fresh air.”Just as many seasoned home-workers extol the mind-focusing values of wearing shoes indoors, some head teachers have advised children to wear school uniform for home schooling, in order to make the “mental switch” required for learning. One reader, Siân, a single parent and film and TV lecturer from Carlisle, has taken this further for morale-boosting purposes. “Having to work from home while also overseeing my daughter’s education and daily activities has been tough,” she says, “so I decided to make it a bit more fun by dressing in our ‘business pyjamas’.”Personal sartorial challenges abound. Some are crafty and intimate: Gina Bennett and Ron Evans have transformed one of Evans’s old T-shirts into a top for Bennett and are now wearing matching outfits for – they insist – the first time ever.Alex Pratchett, from Oxford, a “kit geek” who draws footballers for a living, is alleviating football withdrawal symptoms by wearing “a different football shirt every day until the lockdown ends. If I run out of shirts before it’s over, the virus wins. If nothing else, it will help mark the passage of time, as I was previously struggling to remember which day of the week it was,” he says.Online, creative types whose working lives have stopped abruptly have been using their wardrobes as performance art. Andrew Downs, of the set designers James English Productions, for example, has been wearing vintage clothing to stage baroque, Acorn Antiques-like tableaux for Instagram with his mother and husband. Dressing up, he says, brings “structure. Otherwise you are changing from your day pyjamas into night pyjamas.”But for every person extolling the mood-lifting benefits of dressing as they would have done four weeks ago, there is another revelling in the opportunity to shed their skin.Matt Hepworth, from Bristol, speaks for many in gravitating towards one well-worn item of clothing, in his case a “comfy old raving hoody” because, he says, it “makes me feel young, is warm and I wouldn’t dare ever wear it to work”.Colin, a library assistant in Scotland, is “usually fairly respectfully dressed” at work in a uniform of lilac shirt and smart trousers. The upside of working from home, he says, is getting to wear his favourite band T-shirts. “I wonder if many of the library users would know how much I am into heavy metal, doom metal, heavy rock, grunge and other noisy music genres,” he says.Teacher Emma Leslie is working her way through her wardrobe of casual clothes, which she would never be able to wear at school due to a strict dress code. “It’s not always the most practical thing to be doing but it does help to take my mind off the situation,” she says.Dressing without an audience has proved liberating for many. “My current job is the first place I’ve ever worked where I am out as both queer and non-binary,” says H, a 27-year-old computer programmer. “Working from home has been an interesting experiment as I tend to see connections between my gender and my clothing choices quite a lot. It’s been nice to experiment more with my femininity from the comfort of my own home without the pressures of how I might be perceived by the outside world.” This dress, they say, is a favourite: “It’s super-light and floaty, which puts me in a good positive headspace.”One anonymous 24-year-old says: “I am female, blond, rather petite and have an accent when speaking in English. I was convinced that my appearance decreased my credibility in a rather male-dominated, imposing and English-native environment.” In the office, she says, she was a “power dresser” and saw blazers and heels as a way to appear more “confident and convincing”. After a few days of working from home, “I got more and more comfortable in my casual clothes. I am now receiving calls without video,” which she feels has “balanced out the power dynamics”.Jogging bottoms have never seen so much action. In these unanchored times, even US Vogue editor Anna Wintour has been photographed wearing them. Jyoti, who lives in London, says: “I’m always having to think about that top half people would see on teleconferences but, unless I have to stand up, no one knows what lies under that top half. It’s going to feel weird to go back to smart trousers.”But do clothes really help lift our spirits? Carolyn Mair, believes so, citing a 2012 study in which participants’ ability to pay attention sharply increased when they wore a white coat they believed had belonged to a doctor. What the study suggests, she says, is that it is our own beliefs about our clothes – the stories we attach to them, for example – that can make a difference to our behaviour. “It’s the power of the belief of the wearer,” she says. In other words, one person’s immaculate printed dress is another’s decades-old raving hoodie. And if it works for you, wear it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a148f5ba6131af53561a3f8c92be9702e6644c9c/369_90_2437_1463/master/2437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c37404075122eebf56c53002a148cef3","title":"drew spence phils not spoken to me once is it because of what happened","story":"Chelsea midfielder feels she’s not being given a chance by England after the Eni Aluko fallout but feels valued by her club“I’m not saying I deserve to be in the England squad but I think I deserve to have been given a chance,” says Drew Spence, Chelsea’s longest serving player. A new two-year contract signed in March will take the 27-year-old into her 13th year with the club. Plenty of players have been ditched by Emma Hayes, with the manager unsentimental in her quest for success, but Spence, the only player to have been at the club longer than Hayes, remains firmly in the manager’s plans.It is a huge vote of confidence for the midfielder, yet the respect of one of the most experienced club managers in the game, two league titles, a Spring Series trophy, two FA Cups and, this year, the team’s first League Cup, have not been enough to earn her a place in Phil Neville’s England squad.Spence admits “the squad is difficult to get in, especially my position, because there’s so many good midfielders in England. It’s tough”. However with defenders such as Lucy Bronze and Leah Williamson filling in in midfield and formations tweaked game by game to try to compensate for injuries, the inability of Spence to get a look-in seems odd.“Phil’s not spoken to me once,” says the softly spoken Spence, with no anger but a tinge of disappointment. “To not be given that chance makes me question: ‘Is it because of what happened?’ I think it is because of what happened, if I’m totally honest.”Spence is referring to her involvement in the Mark Sampson racism case. In 2017, when her then Chelsea teammate Eni Aluko spoke to the  about her treatment after taking part in an anonymous questionnaire on the culture within the national team, Spence was pulled into the ring as the unnamed player who, while the only player of colour in the room, had been asked by Sampson how many times she had been arrested. Initially Spence stayed quiet before writing to the FA to confirm Aluko’s account of the event.After a very public and messy series of investigations, the FA “sincerely apologised” to both Spence and Aluko. The latter did not play for England again, but with more than 100 caps and the end of her career a bit closer she was aware she had less to lose by speaking out.Spence, who was 25 and had attended only one England camp, under Sampson, stayed quiet in an attempt to protect her position. “The reason I didn’t speak out straight away was because I was worried,” she says. “I was stressed at the time. There was a lot going on behind closed doors. My main concern was whether it would affect me playing for my country. I’m happy with the decision I took – I didn’t speak out then, it wouldn’t have been right.”She has had one call-up since, for the squad’s training camp in La Manga in the immediate aftermath under the interim manager Mo Marley, but she is a little sceptical of the intent behind her selection, speculating over whether it was to make the FA “look good in the media”. The FA said in a statement on Friday that “players are only ever picked on merit and all English players in the WSL are watched and considered for selection”.Reflecting on the situation triggers a little frustration, but for now Spence is relaxed about her international future. Why? Because at Chelsea she has Hayes’s trust and feels valued. “Right now I’m not losing any sleep over it,” she says. “I’ve got a good career at Chelsea, we’re winning titles, we’re challenging every season, so I’m happy with my status at the moment.”Her life at Chelsea is by no means a walk in the park. Staying in Hayes’s plans is tough. She had eight league starts this season – she started 15 games in 2018-19 – before it was halted by the coronavirus pandemic. “It’s difficult for me because a lot of people always write me off,” she says. “Every year, I’ve got to push myself. I know there’s going to be signings coming in every year.“Emma’s made that clear every season really, to make sure that the squad is pushing again and pushing to another level. It’s just really believing in myself, making sure I’m doing everything right in training every day and competing with the players that come in.”Hayes’s “honesty” in telling her where she needs to improve, and her willingness to adapt and take it on board, is the secret to her longevity at the club. “Emma can rely on me to be put in wherever she’s needed me,” Spence says. “I’ve played higher and lower. I’ve even played out wide sometimes, which is definitely not my game. Emma always wants a player that can play in different positions so she makes you adapt.”Hayes prides herself on building teams of leaders, of finding the “right players”, and that approach has yielded trophies. Before the season was suspended, Chelsea were one point behind Manchester City with a game in hand and a domestic treble in their sights having lifted the League Cup in February.“Obviously, not being in the Champions League this year was even more frustrating. If we don’t win it in the next two years I feel like it’ll be a massive failure to be honest, because the team we have at the moment can easily win the Champions League. I think everyone knows that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5698a5a97bc0921e0b9d1a5c5bb10adb88d23b64/256_79_4095_2458/master/4095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f230fe87f7f83340b39952e15d2163e","title":"premier league return depends on progress of mass testing clubs told","story":"The return of Premier League football is dependent on the roll-out of mass coronavirus testing, clubs learned on Friday.In a two-hour video conference, representatives of English football’s top 20 teams met with league officials to discuss various scenarios for bringing back the competition.While speculation prior to the meeting centred on a proposal from some clubs to curtail the league by 30 June, it is understood the topic was not even discussed as, instead, the medical challenges in resuming the competition came to the fore.League staff have been working with club doctors to devise a series of protocols that would allow top-flight football to return in a “safe and appropriate” manner. These are the rules that would apply in training and matches to safeguard against the spread of the virus.One key aspect of the protocols would be testing. While the presumption is that any resumption of the 2019-20 season would be made behind closed doors, testing of everyone involved in a given event – from players, to coaching and medical staff, match officials and TV broadcast crews – would be necessary.

Currently the UK government claims capacity for 38,000 tests a day across the whole country, with 18,665 carried out on Thursday.The Premier League is clear that football will only return when the government says it is safe to do so and it is understood that the league will seek specific approval for the use of tests. Some clubs are believed to be confident that there will be enough testing capacity to allow matches to be played in June.A Premier League spokesperson reiterated the desire to complete this season if at all possible. “We are acutely aware of the distress Covid-19 is causing and our thoughts are with all those directly affected by the pandemic,” they said.“In common with other businesses and industries, the Premier League and our clubs are working through complex planning scenarios.

This was the fate of the Samoan FA in June 2008 after concerns were raised about the state of its finances. At which point Fifa fired up the corvette and sent in its platoon of tuxedoed Mr Fix-its.Let’s be clear. Nobody wants a visit from this Normalisation Committee. The team of high moral priests sent to the Samoan FA’s door that day were handpicked by a specially convened Fifa emergency committee, a delegation that read, in no particular order: Sepp Blatter, Jack Warner, Issa Hayatou, Michel Platini, Reynald Temarii, Mohammad bin Hammam and Nicolás Leoz.Or to give them their full Seven Dwarves-style nicknames: Six Year Ban Guy, Criminal Charges Guy, TV Rights Fine Guy, Dishonest Payment Guy, Eight Year Ban Guy, Life Ban Guy and of course everyone’s favourite crime-fighting administrator, Interpol Red Notice Guy. Here they come, the lads: a perfumed kerchief held to their noses, here to de-corrupt your football association.Twelve years on the Samoa emergency committee is arguably one of the best jokes modern football has ever come up with. Just how abnormal do you have to be to require this degree of normalising? But then these were the golden years of footballing chicanery, when the yak-hide handbags flowed like wine and when Fifa could basically do as it wished.The anomaly was that Samoa fought back. In a rare show of resistance the Samoan FA appealed to the court of arbitration for sport. It didn’t work. The appeal was rejected and the good times continued to roll at Fifa house, reaching a peak with the bribe-shadowed World Cup bid decisions that would prove an act of hubris even for that thoroughly debauched regime.And so to the present day. Replace one bald, unctuous Swiss with a slightly younger bald, unctuous Swiss and something similar is happening in the Caribbean, a test case for where we may be heading in the struggle for the heart, soul and wallet of world football.The Trinidad \u0026amp Tobago FA experienced its own visit from the Fifa Normalisers in March after another shemozzle over debt. Like Samoa the TTFA has fought back. Another appeal has been lodged at Cas, this time via crowdfunded legal action.Fifa’s move does seem bizarrely aggressive. The deposed TTFA committee had been in place for only four months, having seen off Gianni Infantino’s favoured candidate David John-Williams in a local vote.The TTFA board member Keith Look Loy has accused Fifa of acting like “a colonial absentee landlord”. The former Newcastle, West Ham and Portsmouth goalkeeper Shaka Hislop has called the intervention “a coup”. In an excellent twist the leader of the ousted rebel FA is even called William Wallace. They can take our lives but they’ll never take … our freebies.Much has been made by the ancien régime of Look Loy and co’s historic association with the disgraced Jack Warner, once of the Samoan Normalisation Committee and now avoiding the US justice system.Asked about rumours he might have lobbied for the Wallace campaign – something Wallace fiercely denies – Warner told the broadcaster Andre Errol Baptiste of Port of Spain-based i95.5fm: “Even if that was the case, and by the way that is not the case, and it means that is the beginning of the way to lift football in the country, so be it. What’s wrong with that?” Which pretty much clears that one up.What is actually happening here? This might feel like a dispute at the edge of things, with plenty that is undesirable on both sides, but Fifa’s actions seem extraordinarily high-handed and patrician, even by its own standards, evidence of the increasing hawkishness of the Infantino regime. As the Norwegian Josimar website has pointed out the man in charge of all this normalisation is even one of Infantino’s best friends, his old university chum Véron Mosengo-Omba.This matters right now. There is a great deal up for grabs a month into the total collapse of club football’s broadcast rights power base. This perhaps explains why Fifa’s public statements during the Covid-19 crisis have been almost alarmingly relaxed. Fifa may suspend all international football. Fifa may, we hear, dig into its £2bn cash fund to bail out clubs and leagues.“Never let a serious crisis go to waste” is an overused line in the current uncertainty but you can bet Infantino has it inked on the back of his hand. Make no mistake Fifa has a great deal to gain at a time when every entity that has tried to resist its power, from Premier League to Uefa to the poor old TTFA, is significantly weakened.The collapse of the Blatter-Warner-Platini era hit Fifa hard but not that hard. Money continued to flow but what Fifa really wants is power, most noticeably in its shadow-struggle with club football, where Infantino is convinced it is Fifa’s destiny to take a stronger role.This seemed to be coming to a head late last year as Florentino Pérez presented a breakaway plan led by the richest clubs to cut out domestic leagues, with Fifa seemingly in close, approving pursuit.Exciting new plans come and go. This one seemed as likely as so many others but Covid-19 has shifted the picture even further. Every league, every club is facing a financial nosee, their power tied inexorably to those freeze-framed TV deals. “Football can – and I believe will – play a big part in helping our world recover,” Infantino mused last week, no doubt pondering the majesty of his organisation’s bank balance and with the next major Fifa payday safely tucked away in late 2022.Nobody really knows what the world will look like once normalisation returns to all of us but some certainties do remain. Resistance, as the case of the TTFA demonstrates, is still futile and right now Fifa is in a position to bend that future to its will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09c3f50d30aa739c3d6db8ae64bc3edab63a3fcb/0_0_2128_1277/master/2128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e2ce51eba65c4439787fbc6850f20b9","title":"the fiver bumper weekend retro football entertainment","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!The Fiver’s got the weekend sorted. We’re tempted to go down to Westminster Bridge and stand gormlessly within two metres of as many people as possible, in accordance with new social distancing guidelines. But that would involve getting dressed, so we’ll probably stick to the usual routine of booze and football. Smarter readers may note that the lockdown hasn’t had much impact on The Fiver’s life. The only differences are that the football is old rather than LIVE!, and we’ve had to scale down from Premium to Value Tin. It’s a subtle palate cleanser: moreishly vile, with notes of Bonjela, turps, bleach and desperation, but at least we can afford it.And it goes very well with wall-to-wall association football. There’s a bumper weekend of retro entertainment ahead, including the original Super Sunday and the greatest of all Super Sundays. On Saturday afternoon, BBC1 are showing highlights of the astonishing 1990 FA Cup semi-finals. If you don’t want to know the scores, WELL YOU SHOULD BLOODY WELL KNOW THEM! IT’S THE FIRST THING THEY TEACH ON THE FOOTBALL HISTORY SYLLABUS, YOU DISRESPECTFUL OIK! Crystal Palace 4-3 Liverpool, Oldham 3-3 Manchester United: 13 goals, 13 different scorers, the most dramatic double-header in English football history.Back then they were just two great matches rather than the fulfilment of a slogan. The phrase “Super Sunday” became part of the football lexicon two years later, when it fell out of Richard Keys’ abundant mouth before Sky’s first televised Premier League game. On Sunday afternoon they are repeating Nottingham Forest 1-0 Liverpool in its entirety, though sadly they have stopped short of replaying the full five-hour broadcast: two hours of build-up and another hour after the game. Sky are also repeating a documentary about Arsenal’s Invincible season on Sunday night. Just before that, BT Sport have highlights of Arsenal’s swaggering victories over Juventus and Bayer Leverkusen in 2001-02, and the hammering of Internazionale two seasons later. Look, it doesn’t matter whether they went on to win Big Cup in those seasons. Don’t be a buzzkill. Just live in the moment almost 20 years ago!

It sticks in the memory for two reasons: an Oxford fan was thrown out for chanting during the pre-match minute’s silence to respect the death of the Queen Mother and in the week prior to the game, York’s owner (and self-confessed corporate asset–str1pper John Batchelor) had been refused permission by the FA to play – during the game – a recording of fans singing to boost the atmosphere.

Of course, we then went on to lose to a late, dodgy penalty but it had changed from humiliating to glorious defeat, so we all went to Covent Garden and met loads of other fans in the Dutch pub for an impromptu massive party on Sunday night in London” – Jim Smith.“Can I just point out to Mike Fichtner (yesterday’s letters) that Neither Rochester nor Syracuse are anywhere near I-95 (which connects Boston, New York and beyond).

There was more than a grain of truth in the assertion, though rather than being a menace on the pitch Hunter, whose death at the age of 76 was confirmed on Friday, was simply a brusquely physical defensive presence of a type common at the time.Every team seemed to have a strongman with a memorable and fondly bestowed pet name – Liverpool had Tommy “Anfield Iron” Smith and Chelsea had Ron “Chopper” Harris – and though some of the tackling might be considered hair-raising by modern standards, half a century ago it was just part of the game. In a way Hunter did bite yer legs – opponents had to be good or quick to get past him – but first and foremost he was an excellent defender, not merely the enforcer his sobriquet tends to suggest.Had Hunter not been able to play good football he would have been nowhere near a World Cup final at the age of 22. The reason he was unable to break into the side was because Alf Ramsey had decided Bobby Moore and Jack Charlton formed the best centre-back partnership and neither player became injured or did anything to warrant being replaced. Hunter just had to wait until 1970 but even then he found Everton’s experienced Brian Labone had moved ahead in the queue to play alongside Moore.Hunter did manage to make an appearance in the ill-fated quarter-final against West Germany in Leon. He came on for Martin Peters with nine minutes remaining only to see Uwe Seeler send the game into extra time then Gerd Müller supply the Germany winner.The defender’s luck was no better when he finally managed to break into the England team. He had replaced Moore in the side at long last for the 1973 game against Poland at Wembley that Ramsey’s team needed to win to qualify for the following year’s World Cup but ended up blaming himself for a mistake the visitors capitalised on to take the lead. Though England equalised, the win eluded them and for Ramsey as well as Hunter the World Cup trail came to an abrupt end.While Hunter might have won more than 28 caps had he played at a time when England were not quite as well-equipped with centre-backs, his club career at least was eventful and rewarding. He played 726 times for Leeds after being scouted as a Gateshead schoolboy and signing on at the age of 15, making his debut at 19 and forming a partnership with Charlton that would last a decade.Don Revie’s side were promoted from the Second Division in 1964 and were on course for a league and Cup double in the following season before losing to Liverpool in the 1965 FA Cup final and being pipped to the title by Manchester United on goal average.Compensation for those disappointments arrived later in the decade as Leeds built on their success to become the strongest team in the country as the 60s turned into the 70s. Not necessarily the prettiest or best-liked, as Clough as Leeds manager is notoriously supposed to have pointed out, but there was no arguing with the eventual success under Revie, or that Elland Road had become the most daunting stadium for opposing teams.With Hunter a fixture in the side, Leeds won the title in 1969 and 1974, the FA Cup in 1972, and were losing finalists to Sunderland at Wembley a year later. The 1972-73 season also brought defeat in the European Cup Winners’ Cup final by Milan, a match in which Hunter was dismissed for retaliation at the end amid protests from the crowd over the impartiality of a referee who would receive a ban for match-fixing in subsequent games.However that controversy was nothing next to the heated disputes over disallowed goals and non-awarded penalties that disfigured the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern Munich.Franz Beckenbauer’s side won 2-0, though many still feel that Leeds, now being looked after by Jimmy Armfield after Revie had moved on to England, were cheated in Paris. The violent reaction from sections of the Leeds support resulted in the club being banned from European competition for two years, though it never needed to be applied as the great Elland Road years were effectively over.Hunter moved on to Bristol City in 1976. The £40,000 fee was an eye-catching one for a 33-year-old and Hunter played more than 100 games for the Robins before moving back north to end his career with Barnsley. He tried his hand at management when he finished playing at Oakwell, lasting four years after taking over from Allan Clarke, though a later spell at Rotherham was shorter and his last.Inevitably, perhaps, he spent later years as a meeter and greeter back at Elland Road, where he has a banqueting suite named in his honour. Every club should make the most of its legends, after all, and club legends do not come much bigger or bolder than Norman Hunter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e192ed6e05ceaad7ef9358149c921df090e5931f/0_784_3345_2005/master/3345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13b1d35b914bcd36d282bb4817fa2e31","title":"norman hunter a life in pictures","story":"The former Leeds and England defender Norman Hunter has died at the age of 76 after contracting coronavirus.

Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it’s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we’re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra. Mimicking the ambience of a traditional pub, remote revellers participate in games and quizzes, plus attend talks on subjects ranging from homebrewing to Belgian beer.Even Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall is a fan of Houseparty, the chat app where groups have been throwing virtual dinner parties, staging karaoke singalongs and playing board games. Quarantine quizzes have flourished, too (check out Edinburgh-based Goose’s Quizzes on Twitch), along with online book clubs: Yiyun Li’s #TolstoyTogether sees the author lead fellow bibliophiles in a daily War and Peace reading. Feeling cheeky? Try gatecrashing one of the growing number of nuptials and other parties held online. Hundreds of people tuned in to watch 13-year-old London schoolboy Jude Cannon’s bar mitzvah in his parents’ living room after his original one was cancelled, while in China one wedding was livestreamed to 3 million people. Just don’t expect any free drinks.Online rendezvous: Salon London livestreamed a book club where online audiences engage in Q\u0026ampAs with authors such as Emma Jane Unsworth.Personal trainer Joe Wicks has done a sterling job marshalling the nation’s cooped-up urchins into doing kangaroo hops at 9am. To help the 1.2 million subscribers doing PE with Wicks each morning, internet providers such as Vodafone are flexing to provide the powerful network we rely on to keep our kids active. Domestic dancing has also taken off: see Fame legend Debbie Allen’s Instagram Live lessons (one recent light-the-sky-up-like-a-flame workout attracted 34,000 people), or the English National Ballet’s Tamara Rojo’s Facebook classes.Online rendezvous: Fitness app Urban offers private, livestreamed classes (in yoga, physiotherapy, mindfulness and personal training), pairing you with a self-employed professional whose livelihood may have been affected by the pandemic.In recent weeks, Netflix Party, the Chrome extension that allows groups of friends to watch and comment on series and movies together, at the same time, has turned television into a communal activity again: something that only happens at Christmas or during the World Cup. Its live chat room might be the digi-equivalent of the crisp-packet-rustler down your local multiplex, but there’s no better way to laugh, comment and discuss the intricacies of Joe Exotic’s mullet en masse.Online rendezvous: With many Hollywood films getting early digital releases, a number of stars are hosting interactive events. When sci-fi thriller The Invisible Man hit streaming platforms, director Leigh Whannell held a Twitter live group-watch answering viewers’ questions in a virtual Q\u0026ampA afterwards.Ever wanted to learn how to spoon carve? Master the oboe? Speak the Cyrillic alphabet from A to Я? There’s never been a better time to pick up new skills as specialists everywhere dispense their wisdom via one-on-one video tuition. A quick online search should throw up a willing tutor for whatever whimsy you have, whether it’s cake decorating, choir practice or Colombian cookery. Meanwhile, InterPals, My Language Exchange and Italki pairs anybody eager to learn a language with a native speaker on Skype or FaceTime.Online rendezvous: Over on Zoom, Cocktails After Dark features out-of-work bartenders teaching viewers how to make drinks (plus earning much-needed tips in the process). And MasterClass features video classes from the likes of Martin Scorsese, Serena Williams, Werner Herzog, Annie Leibovitz, Aaron Sorkin, Herbie Hancock and Neil Gaiman.Travel might be on pause at the moment, but people are still globetrotting vicariously. An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites. Wildlife fans can ogle webcams showing brown bears emerging from hibernation in Alaska’s Katmai National Park, majestic pachyderms and other charismatic megafauna at South Africa’s Tembe Elephant Park, or sea otters sploshing around at Monterey Bay Aquarium.Online rendezvous: The Scandi trend for slow TV is seemingly tailor-made for these trapped-inside times. Fire up the three-hour-long Sailing to Tobago YouTube video on your laptop, fix quarantini-inspired rum cocktails and stream a destination-appropriate calypsoyacht rock playlist and you’ll be gliding (imaginary) crystalline Caribbean waters in no time.“I’ll find a way to deal with the ennui,” declared Christine and the Queens recently. Her method was throwing herself into near-daily live performances from a Paris studio on Instagram. Other musicians have been livestreaming shows, too, such as Neil Young, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, Charli XCX and more. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization’s #TogetherAtHome concert series has featured John Legend and Chris Martin. A virtual Live Aid-style charity concert is surely in the offing.Online rendezvous: New York’s politan Opera House has been livestreaming an opera every night on its website.Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWhile we’re stuck indoors, it’s never been more important to keep connected with your friends and family.

The threat by Matt Hancock to remove this privilege was silently welcomed by me (although at the time of writing the health secretary has yet to follow through on it). The kids have no interest in going for a walk. They have fully embraced the oceans of videogame time that the lockdown has afforded them.When this first started, my wife and I wanted to protect the children from getting anxious about what was going on. Now I wonder if there’s a good way to inject some anxiety into them, because they are having the time of their bloody lives.After the initial protests, we left the house together, with the kids showing such levels of reluctance that I worry if anyone sees us they might assume they are captive and notify the police. The stress is added to by the fact that we have moved into an unprecedented new era of social etiquette, and so accepted rules have not yet fallen into place. Everybody you come across has the potential to spark outrage because they are not adhering to your specific set of expectations and you are not adhering to theirs.My wife wants to maintain as much distance as possible, and so as soon as we see anybody heading towards us, she moves the kids across the road, before being annoyed that the other party didn’t make the first move. I pointed out to her that we crossed as soon as we saw the oncoming walkers, so it might be argued that she was expecting them to cross before they saw us, which felt unreasonable.Ordinarily, I wouldn’t have said anything, but we have now spent so much time together we are sharing opinions like that with each other. The other day she said the way I put the hot sauce back into the cupboard could be described as “eye-gougingly annoying”. I thanked her for her feedback.My wife has also expressed a distaste for people failing to say thank you after we cross for them. It has been thoroughly pissing her off. We would cross the road, walk past the ungrateful pricks, and then my wife would loudly whisper, “You’re welcome!”She was then put to the test when we did encounter somebody who crossed to avoid us before we had the chance. I waited silently as we walked past them for a “thank you” from my wife, which never came. I was incredibly excited by the prospect of bringing this up, but I stayed casual.“I think my hearing might be going,” I said, “but I didn’t hear you thanking them.” My wife explained to me that she wanted to say thank you, but at no point did they make the requisite eye contact. She also pointed out it could be argued that a man who hadn’t instigated the walk, got the kids ready or taken any kind of ownership of the outing, but instead made snidey comments, could be described as an arsehole. I thanked her for her feedback.We then glanced backwards and saw another couple walking behind us as we approached the final straight before our house. We thought nothing of it until they started to accelerate. We sped up, and then they did too, as if we were hogging the middle lane. For the last section of our walk, we were essentially involved in a chase. We speedwalked on to our street and into our house before expressing our disbelief at the inconsiderates behind us.Regardless of how tough things get, what will always bring a family together is annoyance at other people. And keeping your promise not to put your argument during the family walk into your column. Sorry.

At last, I can find joy in nature – in my own back gardenI have a memory that I cannot clearly place. It was six or seven years ago and I was watching a segment on breakfast television about how many urban children cannot recognise well-known British wildlife by sight or sound.I was one of those children. My summer holidays were spent at home, bored, under east London’s concrete canopy. Wildlife highlights were foxes and the odd rat, creatures to be feared because nature was unpredictable, and sometimes even perverse (viz, the common city pigeon, cannibalistically picking at discarded fried chicken bones).I’ve spent most of my adult life trying to unlearn that perspective. My eyes were opened by country friends at university who, shockingly, never came back from summer having been trampled by a cow. I have since pored over documentaries, visited nature centres and been trekking. I figured if the mountain would not come to me, I would go to the mountain.So I was crushed when, after watching the TV segment, I took the same nature test as the children, only to fail. I could not identify a weasel and thought samphire was an app. I still knew nothing. I wondered if it was too late.This week I feel differently. My West Country boyfriend’s family sent him a box of Cornwall fish for his birthday, which we identified online. I can recognise several fish. Stuck at home, our humble garden has become our world. If I sit still long enough, eventually the birds will hop on to the table. I recognise some chirps. I still want to scream when they wake me up with their incessant singing, but I know which bird I want to scream at.Strange to think the most transformative module in my nature education took place in a city flat, but it turns out the mountain was there all along. The trick is to sit still enough to realise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f529c02a247a47497c6d4c7a83eab3475a6fad4/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5f2ef9f9a72dea0c773b16afcfa40b6","title":"why has my mother become so critical of others as she ages","story":"Could she be angry and bitter as a defence against feeling sadness, pain, disappointment and possibly depression, asks Annalisa Barbieri I am getting increasingly worried about – and frustrated with – my mother, who wants me to listen while she criticises everyone else in the family and seems offended that I don’t want to join in.It’s possible that she’s always done this and I’ve only just noticed. Certainly, I was painfully aware in adolescence of her frustrations with my father (whom she loves dearly) and her grievances against other family members, which caused me huge anxiety.Now that she’s a bit older, a spitefulness has emerged, initially focused on my siblings’ partners as their relationships fell apart. I dread spending time alone with her or having phone calls where she wants me to agree with her criticisms of family and friends.I have tried ignoring the comments, but she is extremely persistent – and at one point stopped talking to me when I pointed out how she was behaving. I want to be supportive, but it is increasingly difficult to trust her, and I avoid meaningful conversation beyond logistics of grandchildren, towards whom my parents are loving and indulgent.I realise I’ve made her sound like a monster when in fact she can be kind and generous and loyal. She is very worried about losing my father, who is kind, gentle and energetic but has health issues. She is a clever, creative person, and this makes it even harder to accept that this nastiness is part of her personality rather than something I can help her overcome. I don’t want their happy lives to end in bitterness.If others think this is a radical change in your mother’s personality, it might be worth getting her checked out by a GP. Your dad would be the right person to ask. But sometimes we get to stages in our lives where we suddenly see our parents anew.I thought your problem was in some ways very normal – I hear a lot of similar stories anecdotally. I think many people, as they age, become more critical, less tolerant and feel more able to voice these thoughts, however negative.I want to stress that neither Shmueli nor I knows if your mother is depressed, but it’s a possibility. “When you’re angry, you don’t have to feel sad,” explained Shmueli, “you don’t have to feel dependent or powerless. You can just be really angry and criticise others, and it can be all their fault. It’s unconscious, but by doing this your mother avoids feeling sad and vulnerable.”In other words, when the truth is too painful to hold within us, we project. So I asked Shmueli what he felt was at the core of your mother’s sadness, and his hunch was that the big issue was your dad’s ill health. You mention it at the end, and yet Shmueli felt it was central to your mother’s anguish: there’s the unspoken sadness hinted at in your last line – that your mother and father’s time is limited. He didn’t think it was a coincidence that her focus was on the ex-partners of your siblings, that is, those who have left.The probable reality is that your mother was always a bit like this, but something is crystallising this aspect of herself. And the catalyst is probably fear of loss and greater dependency. Fear tends to strip away our defences. While your mum is criticising other people, she doesn’t have to look at herself.Ideally your mum would talk to someone about this, but I asked Shmueli how you should react when your mother starts criticising and tries to enlist you. He suggested saying, “I can see you’re upset, Mum, what are you so unhappy about?” It won’t be easy, because this turns the criticism around and exposes her own vulnerability – but it may be a start in helping her.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

One unexpected side-effect of the pandemic has been the enormous increase in viewing among teenagers, potentially signalling the return of families watching TV together.“The way the media market works is on supply and demand,” said Stephen Allan, chief executive of the major media buying agency MediaCom, referring to the enlarged audiences available to advertisers and the fall in the number of companies wanting to buy adverts to reach them. “What broadcast media are facing is a perfect storm, where supply has gone up hugely but demand has gone down.”He said that while some of his clients are talking about increasing their advertising spend when the lockdown ends, he fears channels will run out of new programmes to bring in audiences, as no shows have been made during the lockdown.“Stuff that was being made is not going to be there, in terms of the more typical dramas or sitcoms. So what are they going to show?”These fears are widespread, with popular soaps such as EastEnders and Coronation Street already cutting the number of episodes they screen to try to avoid running out of pre-filmed material.“For at least two years you’re going to see less money on screen,” said Tom Harrington of Enders Analysis, who predicted a severe shortage of scripted dramas. Actors and directors will have committed to filming multiple projects, he said, with schedules that now overlap.Meanwhile, ITV sources confirmed reports that filming of Love Island, one of the channel’s main cashcows, has been delayed until August at the earliest, and could even be filmed in the UK rather than on a Spanish island.And Channel 4 has slashed its programme budget by a quarter to ensure survival, raising fears that the collapse of domestic commissioning budgets will mean less distinctively British television will get made.Newspapers face threat of closure as advertisers fleeThe British newspaper industry is facing an existential threat, with the National Union of Journalists warning many papers will close permanently as a result of the pandemic, and thousands of journalists will lose their jobs.Newspaper websites are seeing record readership levels but little income, as advertisers have slashed budgets or blocked their promotions from appearing alongside coronavirus-related stories. There are also signs that news audiences are starting to decline as people get used to the lockdown.Free websites are often cross-subsidised by print sales, but the model is being hit hard. Although there has been an increase in people using services such as Deliver My Newspaper, national newspaper sales are down by about a fifth, with staff at News UK asked to tweet urging people to buy a paper in an attempt to drive up sales.Streaming and gaming look to fill the gapNetflix has been among the biggest winners, with its soaring share price meaning the company is now worth more than the oil multinational ExxonMobil. However, it is facing its own issues, with production of hit shows such as Sex Education paused owing to the pandemic. YouTube has also enjoyed enormous viewership, but its creators have suffered falls in ad revenue, which is also likely to dent profits at Facebook and Google.Sky and BT Sport have been badly affected by the absence of sport, with many people pausing or cancelling their subscriptions – but there are growth areas. Viewers have turned to gaming, with popular consoles such as the Nintendo Switch sold out in many stores.Cinema releases have been upendedThe global film release schedule has been upended by the pandemic, with cinemas closed for the foreseeable future and films stacking up as they miss their release dates.The UK cinema industry is likely to lose £400m in ticket sales as 52 million cinema-goers stay at home, based on equivalent figures from 2019. Industry chiefs hope audiences will return to see delayed blockbusters such as Wonder Woman 1984, the latest James Bond, No Time to Die, and Mulan. However even when the lockdown is lifted, consumers might take a while to be comfortable squeezing into cinema seats next to strangers.Some films are opting to go down the modern equivalent of the direct-to-video route, with Trolls World Tour, a children’s film, made available on streaming services after its cinema release was cancelled. Other films, such as Keira Knightley’s Misbehaviour, which was released in cinemas just days before the lockdown, have been rush-released for download.The BBC hopes it has saved itselfAt the start of the year the BBC was under attack from all sides, and the licence fee could yet be decriminalised. But after attracting plaudits from ministers for its role in a crisis, and with its stable source of funding not affected by the advertising collapse, it has a chance to prove its value."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79e6291e772500279c0f57072e8db6ac4630f555/0_0_4961_3308/master/4961.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=99797ca7dc8208fe795ac1fd69f84948 2020w","title":"everyones stuck at home so why are people streaming less music lady gaga dua lipa","story":"Streaming was supposed to be the music industry’s silver lining during the pandemic, but figures have been going down Major album releases used to be put through a Large Hadron Collider of marketing, but now almost everything making those promotion particles accelerate has been switched off. So how do you push an album when the beamlines are down?The music business is a highly interconnected ecosystem. Remove one part and everything else sways like a Jenga tower in a hurricane. Months of teasing, dropping singles and doing interviews are carefully synchronised to set up a release, and the next year-and-a-half is spent whipping along that momentum with more releases, touring and TV promotion. But now those failsafes have crumbled. It is partly why Dua Lipa brought her album forward before the promotional bridge completely collapsed. It is also why Lady Gaga and Sam Smith pushed theirs back in the hope that things will return to something resembling normal when they finally drop.With physical sales now at a slow dribble, first-week chart performances – normally boosted by limited-edition, fan-seducing formats – are entering the 100m dash with their ankles tied to their wrists. Dua Lipa’s album was beaten to No 1 in the UK by 5 Seconds of Summer, who had pre-sold a glut of cassettes to fans and nosed ahead. That marketing trick will not happen again for a while.Even if the public are less interested in the charts than ever, they remain a powerful industry barometer of commercial success, showing those outside of record labels (radio, TV, live) that a campaign is working. The rest of the industry loves jumping on a proven hit but it flinches when it starts to smell like a miss.The music industry, inured to gravitational shifts two decades after Napster, will find ways to fill the nothingness. Much of this is likely to come from artists on social media – like Charli XCX who is writing and recording an album in lockdown – who will push albums out from the vacuum of space until everyone can hear them stream."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8174786b06f0657d784fa33e0dead4d46382be26/0_0_5000_2813/master/5000.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68fe54869d9afaf76ba6ee144f167e51","title":"uk coronavirus live lockdown last three weeks dominic raab latest updates","story":"Daily UK deaths rise by 847 Rishi Sunak extends furlough scheme. This live blog has now closed - for the latest coronavirus developments, please follow the global live blogThat’s it from us today on the UK side. Thank you to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with tips and suggestions, and to all of you for reading along.If you’d like to continue following the ’s coverage of the worldwide picture, head over to our global live blog.Here are the main points from the press conference.First of all, we’ve got to get a vaccine. That isn’t two days away, it’s not two months away. Making a vaccine is a difficult, complicated process. It doesn’t only have to work, it has to be safe, and of course for a disease like this it has to be very safe if you are going to use it right across the population. So there is a lot to do before we’re in that position.And later he said:Just to put some realism on vaccine development, each single project does not have a high probability of success.So although everyone goes out with great enthusiasm and we hope they work, it’s never the case that you know you’ve got a vaccine that’s going to work. So that’s the first thing that we need to be sure of. The second thing is then the safety and it’s incredibly important that these vaccines are tested properly, that’s why it takes some time to get to the clinical trials and understand the potential unwanted effects of a vaccine.And then only when that has been done can this be used widely across the population and so those are the stages we need to go through.The evidence is quite variable around masks. It’s not easy to really get a firm position on some of it, and there aren’t really good trials of masks. We are looking at the evidence now. We’ve looked at it this week twice. We’re going to look at it again on Tuesday and hope to be able to make some advice around whether any changes are needed or not at the moment. We’re entirely in line with the WHO recommendations. The difference between this disease and others is the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic spread which adds an added complexity to where masks may or may not fit into this. Sharma ends by thanking people for the sacrifices they are making.And he repeats the message about staying at home to protect the NHS.Q: Why are you going ahead with HS2 when money is so short?Sharma says it is important to support the construction sector. And the government should keep the economy going where it can.Q: There is a disproportionately high number of deaths in the West Midlands. Do you know why?Doyle says they expected cities to be hit first.But other factors are relevant. For example, they are looking at areas where there are lots of care homes.Q: Will West Midlands hospitals get the PPE they need?Sharma says he is aware of the supply problems. But there is a global supply issue. He pays tribute to businesses that have stepped in to supply PPE.Q: Will you commit to ensuring care workers have full sick pay?Sharma says a whole range of support is provided.He says the government very much values the heroes that we have.Q: Was it a mistake for the government to dismiss essential workers as low-skilled labour?Sharma says everyone in government wants to pay tribute to the work of NHS workers.Q: Dominic Raab talks yesterday about possibly strengthening the lockdown in some areas. In which areas? Geographically, or by sector?Sharma says he does not want to “muddy the waters” by speculating.Vallance says there are a number of options. But it is too early to be talking about them.Q: Are you considering recommending the use of face masks for people on public transport?Sharma says Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, is looking at this.Vallance says Sage is looking at this. The evidence is variable. He says there may be a decision on Tuesday. He says at the moment the UK is in line with WHO advice.Q: You told the CBI earlier they would have to get used to a new normal. What did you mean by that? Will some restrictions have to stay in place until there is a vaccine?Sharma says the government is asking people to work from home if they can. But this is not always possible.He says employers will have to adapt the way they work, so they can keep people safe.Q: Are you saying you expect people to carry on working from home until there is a vaccine?Sharma says the lockdown has been extended for three weeks. But there are exceptions, he says. He says he has been emphasising that, in those circumstances, employers must follow Public Health England guidance.Q: Have there been any findings from investigations into the deaths of NHS workers from coronavirus?Doyle says the investigations are under way.Not all of these are workplace deaths, she says.And she says it is important to get these investigations right.Q: Oxford scientists have said they are so confident that their vaccine will work that they are going to manufacture 1m doses. What will you do to make sure the UK is first in the queue to buy it?Sharma says this is a reference to the Edward Jenner Institute. He has spoken to them, and is supporting the work that they are doing.Vallance says these researchers have done a great job. But there are over 100 vaccine projects around the world. There are at least two, or perhaps three, in the clinic.But most vaccine trials do not work, he says.He says you can only use vaccines when you know they are safe.He says the vaccine can come from anywhere. The domestic effort is being supported. But it might come from somewhere else.We just need to back lots of horses at the moment.And we may need more than one vaccine, he says.Q: When might businesses get back to normal? Was Nadine Dorries right to say it will only be when there is a vaccine?Sharma says people will understand why the lockdown has been extended.The government will always be led by the scientific advice, he says.Q: What can you say to the tourism sector? Will there be a summer season?Sharma says he speaks to businesses every day.The government has given support for businesses in this sector. The furlough scheme has been extended.But this is a tough time, he says.Q: Some 21,000 tests were carried out yesterday. How will you get to 100,000 a day by the end of the month?Sharma says the capacity is for 38,000 tests a day. And there are 26 drive-through testing centres. They are doing everything they can to hit this target, he says.Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director for Public Health England, claims they are on track to meet the target.Q: When you get a vaccine, who will get it first?Vallance says this is not immediate. It is not two days away, nor two months away.When you have a vaccine, you vaccinate the most vulnerable first.But they are not at that stage yet.Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, is presenting the daily slides.On transport use, he says there is some evidence in places where there is little coronavirus of people ignoring social distancing rules. They should not.Here is the testing data.Vallance says this next slide is the most important.He says more than 5,500 people are involved in clinical trials.The number of hospital cases are not only plateauing, but going down in some places.That will mean fewer people going to intensive care, he says.But he says this process will take weeks.Here is the final slide, with death figures.Sharma says producing a vaccine will be a colossal undertaking. He says it will take any months. And there is no guarantee of success.But he is proud of the way Britain has stepped up to the challenge.We are a country with a rich history of pioneering science, he says.Earlier the government sent out an embargoed press release with more details of the vaccine taskforce that Alok Sharma has just announced. Here is an excerpt.The taskforce, led by Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan van Tam, will support efforts to rapidly develop a coronavirus vaccine as soon as possible by providing industry and research institutions with the resources and support needed. This includes reviewing regulations and scaling up manufacturing, so that when a vaccine becomes available, it can be produced quickly and in mass quantities.Representatives from government, academia and industry are coming together to form the Taskforce. Members will include government life sciences champion Sir John Bell, as well as AstraZeneca, and the Wellcome Trust. Alongside the creation of the taskforce, the government is also announcing that 21 new coronavirus research projects will benefit from funding worth around £14m. Giving details, it says:One new project led by the University of Oxford will trial an anti-malarial drug believed to have anti-inflammatory properties to determine whether it could diminish the effects of Covid-19 on people in high risk groups. GP surgeries across the UK have been invited to take part in this ground-breaking trial, to ascertain whether it could reduce the need for affected patients to go to hospital and speed up their recovery.Other projects receiving vital government funding from this new pot include:Imperial College London testing a vaccine against coronavirus that aims for the body to produce more protective antibodiesPublic Health England developing a new antibody that could offer protection against infection and disease progression of coronavirusPublic Health England studying how Covid-19 can be transmitted from person-to-person by determining how long it can survive in the air and on different materials found in hospitals and households like fabric, plastics, metals and ceramics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/933f9e370a87924c8ab4f5085291a1c54265469d/0_79_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d58967c95ee0b721ad6d6583eda679","title":"international space station crew return to earth","story":"American and Russian crew touch down in Kazakhstan after months on International Space StationThe three-person crew of the International Space Station returned to Earth on Friday morning, arriving back to a world that has been radically transformed by coronavirus in the time they were away.Space travel is often a journey into the unknown, but for Americans Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, and Russian Oleg Skripochka, their return to Earth may bring more surprises than the time they spent in orbit. The trio’s landing capsule touched down on the Kazakh steppe in the early hours of the morning.Morgan had been at the ISS for nine months, his first space mission, while Meir and Skripochka blasted off six months ago, back when shaking hands and hugs were still normal greetings, international travel was routine and there was not even a hint of the virus that would emerge in Wuhan and make its way around the globe.The trio got an early hint of the new world they had arrived in as they were met by a recovery crew wearing face masks and rubber gloves, who pulled them out of their landing capsule. Russian officials said the team assigned to aid the crew had been under medical observation for a month, including tests for coronavirus. It was also cut to a minimum of essential personnel.“Please keep your distance,” one ground crew member could be heard telling another, in footage released by Russia’s space agency.Following the medical checkup, the crew boarded helicopters to Baikonur, the Russian launch site in the Kazakh steppe. From there, Skripochka will travel to Moscow. Morgan and Meir had a longer journey ahead of them: a nearly 200-mile drive to the city of Kyzylorda, and from there a flight back to the US. A closer airport has been closed to international flights due to the coronavirus. “It’s a little bit difficult for us to feel like we’re truly going back to a different planet,” Meir said in a television interview conducted when she was still aboard the ISS earlier this week.“We were really the only three humans that were not subject to that at the current time. Billions of humans were dealing with this in some way or another and the three of us weren’t.”Isolation and quarantine is not likely to be too challenging for the crew, who are used to the long months aboard the ISS. Meir said the best tips for surviving long periods of isolation were ensuring daily exercise, keeping a regular schedule, treating those around with kindness and making sure to have fun.On Thursday, Russian officials reported the first case of coronavirus at Star City, the complex outside Moscow which serves as the control room and training hub for space flights. The director of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said on Wednesday that there were currently 30 cases of coronavirus among employees.Even minor illnesses can be disastrous in space, with the Apollo 7 mission in 1968 severely hampered when one of those on board developed a cold soon after blastoff and quickly passed it to the others. For this reason, crews undergo a rigorous quarantine procedure for a month prior to departure.Due to coronavirus, these procedures were made even stricter than usual for the new crew at the ISS, who blasted off from Baikonur last week. As well as daily medical checks, all living spaces were regularly chemically cleaned. The launch took place without the usual fanfare and guest attendances.Astronauts Chris Cassidy, from the US, and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner will spend six months on the ISS. Before blastoff, Cassidy said part of him was pleased to be leaving Earth at the most uncertain time in a generation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12f38c31eaf1bce655181d2b0adc8768a36d0840/0_157_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcb8f9d6e89eb85f229050c6faab5cec","title":"tell us how is life in lockdown affecting your gambling","story":"Are you gambling less?

The second World Cup semi-final at Twickenham in 1999 seems like yesterday to me even though Émile Ntamack, France’s left-wing on that autumn day, now watches his son play for their country. No one in the stadium will ever forget it. At the end, and I kid you not, I turned round from my seat in the East stand press box and grown men were actually weeping.Context is all. This wasn’t just an astonishing spectacle. It came, like so many French performances in World Cups, completely out of the blue. The All Blacks were so far ahead of everyone it wasn’t true. Jonah Lomu was in his pomp and their backline, with Christian Cullen, Tana Umaga and Jeff Wilson operating outside Andrew Mehrtens, were cutting other teams to shreds.Earlier in the competition New Zealand cold-bloodedly scored 101 points against Italy in Huddersfield. They had been beaten in the final four years ago when Nelson Mandela was South Africa’s 16th man and they were going to make no mistakes this time.France were their usual flaky but often brilliant selves and nobody was giving them a hope. This view was shared by the ’s newly appointed rugby correspondent. “I’ll do Australia against South Africa, should be pretty good, and you can watch the All Blacks beat France,” the sage-like Robert Kitson told me during the week. (He may not have used those actual words but you have to allow me a little one-upmanship and smugness for this feature).And so it came to pass. Rob watched the thrilling spectacle of Matt Burke kicking eight penalties against the holders while I, bless him, went to Twickenham 24 hours later to witness what Paul Simon might have called “a day of miracles and wonders”. My only regret is that the following weekend Australia beat a flat France, perhaps shattered after their semi-final efforts , in the dullest final ever.All was going to the script as New Zealand ran up a 24-10 lead. A black tidal wave threatened to submerge France. Lomu powered through the tackles of Xavier Garbajosa, Philippe Bernat-Salles and Fabien Galthié as if they were so much dead wood in an autumn gale. The full-back Garbajosa later admitted that he had deliberately ed the wrong way to avoid the express train that was Lomu and who could blame him? Poor France, their Six Nations wooden spoon earlier that year was going to be followed by a humiliation witnessed by millions.And then the rugby world was turned upside down. France scored 33 points without reply. Their fly-half Christophe Lamaison, only in the side because Thomas Castaignède was injured, kicked two drop-goals and two penalties. France were within touching distance. Fear gripped the All Blacks. Surely they couldn’t muck this one up? We were on the edge of our seats.The scrum-half Galthie, now France’s head coach, kicked a teasing up-and-under down the left touchline. Christophe Dominici thundered after it and raced round Mehrtens to score. France were ahead. Pandemonium broke out. The French pack rumbled forwards.By this time Lamaison could do nothing wrong. His chip bounced into the arms of Richard Dourthe, who scored another. With five minutes to go, though, New Zealand still had shots to fire. Mehrtens flung a pass to Umaga but the wing could not hold it and Lamaison kicked the ball from the French 22. Olivier Magne hacked it on into the New Zealand half and Bernat-Salles won the race with Wilson to plunge over.There was no way back despite Wilson’s last-minute reply. Never before had the All Blacks conceded so many points in a World Cup game. I’ve been lucky enough to see two other remarkable World Cup games live, Fiji against Wales at Nantes in 2007 and Japan beating South Africa in Brighton in 2015 are up there, but nothing matches this.When I got my breath back I phoned the  sports desk. “I’ve just seen the greatest game in the history of the World Cup,” I said. “Yes, we know,” came the weary reply. (I was forgetting that everyone was watching on telly.) “That’s why we’ve cleared the front page.” Ah. Happy days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f390ef8468a0778547f0ff0e64859fe7bdafc1e8/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=344177461e073c6fab979ea8addda9b4","title":"brian dennehy remembered by clare higgins","story":"In Death of a Salesman, Dennehy – who died aged 81 this week – was generous, committed and like a jazz musician on set, says his co-starI first met Brian in New York in 2003 when I was doing Vincent in Brixton on Broadway and he came backstage to say he’d enjoyed it. Two years later I was gobsmacked to be cast as Linda opposite him in Death of a Salesman in London. Brian had already won a Tony award for his performance in New York. He’d been a complete sensation. Arthur Miller adored him. He’d say: “Some people think Willy Loman should be small but Brian’s the biggest guy – and the bigger they come, the harder they fall.”When he came to London, Brian didn’t just hang on to his Tony-winning performance. He chucked it up in the air. Here he was rehearsing with a mostly British cast and he said: “Give me whatever you’ve got.” Talk about no ego. Brian had a huge heart and the humility to be a great actor. He had this incredible generosity to other actors on stage – he knew you’re doing something bigger than yourself. We were talking for Arthur Miller. After one performance he said to me that this is what church ought to be – it’s people getting together in a dark place under the canopy of the greatest 20th-century playwright and we’re all in it together.Brian was a jazz fanatic. In the scene where Willy is with his employer in the office, when he knows his life has finished, he would tap the set, use his feet on the floor and play that stage like a jazz musician.I’ve never run to work for a Wednesday matinee but I did with Brian. We did Salesman for six months in the West End, and at the end of every performance there was a sound I’d never heard before: English men weeping helplessly. I used to hand out Kleenex. Men would say: “My dad was like that.”Politically, we were poles apart. He’d tell me: “You goddamn socialist … but I love your NHS.” I’d say: “Brian, you’re such a big Chicago bullshitter.” He’d reply: “You got me, mamma!” The air went blue when he was talking. After every matinee he’d say: “My goddamn motherfuckin’ knees are letting me down.” He was in his late 60s and they’d been replaced with titanium ones.One afternoon, just before we opened, Brian told me how much the play meant to him and how he’d been scared to do it in England. I can remember his face when he won his Olivier award. He was a titan of an actor – big, brash but so gentle and understanding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e8c2369c32e612c1087059b03f6fd44ded3519c/392_0_4174_2507/master/4174.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db21d80223ec8bc1c907fb1958ef1a30","title":"the royle family makes me properly laugh stacey dooleys lockdown tv","story":"The documentary maker reveals how Ricky Tomlinson and co remind her of her childhood, and why the stars of Netflix’s Tiger King are just as bad as each otherI’m really antisocial, so just sitting on the sofa and having a cup of tea is my idea of heaven. I’m trying to politely decline all the Zoom offers that are being thrown my way and I’ve been watching lots of TV instead.In terms of total escapism, something I’ve been going back to is my favourite sitcom: The Royle Family. I watched it when it was first shown, but I didn’t appreciate just how clever it was. It was always on in the background because my family loved it, but I was a bit more passive. I sat down a couple of weeks ago and went through it all again and realised how the cast are the most brilliant actors. It’s one of the only series that makes me properly laugh.It’s quite nostalgic for me, too, because their house looks like the house we grew up in and it feels very familiar – it’s like sitting in the living room with your own family. One of my favourite episodes is when they go to Prestatyn. They rarely leave the house, so it’s a big deal for them to be off on their holidays. Then they get to the caravan and Jim’s got the hump because there’s no chip pan and the telly isn’t that good. It really tickles me. I love Ricky Tomlinson as an actor and he’s such a sweetheart in real life he’s a really charitable man and very generous with his time.My partner, Kev, and I sat down on the sofa and got through five or six episodes in one go. It’s a running joke that Antony’s always sent to get the tea in the show – he’s the dogsbody – and that’s like Kev and I, taking it in turns to delegate and winding each other up.The other show I’ve got into is Tiger King. I do this all the time when people are talking about a show – for some reason, I only watch it later, mainly because I’m not in on the jokes and all the memes that are going around. Eventually, I gave in with Tiger King and it’s just so captivating – the characters are so charismatic and, even if I fundamentally disagree with most of what they stand for, I’m still so drawn to them. You’d believe it if it was fiction, but as real life it almost makes no sense.As a film-maker myself, it’s also amazing to see the access the team got for Tiger King and to be able to dedicate that amount of time to one story. That’s a luxury that few of us have now. It got me thinking about a documentary I made on big game hunters a few years ago in South Africa. I remember there was a debate around conservation there and it was less black and white to me, because they donated a lot of their hunted meat to the orphanages in the surrounding areas and they were assuring us that they didn’t shoot anything that was endangered.Stacey Dooley: Locked Up With the Lifers is on BBC Two on 19 April and Stacey Dooley: Costa Del Narcos is on BBC Two on 26 April at 9pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2ae4fb41865b5e0d1cf9f6c0bc9041685aa606f/0_169_5164_3098/master/5164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0731c04229b616b41449396137907b03","title":"joe biden presidential campaign online lockdown coronavirus","story":"The presumptive Democratic nominee is adapting as pandemic curbs have thrown traditional campaigning into disarrayFormer vice-president Joe Biden’s presidential campaign has had to adapt to both its new status as the Democratic party’s presumptive nominee and as a candidate who can’t leave his home to campaign due to the coronavirus pandemic.That means taking the fight to unseat Donald Trump from the White House in November almost entirely online.Instead of shaking hands in swing states or giving speeches in arenas, Biden’s most visible moments in recent weeks have been in front of a camera broadcasting from his basement. But the Biden campaign has begun embracing the new reality. He has started a regular podcast where he’s interviewed political figures. Virtually every day his campaign airs a live stream of him taking questions or having a discussion with an elected official.Ron Klain, a longtime aide to Biden, critiqued Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus in a roughly five-minute YouTube video. Biden over the various channels has focused on how he would approach the pandemic differently and what he sees as Trump’s failures.“I think his positioning on ‘if I were president, this is what I would be doing’ is a smart place to be,” said veteran Democratic strategist Michael Halle, who recently served as a top adviser to the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign.Biden has upped the frequency of his appearances on television, appearing on major cable networks and local stations almost daily over the past two weeks. On Facebook, the Biden campaign more than doubled the amount of money spent on ads in the last week compared with the Trump campaign. Trump, though, has still spent more overall on that platform.Biden campaign fundraisers are also now virtual, changing the logistics of organizing them and who can appear as a headliner, including former rivals. The California senator Kamala Harris was the surprise guest at his second virtual fundraiser in April.“In some respects it does make the barriers to pulling off these things much smaller,” Democratic strategist Eli Kaplan said.In the next few weeks the Biden campaign’s fundraising schedule, according to a list obtained by the , includes a Women for Biden event headlined by his wife Dr Jill Biden and daughter Ashley Biden, a virtual fireside chat with the candidate, and another fundraiser in late April featuring celebrities Kristin Chenoweth, Melissa Etheridge, Billie Jean King and Billy Porter.The campaign is also planning to set up a digital “ropeline” where Biden can interact with voters.But even with all those changes, Biden is still having difficulty competing with the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, and Trump for attention during the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo’s daily press conferences usually air live on all the major cable networks and the coronavirus taskforce briefing helmed by Trump has become a chance for reporters to ask the president questions in front of a televised audience. What’s still unclear is how the coronavirus and the resulting state stay-at-home orders will affect Biden’s field organizing as November’s election heaves into view. The campaign is looking into coordinating virtual house parties as well.Usually, when a presidential candidate has vanquished all other rivals in their party he or she begins building a robust field program and conducts door-knocking to win over general election voters. But the pandemic means that part of campaigning is on hold and clouded with uncertainty.Instead of pounding pavements, campaign workers will have to leverage social media platforms to build that organization.The Biden campaign utilized phone banking, texting to voters, and its support on social media in winning the set of Super Tuesday states in March.“Our team has leveraged their expertise and talent to create powerful digital products that have harnessed millions of views, and as we continue our virtual campaign we will continue exploring creative and innovative formats while getting ready to grow,” a Biden spokesman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/932a59f304fcdd8f09fff98cdc1ea35832d65ca8/0_106_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa482ae489cd83fc78921bf26ca81d0b","title":"how has access to outside space impacted you during the lockdown","story":"We would like to know how your experience of lockdown in the UK has been shaped by your access to outdoor spaceWith lockdowns in place around the world, we know that the experience of staying indoors is very different depending on your access to outdoor space.We’d like to hear how your access to space has impacted you over the last three weeks.

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 201415 there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Is it harder to do in the case of a respiratory infection?Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by somebody they do not know, passing on the street. It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So the contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.What do the contact tracers do then?In the way it was operating in February, the tracer would call the contacts and ask them how close they had been to the person with symptoms and establish whether they were low risk or high risk. If the latter, they would be asked to isolate themselves for 14 days at home. The contact tracers would either call each day to check how they were or ask them to phone if they felt ill. If they developed symptoms, the tracers would start again, looking for their contacts in turn.Who does the contact tracing?It is organised by Public Health England, which had 290 staff doing it before community testing stopped. Public health in recent years has been the responsibility of local government, so any increase in contact tracers might come from local authorities.Which other countries have done this to scale?South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine. Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and in Europe, Germany also. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The World Health Organization says it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d8c9b58f1b0ab9202b8fb04e2b52af1b02cff98/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74e5b0f8a544cc531b00a5b114dea675","title":"coronavirus exerts heavy toll on filipino community in uk","story":"Almost two-thirds of 29 people believed to have died so far worked in the health sectorAs many as 29 people from the Philippines or with Filipino heritage – including a Grenfell Tower fire survivor – are believed to have died from Covid-19, as the pandemic exerts a heavy toll on a community that helps form the backbone to Britain’s healthcare sector.Some 18 of those who have lost their lives worked in the health sector, in roles including NHS nurses and porters, healthcare assistants and care home staff.A number of others are critically ill in intensive care.Among members of the Filipino community to have died is Virgilio “Larry” Castro, 63, who survived the Grenfell Tower fire less than three years ago, the  has learned. He died on 9 April.Castro, who had worked as a maintenance supervisor and at a bar, initially tried to fight the blaze and escaped in shorts and a T-shirt.He told the inquiry that he often thought about it and had suffered breathing problems since.Castro lived with his family on the 17th floor of the 24-storey tower for 26 years. He and his wife Lina, who died a decade ago, moved into the tower in April 1991 just after their daughter, Christabel, was born. She would go on to become a doctor, and was not at the tower on the night of the fire in June 2017.“I have watched my daughter grow up in that flat and have many fond memories of living there as a family,” he told the inquiry. He said that he had cried at a CCTV image, provided by police, of him leaving the tower in only a white T-shirt and yellow shorts. “I still find it difficult to look at that photograph.”The deaths of at least 21 Filipinos in the UK have been confirmed by the  where Covid-19 was contracted or where they had been suffering from symptoms prior to death. A further eight people are on a list which community leaders have been compiling, where Covid-19 is believed to have been a factor.Echoing concern elsewhere, there is anger that Filipino workers are among those bearing the brunt of a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers.There are about 200,000 Filipinos in the UK, and 18,500 of them in the NHS according to House of Commons library data from 2019, making them the most numerous nationality working in the health service after Britons and Indians.“It is breaking our hearts because we are talking about friends, family and close colleagues,” said Emily Barrameda of United Filipino Global (UFG), an organisation which represents Filipino overseas workers.“Like so many others, we don’t know what is happening and it’s hard in some cases not to believe that there is also some discrimination. In some hospitals where there is a British person who is positive with Covid-19 and a Filipino one … it seems that they will choose to prioritise the British one.”She referred to the death of a friend, Amor Padilla Gatinao, 50, who worked as a nurse at St Charles hospital, in west London, and died after falling ill on Mother’s Day. The nurse’s husband has reportedly told how an ambulance crew refused to take her to hospital nine days before she died of coronavirus, after he took her there himself by car.Other Filipinos who have died include John Alagos, 23, who become the third UK nurse to die after caring for coronavirus patients and is believed to have become the youngest British medic to succumb to the virus.His mother, Gina Gustilo, has spoken of how her son fell ill at Watford general hospital after a 12-hour shift.Other victims included Oscar King Jr and Elbert Rico, two porters at Oxford’s John Radcliffe hospital who died last weekend weekend. King Jr, who was described as a devoted father to his 10-year-old daughter, died on Saturday an hour after being brought to hospital after isolating at home with symptoms consistent with the virus. King Jr’s wife, Twilight, has been recovering after she was also taken to hospital.The partner of Leilani Medel, 41, a nurse in Bridgend, South Wales, who died on 10 April has also been treated after being brought to hospital with severe symptoms of the virus. Medel had worked in care homes and hospitals for more than 10 years.Among others were Linette Cruz, a senior head nurse at the Brynteg dental practice in Sketty, Swansea. The married mother of one was described by colleagues as a woman who brought “love, light and joy” to everyone she met.Cruz, who trained in the Philippines and came to the UK several years ago, died on 14 April after being treated for coronavirus in the intensive care unit at Morriston hospital in Swansea.Elvira Bucu, an NHS care worker and mother of three whose husband was also infected, died on 3 April. Leilani Dayrit, a clinical nurse sister at the hospital of St Cross in Rugby, died of suspected Covid-19 on 7 April.Members of the community who were not healthcare workers include Arnel Ganias, a courtesy driver at Heathrow airport, and Romeo Castillo Jr, 34. Known to friends as “Romy”, he died after contracting Covid-19 on a work trip to Mauritius, which he had won as a reward for his good work.Antonio Lagdameo, the Philippine ambassador to the UK, said: “We are are deeply saddened by reports of Filipino staff at the NHS who are either infected by Covid-19 or have succumbed to the disease. Our thoughts are with their loved ones.“Filipino health workers have served tirelessly and courageously at the frontlines of the war against this pandemic, and their contribution to the ongoing effort to save lives is nothing but immense.“The escalation of confirmed Covid-19 cases and Covid-19-related deaths point out the undeniable truth that this disease is an existential threat even to the most healthy and fit among us. I urge everyone to follow government advice, stay home and help protect the NHS heroes who put their lives on the line for all of us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dd5f2937537db577701b4929fe71afdfd28082a/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4cf64a821d68597b55a7ffbb6c59e199","title":"sick elderly pregnant the california renters being evicted even during the pandemic","story":"Despite new tenant protections, landlords are pushing out residents who can’t pay rent, making some homeless amid Covid-19When Covid-19 halted California’s economy, state officials promised to prevent evictions and defend tenants’ rights. But a dozen renters and their attorneys told the  that some landlords are proceeding to expel them from their homes despite the new regulations, indicating there are significant gaps in the protections.Those tenants include a pregnant woman, a cancer patient, an elderly woman, a mother of six, several newly unemployed low-wage workers and others vulnerable to Covid-19.Unable to pay rent in April, they have faced eviction notices on their doors, police officers attempting to remove them, pressure from property owners to immediately vacate and written demands from landlords spreading falsehoods about the emergency laws. Some tenants said they were moving out as a result, becoming homeless amid a pandemic.“We want to pay, but we don’t have the money,” said Virginia Gómez, a 51-year-old Los Angeles woman threatened with eviction from her home of three years. The property owner of her building last week repeatedly called police to try to remove her and her six children after she couldn’t immediately pay full rent due. “I told the police, ‘You guys are wearing masks and gloves, but you want to throw us out to the streets when the virus is out there?’ How are we supposed to ‘stay at home’ when they kick us out?”As California prepared to implement a shelter-in-place order to stop the spread of the virus, government leaders acknowledged that rent would be an urgent and vast problem. In March, the governor ordered a two-month statewide delay on imposing evictions for people who cannot pay rent due to Covid-19. The order prevents the enforcement of evictions until the end of May, but requires tenants to repay the full amount later. Some cities, like Oakland and LA, have adopted stronger protections.But the accounts and records from tenants across the state indicate those regulations ultimately fail to provide relief for those who are most in need, and are not being properly enforced. In some cases, the confusing patchwork of local ordinances has allowed landlords to continue targeting tenants in a state that had a severe housing crisis before coronavirus.Roughly 2.7 million people have filed unemployment claims in California since residents were ordered to stay home. Across the US, an estimated one-third of renters didn’t pay April rent.Though the courts are not currently processing evictions, some landlords are still starting the process, or unlawfully attempting to remove tenants. It’s difficult to know how many tenants across the state are threatened with eviction, but advocates in LA, the Bay Area, and parts of the Central Valley say they have anecdotally heard of a handful of cases in which owners have launched evictions. They are hearing more frequently about tenants facing misinformation and misleading threats from landlords.Krystal McMorris, 29, is pregnant and currently fighting to keep her apartment in Alameda, an island across the bay from San Francisco: “I don’t have any options. I have to stay here. I have to fight. If not, I will be homeless and pregnant. I already fear this stress is going to cause me to lose my baby.”McMorris worked for six years for FPI Management, a real estate corporation, as an on-site property manager, a job which included her apartment. After the pandemic was declared last month, FPI terminated her position and told her she had 30 days to move out, despite the eviction moratorium and regional shelter-in-place orders. When McMorris asked the company to allow her to stay until the Covid-19 emergency had passed, telling her boss she was pregnant, the company responded that she “does not have rights” and that it could have forced her out in three days, but instead gave her until 17 April.“If she fails to vacate by that deadline, we will take immediate legal action to regain possession of the unit as soon as legally possible,” Brandi Hutchinson, FPI senior director, wrote to McMorris’s attorney, adding that she would now owe $3,030 a month.Despite her fears of contracting Covid-19, McMorris went to multiple open houses around the Bay Area last weekend in hopes of finding a new apartment, exposing herself to strangers, but found nothing affordable or livable. “There’s no housing, no employment. Everyday I’m afraid. It’s been dreadful, scary, stressful, frustrating.”McMorris, who lost her health insurance and has been unable to go to the doctor, said she wants to leave her apartment, but has nowhere to go. “People are dying left and right. I was just asking that they at least give me more time.”FPI’s chief operating officer, Dave Divine, did not respond to specific questions about how the company plans to “regain possession” of her apartment, but said in an email that “FPI is compassionate to Ms McMorris’ situation” and has not forced her to pay rent . “FPI’s actions have been and shall remain consistent with all applicable laws.”Gómez, the mother of six, has lived with her family for three years in the Courtyard Motel in Downey, an LA suburb. Although it’s a motel, she and other tenants live there full-time and, according to attorneys, are protected under anti-eviction laws, including the new Covid-19 regulations. But after the father of her children lost most of his income at a restaurant due to Covid-19, the family ran out of money to pay rent. She said she pleaded with the motel manager, saying she would pay everything she had as soon as possible.Managers responded by calling the Downey police department to remove her, and officers showed up to her door, telling her she had to leave. Because she happened to be on the phone at the time with Monica Arellano, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of LA, the lawyer was able to talk to the officers and explain the law. Police eventually left, but the motel called the department again multiple times that day, requiring her to repeatedly explain her rights to new officers.She still paid the minimal cash they could, $370, after getting a check, leaving her with little money for other basic necessities. She said the managers continue to threaten her. “Anytime I leave my room, I fear they are going to call the cops on my kids, and I’ll come back and they’ll be kicked out,” said Gómez, who has lupus, a long-term autoimmune disease that puts her at higher risk of Covid-19 complications. “I keep telling them whatever money we have we’ll give it to them.”The Downey police department did not respond to inquiries. Reached by phone, Rushabh Bhakta, a representative with the motel, said his staff made a payment arrangement with Gómez after calling police.Sonia Aguilar, 43, who is recovering from breast cancer, has faced threats from her LA landlord, who has said he wants her family out by the end of April. Earlier in the year, Aguilar, her husband and three children had planned to move, but once the pandemic hit, it became impossible and dangerous for her: “I have underlying health issues and I only go out for food and medicine. I’m not in any condition to rent a U-Haul. It’s scary.”But the landlord, Ezequiel Navar, won’t stop calling them, she said: “The stress is making me more ill.”Some tenants are fighting hard to assert their rights in the face of eviction threats.“I knew it wasn’t an obligation to pay, and that it was better to keep that money for food and emergencies,” said Michelle Johnson, a 28-year-old LA resident recently furloughed from her job at a coffee company. After she told her property manager she couldn’t pay, the manager said she was required to submit three pay stubs, proof of unemployment and two bank statements, and then sign a payment plan. None of this is required by law. The manager then taped an eviction notice on her door, a “three-day notice” to pay or leave, the first step of an eviction lawsuit.“It was not only an intimidation tactic for me, but it was also for other tenants to see,” said Johnson, whose apartment is near the front door of the building. “Unfortunately for y’all, you picked the wrong informed tenant. I know this is illegal.”It was still emotional for Johnson, who experienced homelessness as a child. But she responded with an email reminding the manager of her rights, and then filed a complaint with the city. “The city isn’t doing enough to make sure landlords are doing their job.” (LA’s housing department did not respond to a request for comment.)Shirin Bina, 36, said she “completely fell apart” and cried for days after receiving a similar three-day eviction notice on her door in Oakland. “It just seemed like she had absolutely no regard for me as a human being,” Bina said of her landlord, Debra Reese. “She broke the ‘shelter in place’ to put that on my door.”Bina told Reese she couldn’t pay after losing a job as a bookkeeper and other work. She reminded her landlord of Oakland’s ordinance. Reese responded: “You failed to provide documentation and you failed to pay your rent therefore this method will be utilized.”Bina said she has struggled at times to understand her rights, adding, “If there’s such severe repercussions for a tenant not paying rent, there should be severe repercussions for a landlord abusing the law at this point.”Reese did not respond to inquiries.Chris Tyler’s landlord in LA asked that he sign an agreement saying he would immediately report his “stimulus payments, unemployment benefits, payments related to paid family leave, disability insurance payments and Covid-19 related loans” so the owner can ‘“accelerate amounts due”. Tyler, who works with the LA Tenants Union and lost his job at a bar, said he knew not to agree to the contract, but worries about others: “When you’re in a precarious situation, and you don’t know your rights, you obviously feel compelled to sign.”The LA Tenants Union has urged people to withhold rent and has called for lawmakers to freeze rent and mortgage payments during the crisis. If the state passed a rent forgiveness law, it would ensure tenants avoid insurmountable debts. In the meantime, advocates said, cities should proactively enforce the protections in place and hold landlords accountable when they violate renters’ rights.The tenants union is also assisting 70-year-old Pamela Fairbanks. She paid her rent, but her landlord, Steve Kaali, showed up at her door this week with an eviction notice, alleging she had too many cats. Fairbanks, who has lived in her apartment for 25 years, said she has long owned three cats. She said she has also been in quarantine for weeks while recovering from bacterial pneumonia: “I panicked. I was shaking. I could barely breathe through the tears.” Reached by phone, Kaali said the cats were an ongoing issue because they go in and out of the apartment, and his eviction notice was meant to be a “scare tactic” to get her to install a window screen: “I’m not taking her to court knowing I’m not going to win.”He added that he hadn’t tried to remove her from her rent-controlled apartment and bring in a higher-paying tenant: “I could’ve been a slumlord scumbag who kicks everyone out. I did not.”Jonathan Cañez and Tamiaya Moore, roommates who live in Bakersfield in the Central Valley, both lost their longtime jobs at a local hotel due to Covid-19. When they told their landlord they couldn’t pay rent, the manager told them they would owe the full amount and should move out if they can’t afford it.“We decided it’s better to just cut our losses,” said Cañez, 25, who is moving in with his brother. They didn’t know how they would ever be able to pay back the rent: “I’ve worked so hard to have this place to call my own, a safe space. To have that shift away from me has been very hard and humiliating.”Moore, 26, is going to sleep on an air mattress at a friend’s house for now. She’s been applying to jobs at grocery stores, but is also afraid of working there due to her asthma and the reality that essential workers are dying on the job. “I’m emotional because I was just getting my life together. Now it’s going to be rough for awhile.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f076725d5c5fb6452ffc9185218e32b75b3ff0a1/178_146_3972_2383/master/3972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b639b58c4d92aa601025cead0f62e25b","title":"uk to start coronavirus contact tracing again","story":"Matt Hancock says government to rebuild teams amid criticism it stopped strategy too earlyBritain is to restart tracing the contacts of people who have had coronavirus symptoms, the health secretary has said, reverting to a policy recommended by the World Health Organization but abandoned by the UK as the numbers of cases and deaths began to rise in early March.Matt Hancock told the health select committee on Friday that police, fire, prison and Department of Work and Pensions staff would now be eligible for coronavirus testing, amid growing concerns that the country will miss its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.A former director of the WHO told the hearing that contact tracing, testing and isolation could have continued for longer across the UK and would have enabled the government to lock down London while leaving other areas of the country with fewer restrictions.Prof Anthony Costello, the head of the Institute for Global Health at University College London, pointed out that Yorkshire had fewer than 10 cases identified in 300,000-400,000 people around the time that contact tracing and community testing were halted and, as such, could have avoided a complete lockdown.Critics have said the UK was too quick to stop the universal testing of people with symptoms, and following up with their recent contacts, who could then be asked to self-isolate.The WHO has repeatedly urged governments to pursue the strategy, which has been key to stopping epidemics around the world in modern times. “Tracing every contact must be the backbone of the response in every country,” the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in March.Other countries such as Singapore and South Korea, have successfully used it to contain their outbreaks, while Germany, which has a far lower case and death rate than the UK, has also worked hard on contact tracing.But on 12 March, Boris Johnson announced that the UK epidemic could no longer be contained that way. Testing was then restricted to those who were admitted to hospital, and contact tracing was stopped. The numbers of cases and deaths in the UK soared and a lockdown was imposed on 23 March.Hancock said on Friday that the government would rebuild the teams of contact tracers as part of a renewed testing and tracing strategy.His predecessor Jeremy Hunt, who is chair of the health select committee of MPs where Hancock was giving evidence, pointed out that South Korea had up to 1,000 contact tracers. “Public Health England had 290 people doing this at their peak, but they now say it has been wound down. Are we going to build it up again?” he asked.Hancock said yes and that contact tracing teams would be part of a strategy that included the use of a phone app to identify recent contacts and warn them that they might need to self-isolate.“The app is itself a contact tracing app, that is the point of it, to be able to assist iniduals to do contact tracing themselves by notifying people who they have been in close contact with when they have downloaded the app. And then of course link that to testing, so people can get the tests.”Testing, tracing and isolating the contacts of people with Covid-19 is expected to be a key part of the exit strategy for every country that has imposed a lockdown, as a way to keep control of the epidemic. Asked if he accepted that comprehensive contact tracing would need to be in place to lift the UK lockdown, Hancock said the government was working “incredibly hard” on the WHO-recommended strategy.“We do need to have comprehensive test, track and trace in place as soon as possible,” he said. “And we need to get the technology right, we need to have the people, and we’re building that resource, and obviously we need to have the testing and we’re ramping that up as well. So we do need to have all three of those in place and we’re working incredibly hard to make sure that we are.”Earlier, Costello said the nationwide lockdown could have been avoided, with only the capital facing severe restrictions.He said the example of 10 identified cases in 300,000-400,000 people in Yorkshire meant that in such areas people could have continued to go about their lives and work while maintaining physical distancing.Hancock admitted the government had discussed it. “We did consider having a London-specific lockdown and decided it was better to do it across the country as a whole.”This was because people would be travelling between London and other parts of the UK and, he said, it was striking how the country had come together to observe the restrictions. “To separate one part of the country from another has downsides in terms of the national unity we have seen in the response.”Johnson’s spokesman later declined to say anything beyond Hancock’s words on the possible scale of testing needed to implement a full regime of contact tracing.He also declined to comment on why the UK did not isolate or trace people arriving in the country from overseas, while adding that this policy could potentially change in the future: “We’ve always said that we don’t rule out taking steps if that’s what the science advises.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: CollinsSome 5,000 Irish citizens have returned to Ireland over the last month as the global coronavirus pandemic took hold. Over the Easter weekend alone, citizens were repatriated from Vietnam, Cambodia, New Zealand and South Africa. A further 1,000 citizens have conveyed an interest in returning home, the Government has revealed. Meanwhile, more than 45,000 employers are now registered with the temporary wage subsidy scheme set up to keep workers in employment during the pandemic and associated restrictions on movement and commerce. To date €267 million has been drawn down from the scheme. Further refunds generated by the Revenue Commissioners will be in people’s bank accounts next week, the assistant general secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach Liz Canavan has told a daily briefing on Friday. The Government is increasing the amount it will pay under the coronavirus wage subsidy scheme in a bid to keep more part-time workers on the payroll.The subsidy, introduced as an emergency measure last month, will be increased from 70 per cent to 85 per cent for employees who earn less than €24,400 per year.Under the changes, the scheme will also be extended to higher-paid workers – those earning over €76,000 – in a bid to reduce the number of people being laid off. The move comes after employers said that some of their part-time and low-paid staff were not working because they could earn more from the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.Bogus emailsThe public has been advised of a bogus email in circulation at present purporting to be from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection seeking a refund in unemployment payments made to customers from a nominated bank account. The department said the emails usually come from gmail or hotmail accounts, neither of which the department uses. Drivers’ licence and learner permits due to expire by June 30th have been extended for a further four months. The same extensions will apply to certificates of competency received on passing a driving test, driver theory test certificates, motorcycle and basic training certificates. It will also apply to national car tests (NCTs) due to expire by June 30th and the commercial vehicle roadworthiness tests. Ms Cavanan said this will ensure that people will not lose out as a result of the temporary closure of the Road Safety Authority facilities and “will, in particular, help to keep vital supply chain workers on our roads”. The Department of Transport is monitoring a dispute between P\u0026ampO Ferries and Liverpool and Peel ports over the non-payment of fees by the company. As a result the Norbay, one of three P\u0026ampO vessels on the Dublin-Liverpool route, was impounded at Liverpool Port as it was due to sail to Dublin. Ms Canavan said that though it was fundamentally a contractual dispute, it did have implications for the supply chain in Ireland. She said P\u0026ampO ferries accounts for less than 20 per cent of the freight between Britain and Ireland. She said the other ferry operators will be able to take up the slack and the supply chain is unlikely to be affected. Farmer paymentsGlas payments, the green low-carbon scheme for farmers, will be brought forward by a month and €26 million will start issuing to 42,300 farmers early next week. She said the payment should “significantly increase the cash flow on Irish farms during these challenging times”. A subsidy of €4 million has been announced to support audiovisual production companies and creative talent indeveloping a strong slate of projects. The money will be assigned to production companies, screenwriters and others in TV and animation. Ms Canavan conc luded by stating that the Irish public must “keep it up” when it comes to retaining social distancing. “We need to keep going to protect ourselves, our families and our community,” she said.

This is a St Patrick’s Day like no other. A day that none of us will ever forget.”It may seem like a lifetime ago but it has been one month since Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told us in a St Patrick’s Day address to “come together as a nation by staying apart from each other”.The biggest social experiment ever attempted in this country was, as everyone foresaw, rolled over after a two-week period. After some delay, the Taoiseach’s gently proffered directions were given teeth through the enactment of draconian laws requiring citizens to have a “reasonable excuse” for being outside.In his March 17th address to the television cameras, Varadkar warned: “We cannot stop this virus but working together we can slow it in its tracks and push it back.”A month on, this central objective has been largely achieved. There have been bumps on the way, and performance in different areas has varied, but much of the health service has prepared well, while the blow to the economy and to our inidual livelihoods has been cushioned for now.At the time the Taoiseach spoke, Ireland had 292 Covid-19 cases and two deaths now we’ve had some 13,000 people diagnosed with the illness and more than 450 have died. Despite this upward trajectory, the die was already cast at the time of Varadkar’s address to the nation. The virus was circulating and infecting people rapidly, and the challenge was always going to be to limit its growth first.Mass social distancingThis has been achieved in large measure a daily growth rate of more than 33 per cent has been cut to about 6 per cent. Over the space of a month, the number of people contracting the disease from an infected person has dropped from an average of 20 to about three, as mass social distancing has taken effect.Beyond the numbers, however, we have endured those “difficult days” envisaged by the Taoiseach as thousands have fallen ill and hundreds have died.The expected frontline of the battle with coronavirus has shifted too. Despite difficulties with personal protective equipment, hospitals have coped well with the expected surge of patients by clearing out other business more effectively than expected and by ramping up capacity. The numbers of infected people in intensive care units (ICU) are stable and even falling slightly this week.Sadly, nursing homes and other residential centres have fared less well. The warning signs were there from an early stage, including a lack of specific guidelines, a lack of engagement with the sector and a lack of transparency.Frail exposedToday, the virus is present in hundreds of care homes, which account for more than half of all deaths. An inquiry into how so many mostly elderly and frail residents, as well as poorly protected staff, were left exposed is inevitable at some point in the future.May 5th is the new date for when the restrictions may end, but only a wild optimist believes a blanket departure from the measures is likely then.Ireland is, at least, near the top of the graph, probably. Having endured the Taoiseach’s “calm before the storm” and coped with the surge, we can soon look forward to cases and deaths beginning to fall.The problem is that there is no clear way out of this. While everything in our lives has changed, in terms of the challenge we still face, nothing has changed.Other countries may be easing their restrictions at present, but these moves are tentative. The science tells us the virus can and will return if social distancing ends. And if distancing stays, our lives stay altered immeasurably, at least until a vaccine is developed.In another demonstration of the challenge posed by this disease, a study published on Thursday in Nature found people were most infectious in the days before they showed symptoms. The only way to cope with it for now will be to build the testing and contact-tracing system we have so far failed to properly develop.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231794.1587145085!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"up to 4 000 new babies to be registered electronically for first time","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAs a result of Covid-19 restrictions, the Department of Social Protection estimates that there may be up to 4,000 births not yet registered.

And Child Benefit payments do not commence until after a birth is registered.The new arrangements put in place by the General Register Office have taken into account the HSE and WHO guidelines on social distancing, the Department of Social Protection said.Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty said many parents have “consciously decided not to register the birth of their new arrival to their families during the pandemic because of the social distancing requirements”.“That is why my department has worked to put an alternative channel into place so that all families can register their new-borns easily and avail of their child benefit entitlements,” she said, urging all parents of new babies to consider using the new arrangements.Registrar General, TJ Fleming, said the social distancing requirements currently in place as a result of the pandemic “highlight the usefulness of the electronic registration process”.The process will be kept under review to ensure it is as “simple and straightforward as possible”, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Testing to be expanded with 100,000 carried out every week for at least next six monthsKeelings says all 189 Bulgarians were medically screened before travellingGraduates say they don\u0026rsquot underestimate the challenge ahead in light of Covid-19Lawyers to argue Thomas Martens should be let out on bond due to Covid-19 dangerIdeally, family member should be permitted stay with dying relative, charity saysFather-to-be Glen Osborne (20) died from stab wounds last WednesdayAstrophysicist uses his mathmatical models to model numbers and trends from virusCovid-19 has delayed registration of births due to social distancing restrictionsLockdown enabling people to engage with \u0026lsquocalm and quiet\u0026rsquo natural worldNUJ proposes symbolic virtual commemoration \u0026lsquoin solidarity and remembrance\u0026rsquoRetired Irish doctor, recovered from Covid-19, says local airlines won\u0026rsquot take tourists\u0026lsquoPeople are setting fires in rural areas and letting them run away up the mountains\u0026rsquoVaradkar makes announcement at virtual graduation ceremony for 197 new doctors at University College Cork\u0026lsquoRyanair and Dublin Airport can confirm that all regulations were adhered to\u0026rsquo - statementNational emergency team will review measures taken to tackle nursing home outbreaks at Friday meetingAccused agrees to abide by strict bail conditions including residing at home in CorkLoading bays and parking spaces will be removed to provide additional space for pedestriansHospital in Dublin\u0026rsquos Phoenix Park said deaths had been recorded since April 2ndSeverely ill passenger met by ambulance and taken to hospitalFigures come after confirmation deaths at least one third higher than reported in NIStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231648.1587135362!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bulgarian fruit pickers flown into dublin all screened by doctors says keelings","story":"Dr Tony Holohan has said that the chartering of flights to bring workers into the country is not consistent with the public health advice, when asked about the KeelingsRyanair controversy.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Almost 200 Bulgarian fruit pickers flown into Dublin this week were all screened by doctors before they travelled, their employer has said. Following an outpouring of concern in the context of Covid-19, Keelings strawberry producer said the 189 seasonal workers also had their temperature checked before entry. “Ryanair and Dublin Airport can confirm that all regulations were adhered to. They were taken straight to their housing. In accordance with HSE guidelines, they cannot work for 14 days after their arrival and their movements are restricted,” it said in a statement issued as an attempt to quell mounting concerns over the arrival of a relatively large number of people into the country. The workers flew on a charter Ryanair flight from Sofia to Dublin on Monday. Keelings employs about 900 temporary horticulture workers during the main fruit and vegetable season from April to October - about 70 per cent return each year. Anxiety“We will take care of these colleagues as we take care of all of our people, permanent or temporary,” the company said. “They will be subject to further medical screening before they start work at Keelings. We will continue to consult with the HSE and other appropriate agencies to ensure both our staff and the communities they live in remain safe.”The arrival of the workers in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic and stringent public movement restrictions has caused some anxiety in the area in which many of them are living. The issue prompted Fianna Fáil to call for clarity as regards the movement of people through airports, while People Before Profit said formal inspections were required “to insure the workers are housed and working in conditions which will allow for social distancing and isolation if needed”.Social Democrats TD Cian O’Callaghan said urgent clarity is required “about quarantine measures for seasonal workers who are arriving in Ireland”.No distancing Earlier in the week, a letter addressed to a Meath councillor, purporting to be from a Ryanair employee, said the chartered flight from Sofia on Monday had 189 passengers. “There was no social distancing on board, putting all the cabin crew at risk, there was also 200 bags in the hold of the aircraft putting the ground handling agents at risk,” the letter claimed. At Dublin Airport, passenger traffic is down by 99 per cent. A spokesman for DAA, which runs the airport, said on Wednesday fewer than 280 passengers were due to land. That figure compares to about 50,000 at this time of the year in normal circumstances.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw  The Dublin City Council will carry out works in areas across the city next week, in order to give more space to pedestrians and enable social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.In a letter to elected members of the council, chief executive Owen Keegan provided an update on measures being taken to tackle the spread of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, in the local authority area.One of the measures announced is the implementation of “emergency Covid-19 social distancing measures” in Ranelagh, Rathmines, Stoneybatter, Dorset Street and Capel Street from Monday, April 20th.The works will involve removing loading bays and parking spaces to provide additional space for pedestrians where there is evidence of footpath congestion.Orcas and bollards will be installed to protect these spaces as well as existing cycle tracks from incursions from vehicles. A counter flow cycle lane will also be installed on Nassau Street.The decision to implement these measures comes following calls from lobby groups and local politicians to allocate additional space to pedestrians and cyclists during the pandemic, following examples from other European cities.Dublin Commuter Coalition, the lobby group, said it was important these measures were introduced to ensure the safety of pedestrians not just due to social distancing measures, but also to reduce road traffic collisions.Kevin Carter, chairman of the coalition, the news that they will be implemented is “hugely welcome”.“However, we recognise that Dublin is a large city and the examples given that will receive this treatment is few and far between. We would like to see it aggressively deployed across the city,” he added.Kevin Baker, chairman of the Dublin Cycling Campaign, which lobbies for safer cycling infrastructure, said this step is important for essential workers.Speaking about the cycle lane on Nassau Street, he said: “So many essential workers, like healthcare staff, have swapped to cycling to work because they’re trying to avoid using public transport.“We should be doing all we can to make it easier for them and to ensure their safety.”Donna Cooney, Green Party councillor said she is “delighted” the council is being so proactive.“I’m hoping they’re going to extend it out. There are particular roads I’d like to see it happen in as well, like Collins Avenue and East Wall Road,” Ms Cooney said.“While they’re temporary measures, hopefully people will see the benefits of this and they will be retained after the crisis. That is what tends to happen internationally.”In his letter, Mr Keegan also told members that parks will remain open “despite problems in terms of compliance with social distancing”.He added: “Park staff, with the support of An Garda Siochána, are intervening in an attempt to address problems as they arise.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231857.1587150446!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus new doctors welcome taoiseach s pledge on internships","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmma O’Riordan: ‘I have mixed emotions - it would be difficult for me to say to you that I am totally comfortable.’ Photograph: Emma O’RiordanIt was, to paraphrase, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, a graduation ceremony like no other but then for the 197 students graduating in medicine at UCC today, they are living in such unusual times that nothing should prove surprising.For both Emma O’Riordan (24) from Blackrock and Patrick Hogan (23) from Douglas, the virtual graduation ceremony went surprisingly well with both highly appreciative of the fact that the Taoiseach addressed them by video link.And after congratulating both Irish and foreign students on their graduation, Mr Varadkar, himself a medical doctor, pledged every medical graduate in Ireland this year would be offered an internship in the Irish health system.The catch, if that’s the word, is that everyone coming into the Irish health system will be recruited to help combat the Covid-19 pandemic, which in addition to the population at large, has also hit health care professionals.For Emma, whose father is a surgeon and whose mother is a GP, the challenge over the coming weeks and months as an intern is daunting and she candidly admits that she has mixed emotions about what lies ahead.“I suppose for us as Irish students, we were kind of expected to get a job anyway but whereas the Taoiseach’s pledge has been a massive help is that a lot of our friends are from New Zealand, Canada, Australia and Malaysia.“All these people wanted to stay in Ireland so the fact that the government has made more intern jobs available, they are now all staying which means we will have more doctors in the Irish health system which is good,” she said.Ms O’Riordan said moving from academia to a front line hospital situation in the midst of the greatest health challenge facing the country in arguably 100 years is proving a daunting prospect.Uncharted territory“I have mixed emotions - it would be difficult for me to say to you that I am totally comfortable about it because it is quite uncharted territory but there are pros and cons to everything and this is no different“One the one hand for us as junior doctors starting out, it’s going to be quite nerve racking, we’re not going to know what to do, we obviously have seen Covid-19 and it’s quite new to us.“But on the other hand it’s an incredible learning opportunity for us - we are going be thrown in at the deep end and we are going to learn so much in such a short space of time so it will be fantastic for us.“As well as that, we have been supported so well by UCC Medical School and the staff at all the Cork hospitals so even though I feel a little bit nervous we know are going into an environment where people are going to look out for us.“So we’re not terrified at the prospect - we’re looking forward to getting started because we are the same as everyone else sitting at home watching it on TV and wanting to help so it will be great to get started and give a hand.”Nature of the timesFor Patrick Hogan, both of whose parents are doctors working occupational health, the offer of an internship in the Irish system is again to be welcomed even though he expects it to be a baptism of fire in the fight against Covid-19.“We are all incredibly excited to get going but at the same time there is a fear that you are entering the unknown and those stories of health care workers becoming ill and in some cases, dying is quite shocking.“But at the same time, it’s almost what we signed up for in a way - there are going to be medical crises and epidemics where, at the end of the day, your job is to help people to stay healthy so this is just a part of that.“I know I will take every precaution I can to stay healthy and we’ve had brilliant training over the years that will protect us and I have full faith in the HSE and the government they will protect us health care staff in every way they can.“I suppose there is a feeling that we are getting called to the front line and literally that’s what people are saying, we are getting called to the front line and it almost sounds like a wartime calling which is frightening.But that’s the nature of the times we are in. It is a bit of a daunting call but we just have to have full faith in ourselves and what we can do and trust that we can contribute in whatever way we can.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231715.1587140270!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lyra mckee anniversary it has been the most horrific and surreal year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJournalist and author Lyra McKee was shot dead  during riots in the Creggan area of Derry. Photogrpah: Jess LoweBells will ring out in the Creggan in Derry on Saturday to mark the first anniversary of the murder of 29-year-old Belfast journalist Lyra McKee.Ms McKee was shot dead on April 18th last year as she was observing rioting in the city. The New IRA admitted the murder.A special Mass is to be offered in St Mary’s Chapel in Creggan by the parish priest who anointed her, Fr Joe Gormley. The Mass, which also will be in memory of Ms McKee’s mother, Joan Lawrie, who died last month, will be held at 6.30pm while the bells will ring at 8.30pm. The Mass can be viewed via the church’s webcam. Bells also will be rung in her native city of Belfast on Saturday to mark the anniversary.Fr Gormley said it was important that Ms McKee be remembered. “It is also important that Lyra does not become another statistic of the Troubles,” he said.“The effects of every killing of the Troubles continue on and on,” he said. “I am thinking how the death of her mother highlights the fact that people do carry pain to their graves, and it does hasten people going to their graves as well.” Ms McKee’s partner, Sara Canning, said on Friday she still hoped there would be justice. She described the past 12 months as the “most horrific and surreal year”.“I miss my life with her. If I could go back to this time last year I’d do things differently,” she told BBC Radio Foyle. “I wish we stayed in bed that night and just read books and talked nonsense to each other. I really hope we get justice. I don’t want to give up hope,” Ms Canning added.On Saturday at 11am, National Union of Journalist (NUJ) members will join “in solidarity and remembrance” to mark the first anniversary of the murder. The NUJ is to celebrate Ms McKee’s life and legacy and has encouraged members and friends of Ms McKee to take part in a symbolic virtual commemoration.The union has asked that social media be used “to highlight the shared values which Lyra embraced under the banner #WeStandWithLyra”.The NUJ has also asked media workers to share examples of Ms McKee’s journalism, tributes, memories and pictures on Saturday morning.Community helpThis week, the PSNI detective leading the murder investigation wrote to residents in the Creggan asking for community help in convicting her killers.Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy said: “Lyra’s murder was not committed in isolation, nor did it involve only one person. The events that led up to Lyra being shot, and the events afterwards, are equally important. I am asking the community to reach into its conscience and tell us what it knows.”Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland director Patrick Corrigan said Ms McKee’s murder was a “reminder of the risks that reporters face every day around the world, including here in Northern Ireland”.He said: “Northern Ireland continues to be the most dangerous part of the UK to be a journalist, threatening press freedom daily. In the year since Lyra’s death, reporters have continued to receive threats of violence and death on a regular basis.”Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken in marking the anniversary said that a truly peaceful society can emerge in Northern Ireland only when all communities give total support to the police and help them to put criminal gangs out of business.“The people responsible for Lyra McKee’s murder – like their criminal counterparts elsewhere in Northern Ireland – seek to invoke a political cause to try to give a veneer of respectability to their criminal activities,” he said.

However, due to Covid-19 and for concern of our staff, guests\u0026nbspand delivery folks, we’ll be closed until further notice. Please note we do this with heavy hearts.“After 87 years this is the hardest thing we have to do. We’re going to miss all of you terribly. If you’d like to leave a message please press 6 and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can. Thank you, and stay safe.”The recorded message from the owner of Martin’s Tavern is one of thousands of similar ones around the US as the restaurant industry reels from the coronavirus pandemic.Martin’s is one of Washington’s most famous eateries.Founded in 1933 at the end of prohibition, it has been owned by four generations of Billy Martins. Part-restaurant, part-watering hole, the small corner property in Georgetown exudes charm and history. \u0026nbspOld baseball photos adorn the bar, a nod to the founder’s first career as a major league baseball player. The Guinness is popular and plentiful, signalling the family’s Irish roots.It has also had a front-row seat on history. John F Kennedy proposed to Jackie Bouvier in Booth Three near the window. Jack had been a brunch regular and the couple settled two blocks away in Georgetown. Every American president from Harry Truman to George W Bush came to dine. Richard Nixon was a regular when he was in Congress. Ted Kennedy often drank in the back room known as the Dugout, to avoid the prying eyes of the press and the public.While Donald Trump has yet to visit, in recent years Irish politicians passing through Washington have enjoyed a meal.Good to goA photograph of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is one of many displayed on the window. Like his predecessor, Enda Kenny, and other recent taoisigh, he visited Martin’s during the annual St Patrick’s Day visit when schedules would allow.Like countless establishments across the country, the doors of Martin’s have been closed since coronavirus hit. Martin’s initially offered a takeout service when Washington’s mayor announced the closure of non-essential businesses in mid-March, explains general manager Luis Valle. On St Patrick’s Day, Martin’s emailed regulars offering corned beef and cabbage and shepherd’s pie for kerb-side delivery and pick-up. Since then, the restaurant has closed for already-scheduled construction work. It intends to resume takeout and delivery service as soon as possible, says Valle, who has worked for Martin’s for 12 years. “Crab cakes, steaks, chicken parmigiana – we’ll be preparing it all,” he says. They are also exploring the idea of hiring Martin’s waiting staff as drivers, instead of using food delivery services such as Uber Eats and DoorDash. Most of the staff have been temporarily laid-off. “I have never experienced anything like this,” says Valle. “It seemed to come out of the blue, and then became more and more serious. We’ll be back though.”Martin’s travails are replicated across Washington DC, where wining and dining is a way of life. On 14th street, usually a hive of activity in the evenings, virtually all shops and restaurants are closed. Barcelona, a buzzing tapas bar, typically teeming with customers, is offering a takeout menu. World Central KitchenUpmarket restaurants such as Cafe Milano, where Congress members and White House officials including Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner have been spotted in recent months, have closed.Activity has ground to a halt at iconic establishments such as the Willard Hotel across from the White House. A few blocks east, the Trump Hotel has closed its public bars and restaurants. The sale of the hotel’s lease – announced by the Trump Organisation in October – has been put on hold.José Andrés, one of the country’s best-known chefs, who owns more than half a dozen restaurants around the DC area, has directed his energy into feeding the US’s poor during the pandemic.His World Central Kitchen charity was set up to help people in need of food in the wake of natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes. Now the Spanish-American chef is helping the needy in his adopted home.His non-profit has moved into the Washington Nationals’ baseball park in the city from where staff are preparing and distributing thousands of meals to help the city’s poorest and homeless residents.With Washington’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, announcing this week that the lockdown has been extended until May 15th, the new reality is likely to continue for some time to come.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Protests break out in India as migrant workers stranded and starving far from homeNHS medics told to reuse PPE and wear aprons if gowns not available as stocks fallCoronavirus latest news: Government announces vaccine taskforce as it aims \u0026#39to beat invisible killer\u0026#39Comment: The exit strategy is clear.

There are now more people who have recovered than those who are newly infected,” Mr Spahn told a press conference in Berlin. Angela Merkel this week identified the reproduction factor as a key measurement of when lockdown measures can be lifted. German government scientists have declared lowering it to under 1 as a major target in bringing the outbreak under control.“The strategy we have pursued so far is showing success,” said Prof Lothar Wieler, head of the government-funded Robert Koch Institute (RKI), which is overseeing Germany’s response to the virus. “The positive trend is that the increase in the number of cases has slowed significantly. Not everyone with the virus is infecting another person.”But Prof Wieler warned it remains to be seen whether the reduction will be sustainable. “We survived the first wave well, but we mustn’t overplay this achievement,” he said.“The goal has not yet been reached because the number is not yet permanent. The goal now is therefore not to reduce the number further, but to keep it stable below 1. We must not overlook the fact that this has cost us enormous effort.”Germany has carried out more testing for the virus than anywhere else in Europe, with more than 1.73m tests so far.It already had more intensive care beds than any other European country at the start of the crisis, with 29,000, but has since increased the number to 40,000.Following the fall in infections, hospitals will begin to return to a normal footing and non-emergency surgery will be resumed from next month, Mr Spahn announced. “Four weeks ago, we told those who had already faced long waits for back or hip surgery that their operations would have to be postponed. That caused pressure and a fair bit of emotional and physical suffering,” he said.“That’s why I think it’s important, as we gradually return to a new normal in public life, that we will find a new balance in the hospitals from the beginning of May.”Around a quarter of intensive care beds will be kept free for coronavirus patients, Mr Spahn said.Six out of seven patients experienced mild courses of the virus and could be safely treated as outpatients, allowing hospitals to focus on the most serious cases.The announcement comes as Germany prepares to begin gradually lifting lockdown measures, with many shops due to reopen from Monday. But Mrs Merkel this week used the reproduction factor to explain how fragile the situation remains, and that Germany\u0027s health system could quickly be overwhelmed by a rise in infections.“If it reaches 1.1, our health system would reach crisis point in October,” she told a press conference on Wednesday, when the R0 was at around 1. “At 1.2, we would reach the limit as soon as July. With 1.3, we would already be at limit by the end of June.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"human trials coronavirus vaccine set begin uk next week","story":"Human trials for a coronavirus vaccine are set to begin next week, as the government launches a taskforce to ramp up efforts to tackle the pandemic.Scientists at the University of Oxford have been working on a vaccine to prevent people from catching Covid-19, which they plan to test on the first UK volunteers within the next seven days.Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology who is leading the team, said it could be ready to use on the general public by the autumn, with at least a million doses on standby to be rolled out in September.It comes as Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, revealed that more than 5,500 people have been enrolled in UK clinical trials to establish whether existing medicines can help treat Covid-19 patients.He said that developing a vaccine was a difficult, complicated process which would take many months, and there was a lot to do before the UK would be able to safely deliver one to the population.Coronavirus survivors are now also being asked to donate blood plasma in the hope that transfusions will eventually help those fighting the disease.The NHS Blood and Transplant Service is appealing to those who are recovering from Covid-19 to give convalescent plasma which contains antibodies that stop the virus growing.Donors must have tested positive for the illness either at home or in hospital, but should now be three to four weeks into their recovery - ideally 29 days.The government yesterday launched a taskforce designed to rapidly develop a coronavirus vaccine, as well as scale up manufacturing so it can be quickly produced and delivered in mass quantities.It will be led by Sir Patrick Vallance and Professor Jonathan van Tam, the deputy chief medical officer, and members will include AstraZeneca and the Wellcome Trust.The government has also earmarked £14m to plough into 21 coronavirus research projects.One is being led by scientists at the University of Oxford, who plan to trial an antimalarial drug with anti-inflammatory properties which could reduce the number of people being admitted to hospital and speed up recovery.Professor Gilbert has said she is 80 per cent confident the vaccine to be trialled in the coming days will be successful.Personally, I have a high degree of confidence, she said.This is my view, because I\u0027ve worked with this technology a lot, and I\u0027ve worked on the Mers vaccine trials, and I\u0027ve seen what that can do. And, I think, it has a very strong chance of working.The researchers said it is crucial to ensure the vaccine can be manufactured quickly enough to be rolled out on a mass scale when they are sure it works.Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer, cautioned that the whole development process of a vaccine must be covered.He added: This taskforce will ensure the UK can take an end-to-end view. This includes funding research, like the recent NIHRUKRI call, and ensuring manufacturing capability to deliver a COVID19 vaccination as quickly as possible.”Professor Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford, said the team probably has the most ambitious scale up programme of all the groups working on a vaccine.It\u0027s pretty clear the world is going to need hundreds of millions of doses, ideally by the end of this year to end this pandemic, to let us out of lockdown, he said.A vaccine is the exit strategy for this pandemic and then we\u0027re very likely to need a vaccine in future years because it\u0027s unlikely we\u0027ll be able to eradicate this virus.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said the government is working flat out to find a vaccine as quickly as possible, having pledged £250m towards the goal.Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said: “UK scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus, saving and protecting people’s lives. We stand firmly behind them in their efforts.“The Vaccine Taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible.”Professor Sir Mark Walport, chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, added: “The pace at which this work has been carried out is tribute to the UK’s world-class research base and its dedication to the fight against this disease.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/17/TELEMMGLPICT000229007724_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq4lB4GFcd2ffyksCJoOxtkbT5LfTkYhqvBvjfatlPy1M.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"public miles ahead experts coronavirus face masks","story":"In Germany, face masks are now recommendedAt the top of Government, there are fears about introducing any nuance into the Stay at Home message. The Cabinet wants to keep the directive simple. So it’s not very encouraging that on one of the simplest questions of all: “Should I wear a face mask?” the message is clear as mud.A review is under way, Grant Shapps said yesterday. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, isn’t waiting for that. He wants us to wear one. In Germany and America, face masks are now recommended. In other countries, they are compulsory.While the intricacies of vaccine discovery or ventilator production are beyond the vast majority of us, the principle behind face masks isn’t. Coughed or sneezed droplets spread the disease. Yet, asymptomatic people spread it too.The very best masks prevent wearers (usually doctors) from \u2028getting infected. But even simple surgical masks help prevent those carrying the virus from spreading it, which may be particularly useful since the non-appearance of any meaningful testing programme means we don’t know who has Covid-19, and very probably won’t for many moons to come.So, given ample supply, surely it would be a good idea for us all to wear masks outside? Particularly as part of any exit strategy, given what we know about the immense effects of even minute adjustments in transmission rates.Many health agencies, including our own, have disagreed. Yet, it turns out that they have largely based their views on a single source: the World Health Organisation. So, if the Government continued to trust that WHO advice, why the review? Should we be surprised if, as in America, having been nudged to assess the situation themselves, officials here change the advice too?Perhaps the Government is maintaining its wait-and-see approach because, as with other protective gear, there are still not enough masks to go round. But that would make its “guided by the scientists” stance a deception.If that stance is true, however, then it is worth remembering that those scientists the Government is guided by can make mistakes and be subject to bias like the rest of us.On face masks, the public has been ahead of the game. But the pressure of “common sense” would have been useful even if it had been common “nonsense” – forcing a validation, rather than a change, of the existing advice.This is not to say that we’ve had enough of experts. Far from it. In a time of immense crisis their work is vital. But the mask debate shows that we, too, have a duty, to deploy that age-old wisdom of crowds, whether right or wrong, to challenge and be annoying, and make those experts investigate not just the disease but their own assumptions too.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Leaving a computer charged up in this way can therefore reduce its capacity, leading the battery life to fall over time.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead, if the computer believes that it is not likely to need 100 per cent battery in the future, it will only charge up some of the way. The computer will show that the battery is full, but it may not actually be.The feature can be turned off and may not be activated in all situations, Apple said. It will also ensure that the battery life is not significantly affected, the company said.Everything you need to know about the new iPhone SEA similar feature is already in place on Apple\u0027s iPhone, and was introduced in a recent update. It means that the phone will learn when it goes on charge at night and when you tend to wake up, for instance, leaving the final bit of charge until it expects you to get up and start using your phone.The Mac update will work in largely the same way, using its history of charging and battery use to notice times when you tend not to need the full battery life. If a computer tends to be used plugged in throughout the day, for instance, it may not charge up its battery fully.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

One researcher said it had the potential to be really, really stunning as it reached its closest point to Earth, in May.The comet that took 100 million years to pass EarthBut shortly after it became clear that the comet was actually distintegrating, getting dimmer as it did.As well as offering a chance to see the comet as it breaks apart, the images may prove useful to the scientists studying the object. Relatievely little is known about the object, which was only discovered at the very end of 2019.Comet Atlas is still heading on its trajectory towards Earth. Its orbit is similar to the famous Great Comet of 1844, and it is thought that the two might both be pieces of what was once a larger comet.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I misspoke,” he said.“As a heart surgeon, I’ve spent my career fighting to save lives in the operating room by minimising risks.“At the same time, I’m being asked constantly how we will be able to get people back to their normal lives.”He went on to describe\u0026nbspschools as “places of security, nutrition and learning” for children.Many states in the US are currently wrestling with potential timelines to ease lockdown\u0026nbsprestrictions without triggering a renewed spread of the virus.Donald Trump on Thursday gave governors a road map for recovering from the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic, laying out “a phased and deliberate approach” to restoring normal activity in places that have strong testing and are seeing a decrease in Covid-19 cases.The new guidelines are aimed at easing restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus, while holding the line in harder-hit locations.They make clear that the return to normalcy will be a far longer process than Trump initially envisioned, with federal officials warning that some social distancing measures may need to remain in place through the end of the year to prevent a new outbreak. And they largely reinforce plans already in the works by governors, who have primary responsibility for public health in their states.Places with declining infections and strong testing would begin a three-phase gradual reopening of businesses and schools. In phase one, for instance, the plan recommends strict social distancing for all people in public. Gatherings larger than 10 people are to be avoided, and nonessential travel is discouraged.In phase two, people are encouraged to maximise social distancing and limit gatherings to no more than 50 people unless precautionary measures are taken. Travel could resume. Phase three envisions a return to normal for most Americans, with a focus on identification and isolation of any new infections.The guidelines recommend that states pass checkpoints that look at new cases, testing and surveillance data over the prior 14 days before advancing from one phase to another.The Associated Press contributed to this reportThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will also mark the final test before the spacecraft is approved for use, sending Nasa\u0026nbspastronauts to the International Space Station and beyond.Nasa veterans Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, who both took part in a number of space shuttle missions, will be carried up into space on a Falcon 9 rocket at 4.32am local eastern time, from Kenned Space Center. They will go for an extended stay at the space station, Nasa said, but the precise duration of the mission is yet to be determined.During the mission, they will test all parts of the Crew Dragon capsule, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities, Nasa said.Lifting off from Launch Pad 39A atop a specially instrumented Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon will accelerate its two passengers to approximately 17,000 mph and put it on an intercept course with the International Space Station, Nasa said. Once in orbit, the crew and SpaceX mission control will verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system and the maneuvering thrusters, among other things.In about 24 hours, Crew Dragon will be in position to rendezvous and dock with the space station. The spacecraft is designed to do this autonomously but astronauts aboard the spacecraft and the station will be diligently monitoring approach and docking and can take control of the spacecraft if necessary.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

By contrast, the new evidence suggests very clearly that the people of Nazareth lived purely Jewish lives - and kept to all the major ritual laws.The area seems to have been actively anti-Roman. In the year 4BC, an anti-Roman revolt is known to have broken out in the area – and rebels attacked the military arsenal and government treasury in the centre of nearby Sepphoris.Indeed, in Nazareth itself, in the mid-first century AD, the archaeological investigation has revealed that anti-Roman rebels created a sizeable network of underground hiding places and tunnels underneath the town - big enough to shelter at least 100 people.Religious Jews saw Roman and Greek influence as a serious and direct threat to their faith. Thus pious religiosity and anti-Roman politics often went together.The new archaeological investigation – the largest ever carried out into Roman period Nazareth – has revealed that Jesus\u0027 hometown is likely to have been considerably bigger than previously thought. It probably had a population of up to a thousand (rather than just being a small-to-medium sized village of 100-500, as previously thought).No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“Our new investigation has transformed archaeological knowledge of Roman Nazareth,” said Dr Dark, who has just published the results of his Nazareth investigation in a new book Roman-Period and Byzantine Nazareth and its Hinterland.“For the first time ever, we are now gaining a reasonable understanding of the sort of place Nazareth was in Roman times.”By examining in detail all the archaeological evidence, gained from recent landscape survey work and from a detailed reanalysis of previous excavations, we are now beginning to learn about the cultural and economic environment in which Jesus grew up,“ Dr Dark told The Independent.One of the most significant revelations to have come out of Dr Dark\u0027s investigation is the fact that the farmers of Nazareth seem to have had a prohibition on the use of human manure as a fertiliser (in stark contrast to the people of Sepphoris and potentially many other areas). Field surveys by the archaeologists have revealed that, around midway between the two towns, there is an abrupt change in the agricultural strategy (almost certainly, with no human manure on the Nazareth side – and lots of human manure on the Sepphoris side).The discovery is significant because different Jewish groups took very different attitudes to human excrement. Mainstream religious Judaism took the view that such excrement was unpleasant, rather than ritually impure. Their only prohibition on the subject was that people should make sure that human excrement should be at least four cubits (almost 2 metres) away when prayers were being recited.However, an ultra religious Jewish sect called the Essenes (and potentially therefore other extreme groups) did regard excrement as rituallyspiritually impure and unclean (as well as being merely physically unclean and unpleasant). They took the view that all human excrement must be buried so as not to offend God\u0027s \u0027ine rays of light\u0027.The fact that the people of Nazareth seem to have had a strict prohibition on the use of human excrement as a crop fertiliser implies therefore that they too regarded it as ritually impure, rather than simply unpleasant.It therefore suggests that they were, in some ways, either aligned with aspects of Essene thinking or with the thinking of another similarly hard-line religious movement within first century AD Judaism.But in other aspects of their material culture, the people of Nazareth were totally in line with other more mainstream forms of pious Judaism.The archaeologists have found numerous fragments of stone bowls and cups in and around Nazareth: a fact which strongly suggests a high degree of traditional religiosity in the town.Religious Jews of the first century AD believed that stone vessels were immune to ritual and spiritual impurity in a way that ceramic and wooden vessels were not.So to keep themselves and their homes ritually clean, they often preferred to use stone vessels.The belief is stated quite clearly in chapter 10 of the Mishnah (the Roman period compendium of Jewish tradition and law which later was incorporated into the Talmud). Indeed the use of stone vessels for ritual washing is also referred to in chapter 2 of St John\u0027s Gospel. Frequent hand washing (after sleeping, before eating bread, before worship, etc) was, and still is, an extremely important aspect of strict traditional Jewish religious life.However, religious Jews of Jesus\u0027 time may also have been reluctant to use manufactured goods that may have been rendered ritually impure during their manufacture. For instance, by having been placed near non-kosher food or near to a dead body or by having been handled by a woman during menstruation.This fear may well be behind the type of ceramics used in Nazareth.Archaeological sites in Arizona threatened by Trump’s border wallWhy archaeological antiquities should not be sold on the open marketArchaeologists have found thousands of fragments of pottery in and around Nazareth – but, in contrast to the pottery of Sepphoris, it is virtually all of one type - a\u0026nbsprough ware, made in a Jewish village called Kefar Hananya 23 miles to the north of Nazareth. Interestingly, archaeologists have found that the distribution of stone vessels and Kefar Hananya pottery in first century Palestine seems to correlate. It\u0027s likely that religious Jews were taking no chances with their domestic utensils, and made sure that their pots came from strictly religious Jewish sources that could be relied upon to keep them ritually pure during manufacture.The newly emerging picture of Roman period Nazareth as a place of substantial religiosity does, however, resonate with not only the emergence of its most famous son, Jesus. But also with the fact that, in the mid-first or second century, it was chosen as the official residence of one of the high priests of the by-then-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem, when all 24 of those top Jewish religious leaders were driven into exile in Galilee.Indeed, what are probably priestly tombs have been discovered by archaeologists in and around Nazareth. Remarkably, some of them were even equipped with extremely rare life-size glass versions of the goats\u0027 horn musical instruments (the shofarot or shofars which had been used during religious services in the Temple in Jerusalem and which are still blown today during the two most important\u0026nbsp religious events of the Jewish calendar).Significantly, after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD when the Romans destroyed the Jewish Temple there, the shofar gradually, for a period, came to be seen, and blown, as an expression of mourning for the Temple\u0027s destruction.The archaeological investigation in Nazareth will help historians to better understand the ways in which Jesus\u0027 hometown may have helped shape his religious outlook. St Mark and St Luke\u0027s Gospel suggests that his views were not popular there – and it may be that what seems to have been the ultra-strict nature of Nazareth\u0027s religiosity had actually pushed Jesus towards a less strict perspective that would perhaps have been more acceptable to less strictly religious Jews, such as many of those living in places like neighbouring Sepphoris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan\u0026nbspsaid on Friday the total included 20 bus drivers who had lost their lives. “It breaks my heart,” he said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I will continue to do whatever it takes to keep our heroic transport workers as safe as possible,” said Mr Khan,\u0026nbspwho said middle-door boarding would “further protect drivers”.He added: “I would like to remind Londoners that you shouldn’t be travelling by any mode of transport unless it is absolutely necessary, and public transport is only open for critical workers.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastMr Khan also urged the government to change its advice to the public on wearing face masks to help combat the spread of the virus.The London mayor told BBC Breakfast on Friday that wearing non-medical facial masks, such as a bandana, scarf or reusable mask, would add “another layer of protection” to the public.Mr Khan, who wrote to transport secretary Grant Shapps about the issue, said he is lobbying for masks to be worn in circumstances where people cannot keep two metres apart, such as on public transport.TfL trialled the boarding change on 140 buses across nine routes, with the operator saying it was “confident” that the low number of people travelling meant people could keep a safe distance between each other.Limited use of London’s buses by essential workers had led the number of people travelling to “plummet” by about 85 per cent.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But experts tell Jon Stone it still isn\u0027t clear to what extent pupils could spread coronavirusThe government is showing no sign of easing its coronavirus lockdown restrictions, with another extension to the measures confirmed on Thursday. But the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is reported to have privately made clear that if it were up to him, schools would be reopening at the first safe opportunity.The issue is contentious: the science of to what extent children contribute to the pandemic, and by how much, is uncertain. Childcare is becoming an issue for many parents who are not key workers and thus entitled to still send their children to class. And with what started as an extended Easter holiday is in danger of turning into several months off school, pupils are starting to miss out on serious amounts of education.“I suspect we might open schools again, partly because there is still debate about whether school closures are actually beneficial or not,” Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia tells The Independent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We’ve not answered that, and there are very good reasons why school closures, in terms of the children, might actually not be that useful. And if they don’t get that ill, maybe they’re not that infectious – but it is a maybe.”This uncertainty is key to the question of how long this extended Easter break might turn out to be, and whether it starts to turn into a summer holiday before children go back to class.Police find 17 bodies piling up inside nursing home morgueNurses suspended after refusing to treat patients without N95 masksUK coronavirus hospital death toll rises to 13,729Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert in disease modelling at the University of Warwick, tells The Independent that even if children are less effective vectors for the virus, the fact that so many of them would be crowded into schools could pose a risk.“The problem is there’s still an awful lot of uncertainty, and this is the real concern we have,” he says. “We know from the data coming in that children tend to have much more mild symptoms than the older age groups. Where there is still a lot of uncertainty is how much they transmit and this is a big concern.”Children themselves might not be getting sick, but could still be acting as carriers for the disease.“Even if someone is asymptomatic and has no symptoms at all it’s still possible they can transmit the virus. If someone has very clear symptoms and is coughing a lot they’re much more likely to transmit and spread droplets, so it’s very likely that people with very severe symptoms will have a higher transmission rate,” says Dr Tildesley.“But what we don’t know and what’s still uncertain is the role of these asymptomatic or mild cases in infection. This is the concern because of course even if that’s lower the fact that you’ve got a lot of children in one place is a concern.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWith repeated government promises to ramp up Covid-19 testing falling short, there is very little data around about the extent to which people – never mind children – are even being asymptotically infected. Until that bottleneck is sorted, it will be hard to judge exactly how many people are carrying the virus. But with seriously ill people and NHS workers being prioritised for the limited number of tests, people with no symptoms are a long way down the list.The manner in which\u0026nbspthe lockdown\u0026nbspwas implemented\u0026nbspis also a problem, as it becomes difficult to separate out the different measures and tell which ones are making a difference.It may be that if you allow children back to school and we see cases climbing again it may be that schools have to be closed once again.“It may be that if you allow children back to school and we see cases climbing again it may be that schools have to be closed once again.”At this point, any decision to reopen schools, even if it was based on the available scientific evidence, would be a guess –\u0026nbspbecause there isn’t much scientific evidence yet available. But many teachers are worried about being flung into the classroom as an experiment when the science is not yet clear.Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union tells The Independent\u0026nbspit would be reckless to put “political or business” considerations ahead of safety.“Everyone is anxious to return to normality as soon as possible, but decisions to either strengthen or loosen the current restrictions must always be governed by the medical and scientific evidence. Political or business considerations must never be allowed to override the safety of pupils, school staff and the wider community,” he says.“The NASUWT is committed to work with the government to protect public health and the health of our members who, along with other public service workers, are doing so much to help the country through this crisis.”One option being recommended by some epidemiologists is bringing schools back, but with specific social distancing measures to prevent the spread of the virus: setting desks further apart, closing playgrounds, asking children to keep their distance. Teachers could also be given protective equipment (PPE): another union, the National Education Union (NEU) has written to the prime minister asking him to base any decision to reopen partly on the “availability of appropriate PPE and enhanced levels of cleaning”.One study published in The Lancet medical journal, which looks at data from the 2003 Sars outbreak in China, suggests schools could come back earlier if students could be prevented from mixing and have social-distancing measures imposed during class.“Interventions in schools, such as closing playgrounds, keeping students in constant class groupsclassrooms increasing spacing between students in classes, reducing the school week and staggering school start and break times across years or classes, should be considered if restrictive social-distancing policies are to be implemented for long periods of time,” said Professor Russell Viner, one of the authors of the study.In Denmark, schools this week started to reopen in a staggered manner, with different arrival times and just the first five year groups plus kindergartens back for now. The youngest children are going back first because they are thought to be the least vulnerable to the virus and also the most difficult to arrange childcare for, keeping workers tied up looking after their families.But if the UK’s 506,400 full-time teachers are to be given protective equipment, the UK’s supply lines, already insufficient for NHS staff and care workers, are a long way off from being able to cope. And teachers say that there are other practical issues to consider.Katharine Birbalsingh, the high-profile headteacher of Michaela Community School in Brent, north London, has said\u0026nbspit was a “lie” that social distancing is possible in schools.“The fact is that social distancing in schools is simply impossible,” she said. “We’re considered to be the strictest school in Britain and even we would find it impossible.”Number of full-time teachers working in the UKMs Birbalsingh said\u0026nbspshe understood that “schools cannot stay closed for 10 months”, and that they might have to open eventually, but said the government should be upfront with teachers and the public about the risks.“Schools will open at some point, but what I don’t want is for people to perpetuate the lie –\u0026nbspand it is a lie – that social distancing is possible. It just isn’t,” she said.Staffing would also be an issue, the headteacher told the BBC, with supply teachers not an adequate replacement on such a grand scale.“The other thing to remember is that from the point of view of a head teacher, if you have to send home staff who have underlying issues, if you have to send home your staff who have a cough you are probably going to have fewer than half your staff in. So if you have half your staff in, how are you filling your classrooms with teachers? You can’t.“And you’ve got to think about the kind of chaos that then ensues in schools when children don’t have their own teachers – you have cover teachers, and we all know what you used to do in schools when you had a supply teacher.”Dr Tildesley also notes the problems, telling The Independent: “Possibly for secondary school children it’s easier to implement a policy like that for primary school, that’s a challenge –\u0026nbspI’ve got two six year olds, trying to explain to them the concept of going back to school but not hugging their friends is a real challenge. I think that’s difficult.”lockdown extended for three weeks, says Dominic RaabDespite these concerns, other countries in addition to Denmark are going ahead with reopening schools anyway. Germany announced on Wednesday that it would start opening schools early next month, and Austria and France have also set tentative timetables.Given the lack of clear information, this, says Dr Tildesley, could be “useful” for the UK authorities in deciding which way to go.“We are seeing other countries in Europe who have declared that they are going to start sending children back to school earlier than us. That will also give us some evidence,” he says.“It would be really informative to use to look at their epidemic curves and how they might change when children start to go back to school. Of course, every country is different but it would at least give us some evidence of what that effect might be.”But, he adds, evidence would take several weeks to filter through, given the virus’s incubation period – and if schools reopen at the same time as other measures are lifted it would be harder to disentangle the effect. It is for this reason that the European Commission has asked countries to leave gaps of weeks between phasing out different measures stating that “sufficient time should be left between the steps (eg one month), as the effect of their lifting can only be measured over time”. Whether member states, under domestic political pressure of their own, adhere to this will remain to be seen.Created with Sketch.High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)“There is going to be something of a lag in that and two, three weeks really before we start to see strong evidence of what the effectiveness of that policy is,” Dr Tildesley said.If the government makes the leap to opening schools any time soon, it will be somewhat of an experiment.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Schools will remain closed until further notice, except for children of critical workers and the most vulnerable children and we have published guidance on how schools can employ social distancing during this period. We will only re-open schools when the scientific advice indicates it is safe to do so, and will consult closely with the sector on our approach.”“There’s always a trade off here,” says Dr Tildseley. “I accept this as an infectious disease modeller, we tend to be very focused on trying to minimise the risk to human health of the virus, but of course there is another aspect of this and it’s something I’m aware of: you can’t stay in a lockdown strategy forever.“If all we cared about was minimising deaths then essentially you would persist with lockdown. But there’s a practical side to it. At some point you’ve got to start to visit measures for lifting.“This becomes a really difficult political decision because you have the problem of if you open them and it’s deemed to be too soon and cases begin to climb again, you could start to lose public trust.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People are trying new things and noticing differences, at home, in their work and in communities. This is really apparent when it comes to food, farming and the countryside, the issues the commission is focused on, but clear in other areas too.“Alongside the emergency response, it is important to keep track of these changes in what we’re doing and our collective mood, to help shape the kind of country we want to be, including the way want to feed ourselves, when we recover from this pandemic.”It comes after survey results suggested 1.5 million\u0026nbspacross the UK had gone hungry since the outbreak began, with a range of issues including access to funds and an inability to get items from shops leading a growing number of people to access foodbanks.Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation, said: “The same poll that revealed this appetite for social change highlighted an alarming and worsening food insecurity crisis, with three million in Britain going hungry since lockdown began.“These figures create an imperative for reshaping the food system post-Covid-19 so that it delivers healthy diets for everyone, regardless of how much they earn.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The initiative will be launched on Monday when the Hubb Community Kitchen plans to start cooking between 250 and 300 meals a day, three days a week.\u0026nbspThe scheme\u0026nbspfollows a Zoom conference call last week, when the duchess talked to women involved in running the kitchen about how they could adapt their service to feed people at a time when social-distancing rules prevent it from opening as normal. Much of the produce will be supplied by The Independent’s charity partner The Felix Project which sources surplus food from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMeghan said: “The spirit of the Hubb Community Kitchen has always been one of caring, giving back and helping those in need, initially in Grenfell and now throughout the UK.\u0026nbspA home-cooked meal from one neighbour to another, when they need it most, is what community is all about.”How to support our campaign“I’m so proud of the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen, and the continued support The Felix Project gives them to carry out these acts of goodwill, which at this moment are urgently needed.\u0026nbspI’m equally moved by the many people who are contributing to campaign to raise money for these vital organisations in the wake of Covid-19.”The meals will be prepared in the cooks’ homes and delivered by another charity, StreetGames, which runs the Fit And Fed campaign that aims to provide nutritious meals for children at risk of going hungry during the school holidays.The Duke of Sussex, who saw the charity’s work during a visit to one of its centres in Streatham last year, put it in touch with the kitchen.Harry and Meghan on Thursday\u0026nbspcompleted two days of volunteering with Project Angel Food in California, helping to deliver food parcels to people in need.The Hubb Community Kitchen was set up in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster in June 2017, when a group of local women gathered in a communal kitchen at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre.The duchess first visited it in January 2018 and has continued to make regular private visits. She wrote the foreword for Together, a collection of the women’s own personal recipes from across Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mark Curtin, Felix’s chief executive, said: “The women of Hubb Community Kitchen have stepped up yet again in the face of a global pandemic.“We stand together with all of our partners to get food to people most at risk of experiencing hunger and malnutrition in this time of need.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in\u0026nbspThe Independent, said: “It is a pleasure to have the backing of the Duchess of Sussex for our campaign.\u0026nbspHer support for the survivors of the Grenfell fire is truly admirable.

It doesn’t only have to work, it has to be safe. And for a disease like this it has to be very safe, if you are going to use it right across the population. There’s a lot to do before we are in that position.”He added: “Each single project doesn’t have a high probability of success. So although everyone goes into it with great enthusiasm and we hope they work, it is never the case that we know we are going to get a vaccine that is going to work.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We stand firmly behind them in their efforts.“The Vaccine Taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible.”Mr Sharma also announced 21 new research projects to receive funds from a £14m government pot for the development of treatments and vaccines.An Oxford University project to trial an anti-malarial drug with anti-inflammatory properties in order to determine whether it can reduce the harm of Covid-19 to high-risk patientsImperial College London tests on a potential vaccine designed to stimulate the body’s production of protective antibodiesA Public Health England effort to develop a new antibody that could offer protection against infection and disease progressionA Public Health England study into the transmission of Covid-19 on materials found in hospitals and households, including fabric, plastics, metals and ceramics.Joining Sir Patrick and Prof Van-Tam on the taskforce are representatives from government, academia and industry, including the government’s life science champion Sir John Bell, drugs giant AstraZeneca and the Wellcome Trust.They will aim to make the UK a leader in clinical vaccine testing and manufacturing, building on existing research and development expertise.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “We’re doing everything possible to save lives and beat this disease, and that includes working flat out with businesses, researchers and industry to find a vaccine as quickly as possible.“The UK is world-leading in developing vaccines. We are the biggest contributor to the global effort and are preparing to ensure we can manufacture vaccines here at home as soon as practically possible.”The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said: “The UK has some of the best vaccine scientists in the world, but we need to take account of the whole development process. This taskforce will ensure the UK can take an end-to-end view. This includes funding research … and ensuring manufacturing capability to deliver a Covid-19 vaccination as quickly as possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Others said it was “natural, without chemicals, and safe to eat”.Alongside the popularity of southeast Asia’s wildlife markets selling a wide variety of animals for consumption, the trade in dog and cat meat has been rising over the past three years, the organisation says.How we treat animals ‘still risking spreading disease’Before the outbreak, about 10 million dogs and cats were slaughtered for eating in Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia every year, according to Four Paws.But its investigators said they had witnessed and heard how\u0026nbspsales of the meat in the region had risen during the global pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The WHO\u0026nbspsaid that to prevent mass abandonment of pets –\u0026nbspbut it had the opposite effect.”Consumption had also risen because people staying at home want to try more “exotic” meat, Dr Polak said.In interviews last year, patients had told Four Paws how medical professionals had advised them to consume the meat for its “warming and healing properties” thought – falsely – to ward off flu viruses and the coronavirus.The meat is particularly recommended to women after giving birth and is said to increase blood flow for women during their menstrual cycle.Animals around the world benefit as coronavirus halts tourismBut a report\u0026nbsptwo months ago by the group, which has studied the trade in the three countries, concluded there was no evidence for any of the medical benefits claimed by health professionals.“Patients are routinely advised by health practitioners of the health benefits, and vendors are reporting to us that their customers are partaking in dog meat consumption due to the ‘health benefits’,” Dr Polak said, adding that she strongly suspected doctors were now recommending it\u0026nbspeven more in view of Covid-19.In Indonesia, people widely believe dog meat cures respiratory illness –\u0026nbsplargely asthma – so demand for it in that country could soar, Dr Polak said.The animals may be strays or stolen pets, or are bought by traders\u0026nbspwho exchange them for pots and pans.Vendors in Cambodia and Vietnam stand in masks at the roadside, providing bags of the meat, which may be cooked on the spot or for customers to take home.Dogs and cats blowtorched alive at Indonesian street marketsCambodia’s capital Phnom Penh has more than 110 dog meat restaurants, many of which opened within the past\u0026nbsptwo years, Four Paws says.Since the coronavirus pandemic, the organisation’s teams found that a few had closed but most had switched to providing takeaway services.And restaurants across the country are advertising dog and cat meat dishes for delivery on food delivery websites and apps.“This is concerning because we had never seen dog and cat meat dishes being advertised on a food delivery app before the Covid-19 outbreak. It demonstrates that the dog-meat industry is adapting to the increased consumption at home and increased ease of obtaining dog and cat meat, even during a lockdown,” said Dr Polak.“The insanitary conditions of the cat and dog meat trade, coupled with the contamination risks of having so many different animal species caged and killed alongside one another, present the perfect breeding ground for new and deadly diseases\u0026nbsplike Covid-19.“The rampant trade and live animal markets across southeast Asia are ticking time bombs. If governments do not act now and shut down these cruel markets, the next global pandemic might originate in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.”Last week China\u0026nbspclassified dogs as pets, not livestock, for the first time – a move campaigners hope could signal an end to that country’s dog and cat meat trade.Four Paws, which is campaigning for a total ban on dog and cat meat, has long warned of the risk of the spread of rabies from the pet meat trade.The news comes as The Independent’s Stop the Wildlife Trade campaign calls for an international effort to tighten restrictions on wet markets to reduce the risk of future pandemics.A recent study has proposed that the virus might have travelled from bats to humans via stray dogs.cat and dog meat\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

was successfully paired with one of two male owls from a New Zealand subspecies.The cross-Tasman relations meant that all subsequent generations of moreporks on Norfolk Island were now a unique hybrid

If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor’s advice.”However, Public Health England says there is not enough information on taking ibuprofen to help with Covid- in order to tell people stop using it.Dr Tom Wingfield, senior clinical lecturer and honorary consultant physician at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, says someone may opt to take paracetamol because it is less likely to cause side effectstaken over a long period of time.Dr Wingfield says: “In the UK, paracetamol would generally be preferred over non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugssuch as ibuprofen to relieve symptoms caused by infection such as fever.This is because, when taken according to the manufacturer’s instructions in terms of timing and maximum dosage, it is less likely to cause side effects.”Possible side affects of NSAIDs after taking them for long period of time include: indigestion, stomach ulcers, headaches, drowsiness, dizziness, allergic reactions and in rare cases problem with your liver or kidneys.The NHS website previously recommended both paracetamol and ibuprofen.But it since changed its advice, saying while there is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirusworse... until we have more information, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you.Those already taking ibuprofen on the advice of a doctor, should not stop taking it without checking first.Sir Patrick Vallance, the governments chief scientic adviser, said that while there was no definitive evidence that ibuprofen could harm people with symptoms of Covid-, it was prudent to use alternatives where possible.He said: The sensible thing to do for the moment would be not to take it, to take paracetamol or something .The NHS says you shouldnt take antibiotics because they do not work against viruses.It recommends drinking plenty of water, sleeping alone, washing your hands regularly and taking everyday painkillers to treat the symptoms.The NHS says you should self-isolate and don’t take antibiotics as they do not work against viruses.If you shows symptoms of the coronavirus - which is a high temperature and a continuous dry cough - then you are advised to stay at home for seven days.If you are living with family then you are asked to stay home for  days, and the rest on your household are advised to stay home too.If you do not get better in a week or your symptoms get worse, you are advised to medical help.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Your vomit is blue.”If you live alone and develop symptoms it is recommended to stay at home for seven days after symptoms begin.If you live with others, everyone in the house must stay at home and not leave for  days as it can take that long to develop symptoms.If you are worried about your symptoms, you can visit the NHSs dedicated  online service.To protect others, do not go to places like a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.A high temperature is a common symptom.This means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back, you do not need to measure your temperature with a thermometer.A new, continuous, dry cough is also a symptom.This means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

known as being asymptomatic - then the risk of infecting others increases as people do not know to self-isolate.Here, we take you through exactly what it means to be asymptomatic during the coronavirus outbreak...If you are asymptomatic, you are carrying a disease but have no symptoms.According to new research, around half of all coronavirus patients show no symptoms at all but are still infectious.Researchers made the revelation after gathering data from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.Of the , passengers who were tested,  tested positive, and didnt show symptoms, according to Japan’s health agency.Those who are asymptomatic are most likely to be healthy, younger and even children.The US Centers for Disease and Controlsaid: Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Yes, though you may not have any symptoms you could be a silent carrier of the disease and still pass it on to those around you.Science journal Nature says the warning sign of “covert transmission” is finding sick people with no recent international travel or contact with anyone displaying symptoms.The exact rate of such transmission is unknown, but inferences are it’s very high.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe dramatic outbreak in the US state of Massachusetts is a case in point.Researchers believe at least  cases out of , were contracted from spreaders not yet showing symptoms.It can also take five days to show symptoms, research has found, and they can still appear after the quarantine period.Symptoms of coronavirus y widely, with patients reporting a huge range of dferent symptoms.However, the NHS says the two main signs of coronavirus are a temperature above . degrees C or new continuous cough.It’s entirely possible to have just one of these two key features without the other.Some people will start with one and develop the other a day, or even several days, later.As well as a dry cough and temperature, its understood that some people may also experience breathing dficulties, which is when hospital treatment may be needed.In particular, some Covid- patients have reported experiencing tummy ache just before developing the other known symptoms.Doctors have also warned that a loss of taste or smell could also be a sign of coronavirus.The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, which represents experts in ear, nose and throat medicine, has said that those who lose these senses should self-isolate immediately - evenyou have no other symptoms.They added that the eye infection conjunctivitis may also be another sign.Other signs of coronavirus may include brain fog, fatigue and muscle soreness.Currently only people in hospital are being tested for coronavirus, soyou have symptoms and youre not sureyou have the virus, you may well not be able to find out -

I’ve never been so pleased to see my copy spiked.We now know from the PM himself just how close he came to death. But had things turned out dferently, my first sentence would still ring true.Boris would have paid the ultimate price for Covid-.The killer virus was spawned in China’s primitive “wet markets” and concealed by the country’s secretive communist regime and blamed by China on America and the West.Beijing’s claim of only , dead is a sick joke. The true figure could be ten times as high — or more.This, remember, is the regime that still lies about the thousands slaughtered in the  Tiananmen Square massacre.Yet China, having destroyed lives and livelihoods around the globe, is emerging as the big winner from its own pandemic.Like vultures hovering over roadkill, leaders of the world’s second-biggest economy are eyeing up the casualties of this made in-China calamity.Covid- risks opening the door to Beijing’s dominance over world trade and commerce, at unimaginable cost to our freedoms and democracy.Rattled world leaders, from Australia to Germany, are drafting emergency laws to prevent China mopping up crown jewels in pharmaceuticals, minerals, articial intelligence and robot technology.But it is probably too late. The West has turned a blind eye to China’s decades of industrial espionage and its cut-price grab for market share.Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is utterly dependent on cheap, heavily subsidised Chinese components and the VW and Mercedes car sales that account for a third of their profits.Suicidally, it will see Chinese cash as a passport out of the crisis.“We have grown too idle and too comfortable to want to do the things the Chinese do for us,” says a Cabinet insider.The world stood silent as China’s Belt And Road programme gobbled up key ports and industries, rare earth minerals and rich farmland across Africa and the Third World.Beijing is now rubbing its hands at the prospect of fresh bargains.Household-name firms here and in Europe are struggling to survive the lockdown. Some will never reopen their doors.The best might end up in Beijing at fire-sale prices.China has already seized a big stake in the UK with its richly subsidised £billion contract for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset.Telecoms giant Huawei has its sticky fingers all over our sensitive G superhighway — a decision which must now surely be reversed.The image of communist China as a civilised equal partner is a dangerous fantasy.“China is not and never will be our friend,” a senior minister warns. “But it is the only one with ready cash and all our markets have collapsed because of something China started.“Our economy is being shattered and it is their fault. The idea of selling them some of our best companies is horrying.”China’s own economy has been hammered too. But it remains a ruthless totalitarian state which brooks no opposition.The brutal incarceration of a million Uighur Muslims in “re-education” camps is a blot on the civilised world. So is the trade in human organs from executed prisoners.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealWho will stop China becoming the world’s dominant power It will be hard for our liberal elite to swallow, but the only answer is Donald Trump.The American President has already cracked down on China’s trade and currency cheating. Democrat rival Joe Biden — backed by peace-at-any-price Barack Obama — would kowtow to Beijing.At this pivotal moment in world history, it is reassuring to know President Trump has a high regard for our Prime Minister.Once Boris is back on his feet and coronavirus begins to fade, he must join forces with the world’s greatest superpower and address the smiling menace of Chinese President Xi Jinping.As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.Boris was hardest hit, followed by chief of staff Dominic Cummings, who is only now ing to work after a fortnight in bed.A dozen others, including Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and No Press chief Lee Cain, went down like skittles.So who was the super-spreader The finger of suspicion is pointed at health supremo Matt Hancock, first in and energetically first out of self- isolation. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the moment before that.And probably every spare moment since he was obliged to leave the Sandy Lane Hotel, Barbados, to go through the motions at this old ITV circus, for the th time of asking.Britain’s Got Talent, which began with Ant and Dec sentimentally evoking all the things they love about this great country of ours.The White Clfs of Dover, Blackpool Tower, Edinburgh Castle, Russian sausage dog dancers, a Belgian contortionist, from Got Talent Espana, who scuttled across the stage in the spider position. That sort of quintessentially British thing.There was also, you probably sensed, a collective feeling Britain’s Got Talent didn’t just have a responsibility to lt the nation’s collective mood, over the following  minutes, but a moral duty.An unfair burden to put on any show and a forlorn hope, I thought, given the production has, for many years, involved nothing more inspirational than mixing and matching acts from the worldwide “Talent” franchise with the sort of homegrown sob stories which, however worthy and sincere, can feel a bit beside-the-point compared to the nightmare that’s just engulfed the world.And so it mostly proved on Saturday’s episode.Opinions here will dfer, I realise. In the latter category, though, we had a choir and foster care dancer Yakub, who won me over instantly with his modesty and tact as he announced: “My dream is to dance on . . . I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.” In the former, there was the Belgian contortionist, Papi Flex, an Indian dance troupe and Russia’s Diana Vedyashinka, who has spent the past  years teaching five dachshunds to stand hind-legged on a podium.An admission that made me feel slightly better about spending a similar amount of time watching EastEnders, but not much.There were also, of course, acts that fitted neither category, like James Piper, who’s “a personal trainer by day, magician by night”, meaning he can probably make haemorrhoids appear from nowhere.There was only one person, though, who genuinely lted the gloom.That was the brilliant comedian Steve Royle, from Phoenix Nights and Car Share, whose riotous act, pretending to shove ping-pong balls up his fundament, was funny enough even without the earnest health and safety caption from ITV: “Do not try this at home.” For five glorious minutes I forgot lockdown and began wondering about Steve’s next routine. Then I had to check myself.Because that is the sad and unavoidable issue with these BGT auditions. Unless they’ve got about  weeks of material, coronavirus means it’s a series currently going nowhere.Attempt to press ITV on this matter and all it can tell you is: “We are working with our production colleagues to see how we can make the BGT live shows work in an ever-changing situation.”Mind you, attempt to read Simon Cowell’s mind at the moment and I’m sure you’ll get a far more succinct response.“A jetski.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which month of the year was named after the Roman emperor Augustus Hardball, Ore Oduba: “Which animal has large breeds called Clydesdale and Shire ”Ben Shephard: “On a computer keyboard the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”And Ben Shephard: “Gerald Ford served as US President in which decade of the th century ”A BALLSY move, I thought, for ITV to screen a drama comedy about Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’s coughing cheats during the coronavirus outbreak.The dark irony is, though, it was the only show this past week that was good enough to make me forget the ongoing medical crisis for its duration.The second assumption was that Quiz would stand or fall on Michael Sheen’s impression of Tarrant.It doesn’t. And that’s probably just as well, as it’s a slightly hit-and-miss turn. One moment he’s Tarrant, the next he’s Tommy Cooper, but he always looks more like Les Dennis.Luckily for Quiz, however, it barely matters because James Graham’s script sings and Matthew Macfadyen delivers a performance that’s worthy of award nominations playing the thick-as-a-brick Major Charles Ingram. There are issues as well, obviously.Mark Bonnar’s accent sinks somewhere between Stranraer and Larne as Celador boss Paul Smith and there’s an air of ITV self congratulation in the opening hour about Millionaire’s ratings.A dangerous game to play when you’ve now got Secrets Of The Driving Test filling the show’s slot.All is forgiven and forgotten with tonight’s brilliant second instalmentthough, which concentrates on the coughing episode itself and the fallout, as ITV execs try to work out who they should call at Scotland Yard.“It’s the Celebrity Crime Squad.”“Really  It sounds like a s**t detective show.”“It sounds like something we’d make.”Quite.Manny Monthe: “- is a dangerous scoreline because the next goal wins.”Ian Wright: “Pep Guardiola came in and literally cut Joe Hart’s legs off.”Gary Lineker: “Rafa’s comeback in the Champions League final was his finest moment in the Premier League.”IN the continued absence of live sport, the contest of the week was The Great Celebrity Bake Off, on Channel , where two veteran camera-chasers battled it out for screen time and the winner’s apron.A Holly Willoughby on This Morning B Princess Fiona in Shrek The Musical ITV’s hugely entertaining drama Quiz.

It’s no wonder so many bosses and workers are confused – lawyers are too!Without statutes in place and with regulations changing, it can be hard to provide a definitive answer. The Government has announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which means thatyou both agree, your employer can put you on temporary leave .This applies when they are unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of Covid-. If you are furloughed, you will be paid  per cent of your wages by the Government, up to a monthly cap of £,.It sounds straightforward, but your own unique circumstances can make things tricky.  I have been inundated with questions from people who have been furloughed, had their salary cut or lost their jobs.Here, I have provided my answers to some of your most common queries.Q I STARTED a new job shortly before the lock-down. My new company has advised me it cannot pay me the  per cent government pay because I didn’t start before February . What can I do A Annoyingly for you, your new company is almost certainly right. Unless you were on the payroll by February  they are not legally bound to extend the furlough scheme to you. There are talks about this being changed and lots of pressure on the Government because there are a lot of people in your position. In the meantime, you are entitled to Universal Credit — apply now.Q I WAS late getting to work at a food processing plant due to a change in bus timetables caused by the lockdown. My boss said this was a disciplinary offence and fired me. Is this legal A This is probably not legal. If you have been employed for two years or more this counts as unfair dismissal. If you took your employer to an employment tribunal you would have a good chance of winning.  If you haven’t been employed there for  months you would still be entitled to pay for your notice period.  It is possible you could bring a claim for breach of contract as your employer has almost certainly failed to uphold their own disciplinary procedures. You may also be entitled to a claim for discrimination.  Write to this firm making it clear the country is watching their behaviour — as am I.Q I AM on furlough but my employer is holding back a week’s wages I earned before I was furloughed, saying I will get them when my employment starts again. Can he do this  A Your employer cannot do this, unless it was agreed in a contract. You were promised this money and it has absolutely nothing to do with you being furloughed. I have had a number of messages about this unlawful practice and I understand employers are trying to protect cashflow. Butyou were promised this money your firm is not entitled to withhold it.  It may be that, like many others, you will have to work with your employerthey need that money to stay afloat and protect your job, but make sure they put in writing that the money will be forthcoming in due course. Waiting a while for the money may be better than your company going bust.Q AM I entitled to get another job – say, in a supermarket – while I am on furlough from my employer A I have been inundated with people asking this, but the law is not clear. My view is that unless the contract you have with your current employer specically states you cannot take another job , there is no reason why you cannot during this time. There is nothing as it stands in legislation that prevents you from doing this. The government regulationsare not clear and need clarication.  Importantly, disclosure to your current employer is critical. Do not accept another job without giving clear written notice to your current employer that you are taking up other employment while furloughed.Q MY employer wants me to accept a ten per cent pay cut. I checked my contract and I don’t believe they have the power to do this. Do I have a way of resisting this A Your employer cannot unilaterally decide to cut your wages. You have signed a contract and they have promised to pay you. But these are unprecedented times and there is legal provision which may, in certain circumstances, allow employers to sack you and then,necessary, re-employ you on a reduced salary. Multiple employers have asked staff to take a reduction in order for them to survive. The critical thing is thatyou accept such an offer it must have an end date, in writing. You can’t be forced to accept a contract change, including a salary cut. But be warned thatyou do not, your employer can put you on furlough, which will only cover  per cent of your salary.Q I RESIGNED from my job but my new one has fallen through due to the virus. Where can I get help  A I am afraid you will have to claim Universal Credit. It may be worth writing to your old employer to seethere is work still availble, but your legal remedies are limited. The Citizens Advice Bureau is updating its advice on this all the time.Q MY EMPLOYER has gone into administration. Can I still be furloughed A The law makes clear that administrators, independent professionals responsible for either salvaging a bankrupt company or ensuring creditors are paid, can apply to the government furlourgh scheme to ensure an income for staff. However, the administrator will probably focus on attempting to pay creditors and shareholders. Do not let them do this. Get together with co-employees and write to the administrator insisting you’ll not be forgotten and nor will their behaviour.Q I’VE HAD to cancel my holiday and my employer needs me to work during the time I had booked off. Usually we are not entitled to carry annual leave into the next year, butthey are requiring me to work, surely I must have the right to do so A Good news, the Government has amended regulations so workers can carry over up to four weeks holiday into the next two holiday years. This applies where it has not been possible for you to take some or all of your leave because of the virus. However, it has to be because you were required to work.Q I BECAME self-employed in February. Am I entitled to government grants A It looks like you are not, but this may change. You need to have accounts for   to be entitled to assistance. But this situation is moving, so don’t give up hope.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal Q I’M A zero-hours worker. Am I still entitled to be put on furlough  My employer is closed so I have no shts but nothing has been mentioned about furloughing. A The furlough scheme covers zero-hour contract workers so your employer should make an application on your behalf. Get in touch and ask them to explain their policy. It costs them nothing to offer you furlough so I do not understand why they have not.Q I WORK in a shop and my employer has made no effort to make the environment safe for the workers. In other shops I have seen screens at tills and employees issued with gloves and masks. We have none of that. I don’t feel safe. Am I entitled to stop working without risking my job A It is shocking that there are no specic health and safety regulations protecting workers like you which have the full force of law. I do not have a clear answer about whether you are entitled to refuse to go to workthe business is open and offering essential services. However, in due course your business failing to make the environment safe could be grounds for constructive dismissalyou were to make the decision to walk away. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to write to your line manager asking them to provide safety equipment, making it clear the environment is unsafe and explaining that you will be considering your optionsadequate safety measures are not introduced.Q I WANT to go on furlough, but my employer has cut my hours by half. How can I make them furlough me so I can get  per cent of my pay instead of  per cent A Your boss can’t just slash your hours by half, that is a straightforward breach of contract. If there is no work for you to do then furlough should be offered to you. Write to your employer at once asking for them to explain why they think this is lawful. I look forward to their answer.Q I CAN’T work because I have to shield myself due to health reasons. I asked my employer to furlough me and they said they couldn’t because I can’t work, so I am currently on unpaid leave. Is this fair A  This all depends on your circumstances. If you are able to work from home, and are healthy enough to do so, your employer should offer you this option. If your employer is unable to operate, or there is no work you could doyou did not have to shield yourself, then you should be offered furlough. Butthe business is an essential service that has remained open, and you have to attend work in person, the remedy is to apply for statutory sick pay .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some are already bust. Le will never be quite the same again.The Treasury is stumping up billions to pay furloughed full-time workers, help the self-employed and offer Universal Credit to the very large number who slip between the cracks.We are piling shedloads on to our already massive national debt. For many firms and iniduals this is a devastating blow from which they may never recover, financially or mentally.Lives lost from delayed emergency care, alcoholism, drugs and domestic abuse have rocketed.Together with fatalities from other causes — mostly poverty and despair — they could dwarf the toll from the virus.Some children’s le chances will be wrecked by a long break from school or, worse, from being cooped up with violent family members.Those who keep their jobs may be forced into severe pay cuts. Costs will spill down through the generations.Not everyone is suffering.Public sector jobs and pensions are secure, for the time being.Some with savings, decent homes and jobs they can do from home might actually be enjoying Easter with their families at their side.Breadwinners forced to stay in instead of eating out or flying abroad will have spare cash in their pockets at the end of the month. And some will have grabbed Rishi Sunak’s offer of  per cent pay to put their feet up at the taxpayers’ expense.But it all adds up to a crimson bottom line that our children and grandchildren will have to meet over decades to come.

But what will remain — and at what cost Downing Street, without its most important figure at the helm, must find a way to save Britain from destitution without being blamed for “putting money before lives”.It is a challenge only a loony Corbynite leftie would wish on their worst enemy.But to govern is to choose.And despite having just escaped his own near-death experience, it is impossible to see it happening without Boris Johnson’s say-so.The PM knows there will be questions to answer once all this is over.They are already coming thick and fast — on testing, NHS capacity and protective equipment for NHS staff.These need to be settled fast — at literally any cost.We will then need an inquiry into the failure of so-called “experts” to see this coming.We will want a detailed explanation from the Public Health England quango which focused costly resources on obesity and ersity, rather than the pandemic they war-gamed four years ago.Why, for instance, were they so slow to allow non-NHS specialists into the fast-accelerating battle against Covid- A gargantuan rise in debt and unemployment. A terrying collapse in tax revenues. A vast Government bailout to save businesses and jobs.It should be a comfort that these same official forecasts also predict a rapid rebound, assuming the lockdown ends and the virus is largely conquered.But eventhat startling optimism — which we struggle to share — is borne out, immense and permanent damage will already have been done. Millions of jobs will have been destroyed, thriving firms bankrupted and a monstrous new debt pile amassed, taking years to pay off. The pain of the austerity era after  will have been a mere taster.It is good at least that Britain now knows this. We hope it sinks in.

There is no longer a risk of it being overwhelmed.This was one of the key reasons for the draconian crackdown — to avoid an unmanageable “spike” in crisis admissions.That risk has diminished.

We sing very close to each other and partner dance and there’s even kissing – and then there were the packed audiences too.When they made the decision to shut down it was still a major shock.As a single mum without much financial help I was scared we’d be out on the street. I have a friend who works at Sainsbury’s and she hooked me up with a job two weeks ago and I absolutely love it.The people I work with are genuine and lovely and I plan on staying as long as they’ll have me. It’s not as much as the West End would pay, but I am just starting out.I do nine-hour shts starting at am, working the tills, manning the queue, helping the online team – very dferent from my usual job. I spend most of those hours on my feet working and it’s exhausting.But I feel proud when I can help someone find what they’re looking for and don’t have to ask a colleague. Everyone at Sainsbury’s is like family and they’ve really welcomed me in.Obviously it’s far less glamorous than starring in the West End but I enjoy the challenge of learning new skills and working with people.I look forward to the theatres re-opening and getting back to singing on stage but for now I’m happy to just sing in the aisles!But Jenner isnt the only Brit to have swapped the spotlight for a new job during this pandemic.Keegan Brown, , from Carisbrook in the Isle of Wight is the th best player in the country.He has put his darts career on hold and taken on extra shts as an assistant in an NHS blood-science lab.While playing on the PDC pro tour – a series of darts tournaments for professional players – I tried to work three days a week in my lab assistant job, he tells Sun Online.This would normally consist of two full days am to .pm and one day from am to pm. But since the darts calendar has been put on hold I’ve been doing a minimum of five days and the hours can be anything now, including night shts and also on-call days.I figurethe NHS can use my skill set to help or support the service, then I want to offer anything I can to help in the midst of this pandemic. We have all been up-skilling too, to help backfill when people are being forced to take time off.The NHS has always had a family-feel but even more so now as we’re working under such dferent circumstances, something I’ve never experienced.My we Roz is extremely proud of me but also very worried. She worries about everyone!But I am so lucky to love both of my jobs. They come with highs and lows and there are times I prefer one to the other, but overall they both make me happy.The darts is more full-on, intense and competitive and you’re mostly judged on the last game you played.It can be an emotional rollercoaster and you do have to learn to grow a thicker skin.Working for the NHS can also be full-on and intense but you’re working as part of a team – rather than on your own - and you do feel like you’re making a dference.I’m not practicing my darts as much as I’d like to, but I am still keeping my arm in as much as possible. Just last night I was playing online darts with some children from a darts academy. The academy contacted me and I was happy to help!Leivi Saltman, , from North East London, is a professional photographer - but is now working at a greengrocers.I’ve been a professional photographer for six years and cover everything from engagements and weddings to charity and corporate events, he tells us.A typical day is editing photos, keeping my social media updated and going on location visits to scout out a venue so I can figure out lighting and places to get the best angles and atmosphere.Then in the evenings I’m usually out photographing events.When I first started hearing about the virus, there wasn’t a massive effect on my work and only one or two jobs were cancelled. But once the government ruled there should be no public gatherings, that pretty much tied my hands. Twenty-five events were cancelled or postponed, which was the majority of my events leading up to July.A friend of mine put a post on Facebook that a local greengrocers were looking for help and I thought, ‘Why not I am earning less compared to my photography, but it helps to structure my day and gets me out the house. It’s a full-on day starting at am and finishing at around pm.My typical day is unloading the lorry, which is full of fresh fruit and vegetables bought from the market that morning at am.Once the lorry is unloaded and put in the fridge, the remaining tasks include stocking up the shop, putting together customer orders and making sure there aren’t any empty shelves or shelves low in produce.There’s a lot more manual labour involved than in photography, but it’s surprised me how much I’ve really enjoyed it.I like meeting new people each day and being a part of a team rather than working on my own. It feels like I’ve become a part of their family and I’ve learnt a lot about dferent types of fruit and vegetables and how you should store them.Of course, I’ll be going back to photography when the crisis is over, but I will miss the greengrocers too.

It’s all due to social distancing.Even though it’s dficult for everyone, it’s working. I’m concerned that people may become more lax as time passes, and so would strongly encourage them to keep it up so that progress is maintained.The bridge was packed last night with well-meaning families, young children and emergency workers - but many were failing to socially distance as they packed together facing the hospital.Every Thursday at pm since Britain was put into lockdown the nation has clapped out of windows and at their front doors to thank frontline workers.Medics have said the weekly clap gives them a boost during gruelling shts, but last night those gathered on the bridge were slammed for potentially creating more cases for staff to tackle.politan Police Commissioner Dick led dozens of officers in the weekly applause for key workers at pm last night.A video posted to the forces Twitter account shows her standing in front of officers, who are lined up with gaps in front of police vehicles along the bridge near Parliament.But the gesture drew criticism from some after the clip filmed by DrRafi emerged showing groups of people, near police officers, seemingly ignoring social distancing guidance.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: We would ask that everyone takes responsibility and adheres to social distancing rules so that we can safely show our appreciation for those who are working so hard to fight coronavirus.He added: We would ask that in showing their appreciation for those who are working so hard as carers, they do so in a way which adheres to the social distancing rules.SUN readers are today urged to sign a petition calling for our NHS staff to be awarded the George Cross.Yesterday, we backed a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking readers to sign the petition online at thesun georgecrossfornhs.A furious nurse wrote under the video: This is just really infuriating!!!!

Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a ­balance between the health of the nation and our economy.“The introduction of a relaxation easement strategy eventually leads to a full exit.”Among the latest deaths is -year-old nurse Mary Agyapong, who died of coronavirus five days after her baby was born.It is understood doctors performed an emergency caesarean on the medic shortly after she was admitted to hospital last week - having lost her dad to suspected Covid- just days earlier.Mary joins over  NHS heroes who have sacriced their lives to treat patients during the crisis.It comes as War hero Captain Tom Moore completed  laps of his garden yesterday, raising more than £ million for the NHS.The -year-old WWII veteran completed the last few laps on his zimmer frame - and insisted he will continue for as long as people keep giving money.It comes as Britain could stay in lockdown until June over fears lting the drastic measures too quickly could lead to a second wave of the pandemic.Ministers feel pushing the lockdown to May or even June would be the right move.Others believe keeping it shut for too long risks a complete economic meltdown.Plans are being considered to reopen some primary schools and nurseries next month - with schools outside London and Birmingham set to be the first to open once the lockdown is lted.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My team have sourced a supplier that can provide enough PPE for every TfL worker for  days, and I’ve written to the Mayor to offer my help.

If governments do not act now and shut down these cruel markets, the next global pandemic might originate in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.Despite the global pandemic, the continued sale of dog and cat meat in the region has seen a transition from a cruel ‘dine-in’ to a ‘to-go’ service.With  dog meat restaurants across Cambodias capital of Phnom Penh, vendors are taking sales one step further by offering dog dishes on food delivery apps.Vendors can also be seen wearing facemasks on the roadside as they hand out bags of dog meat for customers to eat or prepare at home.In Vietnam, a similar trend has been observed particularly in the north of the country, where dog and cat meat consumption has a longstanding history.Doctors are also said to be promoting the consumption of dog meat because it is perceived to be ‘natural, without chemicals, and safe to eat’.One seller in Cambodia said that those in her community believe that, ‘dog meat is good for health and helps ward off cold or viral illness, like COVID-’, however the meat is often linked to outbreaks of cholera, and cases of trichinella and rabies.The meat can be a cheap alternative but Micheal Chour, founder of animal charity the Sound of Animals, says that the rise in dog and cat meat consumption is due to Chinese influence, with many restaurants only opening in the last two years.He told the Sun Online: People are still eating a lot of the meat in these areas because they believe it to be a cure.They was a big increase in the number of Chinese workers coming to the country and they have bought many of their practices along with them.Many of those, such as torture, have been introduced here and people believe that because China is a big and powerful country, that we should be listening to these practices.There is a very little warning from the government because wet markets are good business, they are still happening.In the wake of the COVID- pandemic, the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai have banned the eating of dogs and cats as part of a wider clampdown on the wildle trade.Yet in the absence of a national ban, other cities in mainland China are believed to be considering their own legislation to stop the consumption of dogs and cats.China has also drawn up new guidelines to reclassy dogs as pets rather than livestock, as part of a response to the coronavirus outbreak.The announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture was described as a potential game changer in animal welfare. The new virus, which is believed to have originated from horseshoe bats, put a spotlight on Chinas wild animal trade.COVID- - which was first identied in the Chinese city of Wuhan - could have been passed onto humans by intermediary species on sale at a wet market.Those markets, where wild and often poached animals are packed together, have been described as a breeding ground for disease and an incubator for a multitude of viruses to evolve.As it stands, Vietnam has  cases of coronavirus and no recorded deaths with Cambodia having  cases and no confirmed deaths.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We can confirm that production of all our products continues uninterrupted at all of our manufacturing sites.Despite this, the Government has stressed suppliers are still able to make items available.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: We know how distressing shortages can be for patients and we are doing everything we can to ensure patients continue to access safe and effective medicines.We are aware there has been a signicant increase in demand across a number of inhaler presentations and we are working with suppliers to ensure supplies continue to remain available.Health care professionals and patients are reminded to only prescribe and order what they need during this time to ensure that all patients can continue to access their medicines.Sarah MacFadyen, Head of Policy and Public Affairs, at Asthma UK, said: “Some people with asthma have told us that they are having dficulty in getting hold of inhalers, in particular Clenil Modulite  micrograms. We’ve asked the Department of Health and Social Carefor some clarication on the issue.The DHSC have told us that they are not currently aware of any medicine shortages, and therefore, problems with obtaining asthma medications are most likely due to local supply issues as the demand is currently high.We have been told that Clenil Modulite  micrograms is now back in stock, but availability may be slightly limited over the coming weeks as it has not been in stock for long.The DHSC advice is that If your pharmacist doesn’t stock this inhaler, they should offer you an equivalent alternative, which might involve your GP changing the prescription you have been given.They say that they understand that this is concerning and that’s why they have been in touch with manufacturers to address the problem and give people the most up-to-date advice.People with asthma are not more likely to get coronavirus than anyone .But Covid-, like any respiratory virus, may make people’s asthma worse, putting them at increased risk of asthma symptoms and even potentially le-threatening asthma attacks.The World Health Organization  also lists asthma, along with diabetes and heart disease, as a condition that makes someone “more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.”Jessica Kirby, Head of Health Advice at Asthma UK, said: Asthma doesn’t make you more likely to get coronavirus, but unfortunatelypeople with long-term lung conditions like asthma get coronavirus, it can be more severe.People with lung conditions are more likely to experience complications and need hospital treatment.Any respiratory infection can cause problems for people with asthma, and so far, evidence shows that coronavirus is no dferent.The best thing you can do to reduce the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by a virus is to ensure your asthma is as well managed as possible – which means taking your preventer inhaler every day as prescribed, and keeping your reliever inhaler with you all the time so you can use ityour symptoms get worse.If your asthma symptoms get worse, and you haven’t travelled to an at-risk area or been in contact with someone who has, make an appointment to see your GP as soon as you can. If you think you might have coronavirus, use the NHS  online coronavirus service.Ms Kirby also said anyone having an asthma attack should follow the steps on their asthma action plan and call  for an ambulanceneeded.She added: The best thing people with asthma can do to cut the risk of getting coronavirus is to follow the NHS guidance, which is regularly updated.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe NHS have since issued an update on what asthma sufferers should do, including attending any essential appointments alone.GPs may ask patients to have their consultations via a video call or over the phone.Sufferers are also being told to regularly clean their equipment with detergent like washing up liquid and not to share with anyone .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Labour leader said ministers are failing to take decisions on when and how tothe UK to normal le - and suggested the government has not acted “quickly enough” throughout the crisis.Mr Starmer has been calling for the government to set out details of how the government plans to release the UK from lockdown.Mr Starmer told the BBC’s Coronavirus Podcast: “I think that throughout this theyaposve struggled with taking decisions quickly enough.“The other factor though, I think, is we all know that the Prime Minister has been in hospital. “Weaposve all been pleased to see that heaposs come out and is feeling better. And it feels as though theyaposve been in a position probably for a week or  days now where itaposs been dficult for the Government to make big decisions. And I think thereaposs a bit of that lying behind this as well.  He added: “I suspect, although I donapost know, that Dominic Raab is just reluctant - he probably does know that itaposs time for an exit strategy - but heaposs probably reluctant to sign it off without the Prime Minister and I think thereaposs a bit of that in the mix.”Asked about Mr Starmer’s comments, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “I don’t know that that’s fair. I think we’re all right now struggling with unprecedented circumstances, and we’re trying to plot a way through it.” But she added the Prime Minister’s convalescence “doesn’t make it any easier.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps branded the claim “completely untrue”.He said: I was surprised to see that being said for the simple reason that yesterday alone I attended cabinet, I attended the Cobra [meeting]...I attended two or even three of the cabinet subcommittees that are making all of the day to day decisions.Itaposs simply not the case that everythingaposs on standstill. There would be no dference to those decisions because we have been guided by, as I keep saying, the scientists and the medical advice, whether or not the PM had been in the room or not in the room in this instance because this is a disease which does not look to politicians to decide how to respond, it responds to science.So thataposs not the case at all and I hope we can continue withy the very impressive cross-party and indeed national effort with this virus and not turn it into those kind of discussions. In a statement released last night, Mr Starmer welcomed First Secretary of State Dominic Raab’s announcement that the lockdown would continue for at least another three weeks.

Boris Johnsonaposs stand-in Dominic Raab confirmed the drastic measures will go on another three weeks, until May  at the earliest. That means police can still fine groups of two or more people for gathering outside, unless theyaposre from the same household. And you can only leave home with a reasonable excuse - shopping for necessities, exercise once a day, a medical need or work where you have to. But todayaposs extension doesnapost mean that the lockdown will end on May . Mr Raab said the overallof the lockdown could be around three months and warned it might only be adjusted rather than lted altogether. That means while schools may reopen in May or June, working from home could continue for a year. So what does todayaposs decision mean - and how and when might the government start shting restrictions in the next few weeks  Hereaposs what you need to know.How long is the UKaposs lockdown extension  The UK coronavirus lockdown has legally been extended until it is next up for review, on May .  According to the Health Protection Regulations , Health Secretary Matt Hancock must review the emergency powers every three weeks.  Does this mean the lockdown ends on May   No. You should not look at the three-week extension and think that means it will all be over in three weeks. May  was only chosen because that is theof time for each review period, stated by the law. The government can announce on May  that it is extending the lockdown - either wholly or partly - for another three weeks. Or technically the government can choose to review the measures before three weeks are up . In other words, the May  date is totally arbitrary - despite the fact it sits conveniently just before the May  VE Day bank holiday.  When will the lockdown end  Dominic Raab warned the lockdown could go on for around three months in total. Askedit would take three weeks or three months for restrictions to be eased, he said: “The Prime Minister said at the outset that it would take three months to come through the peak - and I think that broadly is still the outline.” He said government advisors SAGE will review the latest lockdown extension by the end of the month. We simply donapost know yet though. The lockdown can only end when the UK is well past the peak of coronavirus cases and deaths. Government advisors believe we may now be at that peak or slightly past it, but itaposs too early to say. If we lt too early the virus will run rampant, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock.   How will the lockdown end   The lockdown is very unlikely to be lted in one go. It will be removed a little bit of the time to prop up the economy while protecting peopleaposs lives. Mr Raab was careful to focus on “adjustments” to the lockdown rather than axing it, and said we may eventually transition out of where we are. When there is a change, he said, it could involve relaxing measures in some areas while strengthening measures in other areas. Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said some measures may have to continue until we have a vaccine - which could be a year away. He said: There may be a number of measures that need to continue in order to allow [the virus] to be suppressed and controlled whilst vaccines and therapeutics come along.  What is the government looking for to end the lockdown  Dominic Raab set out five tests that the evidence must show before lting any lockdown. The government needs to be convinced that:The NHS is able to cope There is a sustained and consistent fall in death Infections are decreasing to manageable levels Testing and PPE numbers are adequate across the country Any adjustment wonapost risk a second peak of infectionsIn what ways might restrictions be lted  Travel to outdoor spacescould be one of the first restrictions lted - as long as social distancing is properly adhered to. And schools could re-open as it is vital they take the strainparents are to go back to work. But visiting loved ones in care homes could be off the table for some time, as could reopening pubs and restaurants. And chief scientic advisor Sir Patrick Vallance indicated working from home may be one thing that has to stay in place until we get a vaccine.Ministers are looking at a range of options. Itaposs understood theyaposre considering a plan to let younger people out of lockdown earlier than older people, because they are generally less at risk and prop up the economy. Ministers are also looking at plans to reopen coffee shops or hair salons, for example, by broadening the current list of essential shops. And they are looking at the idea of a phasedto school, with classrooms outside worst-hit London and Birmingham reopening earlier than in the cities. But no final decisions have been taken.  "},{"url":null,"title":"astonishing photos show birth second","story":"NewsAstonishing photos show birth of second most premature twins babies ever to surviveTracey Hernandez and Anthony Hope were told their twin girls, Makayla and Makenzie, would have zero chance of survival after being born at just  weeks in their amniotic sacsShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsTracey places a kiss on one of the twin girls who were born at just  weeks \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Professor Anthony Costello, of University College Londonaposs Institute for Global Health, told a committee of MPs that the harsh reality is that we were too slow with a number of things and deaths could reach to ,.His comments came as the Department of Health said a total of , patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of pm on Thursday, up by  from the day before.Prof Costello said: If weaposre going to suppress the chain of transmission of this virus in the next stage we all hope that the national lockdown and social distancing will bring about a large suppression of the epidemic so far - but weaposre going to face further waves. And so we need to make sure that we have a system in place that cannot just do a certain number of tests in the laboratory, but has a system at district and community level. Prof Costello, giving evidence to the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, said we should not have any blame at this stage but that we can make sure in the second wave weaposre not too slow. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that testing will be expanded to those in the police, fire service and prisons, as well as critical local authority workers, the judiciary and Department for Work and Pensions staff where required.  It follows criticism of a gulf between those being tested and the testing capacity, with just , tests being conducted in the  hours up to am on Thursday, despite , tests being available. Mr Hancock confirmed to the committee that more than , NHS workers have now been tested for coronavirus, and admitted he would love to be able to wave a magic wand to increase supplies of personal protective equipment . MPs were also told that healthcare staff are genuinely concerned about the safety of patients being compromisedworkers are spread too thinly. Dr Alison Pittard, Dean at the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said: Weaposve had to spread ourselves more thinly and we have developed guidance to try and make sure that continues to be safe, butwe have to expand even more and spread ourselves even more thinly, there would be concern that safety could be compromised.  So everyone is working really well, weaposre doing everything that we can but staff are genuinely concerned. Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, told the committee sick NHS workers are being forced to drive two hours away to be tested. She urged: We need some really clear direction on how we can access testing both in the NHS but more so for social care, because they donapost have the same infrastructure as the NHS. Prof Costello, a former British director at the World Health Organisation, said he was not sure we need , tests per day in realitywe can get this epidemic damped down and that it was more important to have the systems in place. How are they restructuring the public health teams  Have they got plans in place Will they need extra volunteers, for example He also suggested offering incentives to % of the population to stay socially isolated in order to get the economy going again. We have to get the economy going andit means locking down % of our population, even giving them incentives to stay in quarantine and with digital apps to help monitor their symptoms and give them support, thataposs the way to really keep this going until we get a vaccine and safe herd immunity.The committeeaposs chairman Jeremy Hunt later called for a massive ramp-up - not just in the testing, but also the tracing of everyone who has been in contact with someone who has the virus. He told BBC Radio aposs World At One programme: If weaposre going to be in a position where we can track and trace every single person who has Covid or might have had Covid in three weeksapos time, because thataposs when we could next potentially end the lockdown, well that is a huge logistical undertaking.

New images show that foundations had already been dug, concrete poured and metal structural supports installed.  In one photo construction can be seen continuing at night. The reason for the renewed urgency is not stated in the report, but experts agree that the building is coming together quickly. Martyn Williams and Peter Makoswky from North Korea watchdog,  North, analysed the project in satellite photos.  “Construction has continued at such pace that for the first time – after just under one month – the overall outline of the building is visible,” they wrote. “Commercial satellite imagery from April  shows clear outlines of the two towers that will dominate the rear of the hospital. “The rest of the building is also taking shape, including a distinctive lip that juts out from the front of the hospital.”  North Korea’s two closest neighbours have had tens of thousands of coronavirus cases, but the Kim regime says there has not been a single one within its borders. The claim cannot be independently veried in the closed-off country and has been met with scepticism.

The droplets behave like an aerosol - a suspension of particles or droplets in air or another gas - and can penetrate deep into the lungs when they are breathed in, scientists found. A team from the US National Institutes of Health used a laser light-scattering experiment to demonstrate how droplets fill the air when a person speaks, and how masks can block them and prevent the spread of Covid-.

Molecular biologist Dr Matthew Meselson, of Hard University, wrote: Certain persons called apossuper spreadersapos produce many more aerosol particles than other persons. These particles are too small to settle because of gravity, but they are carried by air currents and dispersed by dfusion and air turbulence. Inhaled aerosolised particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and infect cells in the alveoli, air sacs in the lungs which exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules to and from the bloodstream, the study found. The particles can be carried by drafts. Dr Meselson added: Aerosols from infected persons may therefore pose an inhalation threat even at considerable distances and in enclosed spaces, particularlythere is poor ventilation. The possible contribution of infective aerosols to the current pandemic suggests the advisability of wearing a suitable mask whenever it is thought that infected persons may be nearby and of providing adequate ventilation of enclosed spaces where such persons are known to be or may recently have been. The researchers said some studies have shown that the number of droplets produced by speaking is similar to the number produced by coughing.Masks can prevent the droplets from filling the air, the scientists said. A separate study in the New England Journal of Medicine in March found that aerosolised coronavirus could remain in the air for up to three hours.

The mask can be created with just a thin paper towel, two elastic bands and a stapler. The single-use masks reportedly limit the transmission of droplets, lowering the chances of coronavirus carriers passing on the disease. Staples are used to secure the mask the elastic bands go around the useraposs ears. The creators said the mask should be thrown away after each use. Myczkowska-Szczerska, who heads the Designing Basics faculty at the Krakow Academy of Fine Arts is a specialist in visual communication including papercrafts, posters and book publications. The video is being widely circulated in Poland as everyone in the country is now required to cover their noses and mouths when leaving their homes. Since most of the world went into full blown lockdown, coronavirus hacks aplenty have been keeping citizens in isolation busy.  When lockdown was first announced almost four weeks ago, panic-buyers stripped the shelves of supermarkets bare, fearing goods would dry up. One top tip was to freeze milk in an ice cube tray for tea and coffee to avoid wastage.According toeatbydate , fresh milk can be frozen for three to six months. Though the texture and colour of the milk may change once thawed, it is still safe for consumption. One the milk cube has been thawed at room temperature, it can be added to tea and coffee when desired.

Fatemeh Khishvand, who became an Instagram star due to her alleged transformation, is said to be on a ventilator and fighting for her le at Sina Hospital in Tehran. The -year-old was detained in October last year amid a crackdown on Instagram celebrities, and faces charges including corruption on earth, encouraging youth to engage in lunacy, insulting the sacred” and “acquiring illicit income”, said activists calling for her release. Lawyers for Ms Khishvand, known on Instagram as Sahar Tabar, had begged a judge to free her due to Iranaposs coronavirus outbreak - the worst in the Middle East - but she was refused bail even though other prisoners have been released following similar concerns. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. Lawyer Payam Derafshan told the US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran : “We find it unacceptable that this young woman has now caught the coronavirus in these circumstances while her detention order has been extended during all this time in jail. Ms Khishvand faces years in prison for engaging in peaceful freedom of expression on her personal Instagram account, the CHRI added. Iran has suffered one of the worst outbreaks with almost , cases and , deaths reported by Tehran and the country has been accused of grossly under reporting cases and deaths. A parliamentary report said the actual number might be almost twice as many and warned that up to  per cent of the Iranian population could test positive for Coovid-isolation measures are not implemented.  In a worst-case scenario, as many as , could diejust  per cent of containment measures are in place, the report added. Ms Khishvand became an Instagram star in  when she posted photos of her transformation. She claimed she had undergone  surgeries to look like Oscar-winning actress Ms Jolie, . But Instagram users dubbed her a zombie due to her hollow cheeks, upturned nose and gaunt appearance. But she later admitted she had achieved the look through the use of make-up and digital editing, and shared photos of her actual appearance. Her lawyer, Mr Derafshan, said Judge Mohammad Moghiseh repeatedly denied to release her on bail as the coronavirus outbreak worsened, and the judge is now unreachable. Mr Derafshan added: “It’s not the prison director’s fault that she’s behind bars. The responsibility rests with Mr Moghiseh.” Jail officials denied that she had caught the disease.  But Mr Derafshan said: “It seems like it has become a habit for the authorities to deny everything. “It makes no sense to deny this. The prison director should acknowledge the infection and admit she has been hospitalised.” He has called on Tehran to release Ms Khishvand and other prisoners who were detained on allegations of committing non-violent crimes.  He added: “Many women in Shahr-e Rey Prison have contacted my colleague and me about the terrible situation inside the prison and the fear that exists among the inmates [due to the coronavirus]. “We want the authorities to issue a general order to allow these prisoners to be temporarily released. In the absence of judges who are sick or not coming to work, this is the only solution.” The Iran Human Rights Monitor has described Shahre-rey, the prison where Ms Khishvand was detained, as the most dangerous and worst prison for women in the country due to its inhumane medical and psychological conditions.

but haven#t revealed whether it will be a #yes# or #no# from Dens Park.The Dark Blues today released a y statement detailing their side of the ongoing story that has rocked Scottish football over the past week after days of near silence from managing director John Nelms.In it, the Dens club spoke of clubs being #negatively impacted in two substantial ways# through the SPFL#s resolution proposed last week for which Dundee#s vote is still to be submitted and took aim at the governing body.They called for concrete promises on league reconstruction infor vote in favour of the proposal saying #The centrewill have to accept and support the will of the members# after saying #appetite for reconstruction is there# among clubs across the country.The statement reads: #Good afternoon Dundee fans.  I hope this statement continues to find you safe and healthy as we continue to be quarantined in our fight against the Covid- virus.  The past week has been fraught with anxiety, vitriol, conspiracy theory, and of course a far ranging amount of media conjecture and commentary.  Below is a brief enlightenment of our thoughts and processes over the past week.#Impact of the SPFL resolution:  Relegated clubs were negatively impacted in two substantial ways: the lost opportunity to avoid relegation, and the lost opportunity for financial support.#As we previously stated, the end of the season due to the COVID- epidemic should not result in any club being worse off than they were prior to vote.#In our opinion the SPFL’s “solution” for the league was not a solution for all teams in the league.  Knowing that most teams desperately needed cash flow before the end of April, the quickest and easiest way for the SPFL to achieve that was this proposal however, the result was immediate inequity, and mid-to long-term instability.#Understandably, that was the driving factor for a ‘yes’ vote from many clubs.  Outside of clubs receiving an injection of immediate cash, this was unacceptable to us as we feel the actions of the league should be representative of all its members detrimental impact to one club is ultimately detrimental to all clubs.#Furthermore, the proposal left little prospect for league reconstruction, another signicant aspect of long-term sustainability for Scottish Football.#Whilst the lockdown has resulted in tremendous hardship for the country, one opportunity it has presented, in Dundee FC’s point of view, is the restructuring of the league.#Dundee FC’s vote:  Because of the situation detailed above, it was our intentionto vote ‘no’ on the proposed resolution.#Despite being electronically submitted, for whatever reason, our vote did not reach the centre #We were not aware of that, however, until the SPFL published the ‘results’ of an incomplete vote and it was shown that Dundee FC’s vote was not received.#This raised an immediate red flag for us not only was our vote missing, but we discovered that at least two Premiership clubs had modied their position from the understanding we had the day prior. It was then that we decided to put our foot on the ball and pause.#We conveyed that decision to the centre and ceased taking calls on the subject.  We needed time to develop a clearer DFC view on the situation.#Whilst it is not our responsibility to take the lead on solutions for the league , it is our duty to attempt to ensure that the future of Scottish Football remains promising for all the clubs.#To that end, we have we have worked tirelessly to achieve solutions to help those who were being disadvantaged and sought ways to help them.#We have discussed options with a iety of member clubs to show solidarity to the clubs most negatively impacted by the SPFL proposal.  Relegated clubs must have financial assistance to help soften the landing so they can begin the next season on more equitable footing.#Through our discussions it appears that there is an appetite to provide ious forms of support from other member clubsthese clubs are in fact relegated.  Further details of these acts of kindness and solidarity will be worked out amongst the member clubs.#Also, we are sorry to disappoint all of the conspiracy theorists by saying that we were never exposed to any ‘deals’ from either of the Glasgow giants.  They both acted, as we would expect, with complete professionalism.#Additionally and most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes does not give us much of a chance and this is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.#There are several things that have to be in place in order to deliver a proper opportunity of achieving a better foundation for Scottish Football’s future.  First, a working group should be assembled and must have members from the highest levels of Scottish Football with long-term interest in the future success of the game.#We need to agree a set of goals that will be the basis of reconstruction which takes into account current and future wants and needs of media member clubs’ financial benefits and sporting integrity as a basis.#It is our belief that after speaking to numerous clubs that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to set up an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.  The centre will have to accept and support the will of the members.#We do believe the centre has made mistakes in this process, namely not taking into consideration any financial fallout to their member clubs and publishing of the incomplete ballot results, which has put Dundee FC in a position to receive criticism and undue torment.#If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal.#We would like to thank the fans for their patience, and most of the member clubs for their cooperation and support during this time.  Make no mistake, we continue to have a daunting task ahead of us, but we are encouraged by everyday acts of kindness, resolution, and humanity that we are all sharing as we get through this together.  Stay safe and hope we see you soon in a newly revamped league.#lthr  gtltstronggt🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

This was a highly unusual end to the season, to say the least, and not the one any of us would have preferred, but all three deserve enormous credit for their performances over the course of the season.“With the turmoil and uncertainty caused by the Covid- outbreak, there was always going to be a highly-charged and passionate debate about how we secure the future of Scottish football.“It is no exaggeration to say that this was an existential matter for Scottish clubs, with many of them telling us they were at real risk of going under unless the situation was resolved very quickly, so I’m pleased that the game has moved decisively.“Whilst more than % of clubs agreed with the directors’ written resolution, it’s clear that others were strongly opposed.“There has been talk of voiding the season, making emergency loans and so on, but what has been agreed today is not just the best way forward, it was the only realistic way forward and I now call on all  clubs to move forward in a constructive and positive way.”SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster also had his say on tonight’s development.He said: “Prior to this positive result, we were unable to make the vital end-of-season payments, which will provide a leline to so many clubs in the lower isions.

up her JustGiving page, setting her off on a flying start on her -day challenge to run almost k every day.The Scotstown Primary pupil has previously taken on km junior fun-runs in Duthie Park – but has never taken on a test of endurance quite like this.Her mother says she is immensely proud of her daughter, and believes her determined character will see her through to the final run.Carly Tuckwell said: “Frankie has seen so much on the news about the NHS and she just decided she wanted to do something to help, so we came up with this idea.“It’s a km run in  days and it’s a doable amount for her, as it’s just under k a day.“I’m saying it’s doable, but it’s a fair distance for an eight-year-old to run.”Her fundraising page has already surpassed its original £ target.Carly said: “I think she’s still running on a high from it all because on the Monday she was really excited to go and start her challenge, and on the Tuesday we woke up and she had £ of donations overnight.“She’s really chuffed with herself.”Each day, the pair plan their route and head outdoors to bring themselves one step closer to completing Frankie’s -day goal.While running, Carly says they look out for rainbows in windows, painted in support of the NHS, which she says makes their runs more exciting.She said: “I’m so proud.“I just think it’s an amazing thing to do, and to raise the money and to even commit to doing that distance every day.“It’s great for an eight-year-old and she’s definitely determined to make sure she finishes it all.”She continued: “Her dad has promised he is waiting till the very last day to donate to keep her going, so she’s really determined.”Frankie hopes she will be able to visit paramedics at the Scottish Ambulance Service depot in Aberdeen.Carly said: “It will be nice to show her where the money is going, I think that would be really sweet.”Frankie added: “When I go out for a run it is a bit tiring but it’s worth it because I want to raise money for the NHS.“I would love the chance to meet the paramedics after the lockdown and get a chance to go inside an ambulance, and press the sirenthey let me.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/8749e211-a9ef-458a-b249-d6ea538124c3-240x180.jpg

I’d like Dundee United coming up, I’d like Inverness, I’d like Hearts to stay in the league.“If you had those big clubs in the league it would be good for the league.“For ourselves we’ve missed going to Dundee and Dundee United as those grounds are ones we like visiting as we take big crowds and they are games you want to be involved in.“Even Inverness, when they were in the league, although it was not the best of journeys, the games attracted a good support and they were good games as well.“It’s outwith my control and it’s down to the league but I’d like Dundee, Inverness and Dundee United in the league for sure.“You’re playing more teams but the league want Rangers playing Celtic four times a season as it has more people watching and it benefits the other teams in the league as well.“It attracts money into the game and helps the other teams outwith Celtic and Rangers but it’s the league’s decision.“I’m surethe league wants everything done right and as much money as possible they will want Celtic and Rangers playing each other as much as they can.“Having  or  teams in the league may hinder that in their eyes.”McGinn has been keeping himself busy during lockdown by training as well as helping Aberdeen’s Community Trust with phone calls to check on supporters.He has also been helping the trust with deliveries of food.The -year-old has been following developments this week with the lower league seasons declared over.McGinn has sympathy for those teams negatively impacted by the decision.He added: “It’s a tough situation to be in, even in the lower leagues where Falkirk are a point behindand Partick Thistle had a game in hand and a chance to move off the bottom of thetable.“You definitely feel sorry for the players there and the fact they didn’t get to fulfil their fixtures.“If you are in mid-table and not challenging or fighting relegation it is perhaps an easier decision to make but you do feel sorry for the teams who will be affected the most.”June  is the earliest clubs in Scotland will be able to resume training and it will be even longer before matches .McGinn reckons, following the extended lay-off, everyone will appreciate football more when it eventually s.He said: “We won’t take things for granted. We appreciate how much football and sport means to everyone.“We go out trying to win every game and fans will always be serious and passionate about their sport.“But everyone being able to watch their team win, lose or draw, can do so with a smile on their face.“There are games we won’t win but we have to come away happy we’re still able to play.“It’s times like now that you definitely appreciate when you were playing and whether it is three games a week we play you just want to be out there playing.“It will feel strange coming back after a long break not playing.“But I will appreciate things a lot more and hopefully we can attract more fans to help out the league and the inidual clubs.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAt the Argyllshire Advertiser we take pride in impartiality, believing our readers have the gumption to work things out for themselves without us reporting matters in a biased way.In the past five years, the paper has spoken out on just two important issues.

Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The most-quoted line is a statement of Scottish independence.Mr Noble said the idea behind the forthcoming book, titled Conquered by No-one, was that  modern-day Scots would write about the  signatories to the Declaration.But Mr Noble himself is writing about two iniduals ndash William Ramsay, Earl of Dalhousie, and Malise IV, Earl of Strathearn.Authors of other chapters include Linklater ndash former editor of The Scotsman ndash and historian Murray Pittock.Mr Noble said: ldquoWhat I see as the underlying justication of this publication is to try to raise the profile of the Declaration of Arbroath as the most signicant document in Scottish history.Mr Noble said the -year-old document introduced the concept of government by consent to Scotland.ldquoI think thatrsquos the critical thing and why itrsquos the most important document in Scottish history, said Mr Noble.ldquoItrsquos recognised by the United States Senate as a contributing factor in the discussions that took place before the signing of the Declaration of Independence in  and itrsquos something that has had a status in the English-speaking world for quite a long time, but lost its traction in Scotland.Mr Noble said a recent survey of Scots found that around a third did not know much about the Declaration.The same poll revealed that many supporters of Scottish independence viewed the Battle of Bannockburn as more important, said Mr Noble.Asked for his own thoughts on Scottish independence, Mr Noble noted that he has lived in England for many years so would not be allowed to participate.Buthe were permitted, he would choose to remain in the United Kingdom, he said, albeit with the hope that a federal system would eventually emerge.Mr Noble said: ldquoI donrsquot think Scotland is going to stay as it is ndash I think decisions in the main should be made in Edinburgh but I believe in shared sovereignty and I think therersquos a value in being part of the UK.He added: ldquoIrsquom not yet persuaded that complete independence is in Scotlandrsquos interests but I certainly think we should be going a lot further in that direction than we are at the moment.Mr Noble is the chairman of the Royal Caledonian Trust, a charity that supports the education of Armed Forces children. He is immediate past president of the Caledonian Society of London.During his career as a teacher, he was headmaster of Bexley, London, which was then the largest school in the capital. When he was a schoolboy himself, he attended Peebles High School.Conquered By No One will be published later this month by Hammer  Mirror Books.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water.

You could use them.The hare stroked his ears.ldquoSo I do he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so the squirrel and hare ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, collecting as much water as possible.They both ed to the fire, and stood a safe distance away. The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by.

A number people have been posting their own activities on the Facebook page showing the kinds of activities they have been doing.He added: ldquoPeople were wanting to know what they could do and that is when we came up with the idea of quarantraining. We have a programme which involves a daily word and people can do exercises linked to each letter of a word we post on social media. We have YouTube videos which show how you can keep fit while doing everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea.Already Climb Scotland is thinking ahead to the days after lockdown.Mr Smith added: ldquoWe are having conversations about that at the moment and I think there will be need to be a phased approach. Anyto climbing or hillwalking will have to be done gradually and safely. If you have had a month or two off from climbing, you are not going to be as fit and have the same strength back immediately. Finger strength is very important for a climber and that can be one of the first injuries when people make a comeback as it needs to be done gradually.ldquoWe have to make sure that peopleto the sport safely. If you have had a break from any sport you need to ease back into it and mountaineering is no dferent.ldquoGiven that people have been in lockdown, it many well spark interest from newcomers to the activity as I am sure people will want to get outdoors and enjoy Scotlandrsquos beauty.* Shops across Scotland are closing.

We all have habits that we perform every single day, we make cups of tea, we brush our teeth, we have a glass of water. What I want to show you is a way we can take advantage of these current habits, to make new habits. So, letrsquos take my example of drinking tea.While Irsquom waiting for my tea to brew, I can practice doing push ups. Over time doing push-ups will become a new habit attached on to my old habit of making tea.PracticeThe next point is, I would like you to think of these exercises as practice not training. In training itrsquos easy to get bogged down by sets and reps but these are not important for practice. In practice, we arenrsquot concentrating on how many reps we can do but rather on the movement itself.Practice is as much about increasing our own body awareness as it is about performing the exercise. Try and do these exercises slowly and with focus. Ask yourself questions like, where am I generating tension in my body now If yoursquore struggling to focus as the exercise is too easy or too hard, each video will show you some iations that you may find easier or harder.FormThe last point I want to talk about is Form.No-onersquos form is perfect when theyrsquore starting out with a new exercise. We all find it dficult doing something new, so donrsquot beat yourself up about it and more importantly donrsquot give up in frustration.Dficulty gives an opportunity to improve.In each of the videorsquos wersquoll give you some pointers to help improve your form. We need feedback in order to make adjustments to improve this form. We can do this using body awareness like I mentioned earlier but it can also be useful to video ourselves doing these exercises, to seewe can spot any issues.So there you have it, three things to keep in mind when doing these exercises:Use old habits to create new habits these exercises are an opportunity to practice movement form takes time and practice to develop.* Shops across Scotland are closing.

The internet means access to sophisticated online archives is only a mouse click away and there are scores of websites offering advice to those hoping to discover their inner Sherlock Holmes.It all makes genealogy ndash and historical research more generally ndash ideal for locked-down Scots seeking mental stimulation at home.The premises of institutions such as the National Library and National Records of Scotland might be shut but thatrsquos no barrier when information can be obtained instantly and from anywhere. Even more importantly, much of it is free.Researching your family treeThere has over the last two decades been an explosion in the range and richness of online content available to those looking to find out more about their ancestors. Public interest in family history has grown just as rapidly.The ScotlandsPeople Centre in Edinburgh , part of the National Records of Scotland, provides online access to births, marriages and deaths, as well as wills, census documents, Coats of Arms and valuation rolls.Fees are charged for viewing some items but, explains Iain Ferguson, Centre Manager, the entire operation has been designed to maximise speed and ease of use.ldquoInstead of the olden days when you had to come in, we now have digitised museum records, he says. ldquoYou just type in a name and year, and the system can search for it in an instant. And you have the opportunity to look up images of records.Of course, the online quest to trace a family tree doesnrsquot have to be limited to big national organisations.Independent websites can also offer a vital helping hand. FindMyPast , one of the largest and best known, gives armchair genealogists access to billions of records and its archive is expanding all the time. Late last year, it announced a new online collection spanning nearly five centuries of Dundee and Angus history. The materials provide names, dates, residences and occupations, as well as photographic documents of streets and people. Many are full colour scans from paper originals.Technology and a certain BBC TV show, says Mr Ferguson, have combined to turbo-charge the popularity of genealogy as a hobby ndash and therersquos no sign of a slowdown.ldquoI would say there has been growth in the number of people being interested in family history, certainly, particularly around ten years ago, when Who Do You Think You Are was on television, he adds.ldquoAnd, as time has progressed, more and more records have been put up by family history societies and so on. People are far more keen. They have a thirst for knowledge.Itrsquos good to talkWhile technology undoubtedly supports the task of discovering an ancestor or their involvement in a major historical event, theres no substitute for conversation with family when it comes to unearthing the most exciting clues.Grandparents, aunts, uncles and, of course, mum and dad should all be among the first ports of call. Even older siblings and cousins can helpelderly relatives have passed away. And video chat apps mean the coronavirus lockdown is no obstacle to enjoying quality, face-to-face contact.ldquoTalking to your family is hugely important, says Tahitia McCabe, Genealogical Studies Postgraduate Programme Course Director at the University of Strathclyde.ldquoItrsquos the way you get the juicy bits - the stories and all the interesting stuff. Genealogy is about bringing history, people and places to le.ldquoThe official records donrsquot tell you the lsquowhyrsquo. They can only really capture the interface with governments and organisations, all the formal things that happen in your le. But there are lots of things that happen that donrsquot get captured in a formal way.Moving the focus of genealogy beyond official records and on to real human relationships is crucial to its wider appeal, says Ms McCabe, adding that the number of people under  attending her courses is definitely ldquocreeping up.The broader pictureAn accurate record of inidual events is vital but so is context - and few institutions are better equipped to provide this than the National Library of Scotland .Its huge multi-media archiveis a gold mine for digital genealogists and historians of all ages, particularly those seeking information about ancestors caught up in the two world wars.Lists of officers enrolled in the army, navy and air force, and an extensive collection of black-and-white photographs from the Western Front, are available free of charge. Also on offer are clan histories, maps and a moving image archive containing footage from communities across the country. Lucy Church, NLS reference services assistant, says such resources are vital for adding a social dimension to the raw information set out in documents such as birth, marriage and death certicates.ldquoPeople use [our collection] to find out about specic iniduals but what itrsquos best for is the bigger picture ndash social and local history, for example, she adds.ldquoWhat we have available has vastly increased in recent years. Since the internet has been available, the archiving world has really engaged with it - and how we can provide a service through it.Stressing that staff are always on hand to assist home users in dficulty, she says: ldquoIf you think of institutions like ourselves, the National Museum of Scotland, National Records ndash they all have really excellent websites. The best way [for people] to familiarise themselves with the collection is to have a look and just be guided by what their particular interest is.Parents in particular will find Scotlandrsquos major cultural institutions invaluable when theyre trying to keep children busy. The NLS website features a wide-ranging learning zone with materials about topics such as the womenrsquos suffrage movement.The Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust, meanwhile, has created dedicated online resourceswhich its leaders hope will inspire youngsters to create prose, poetry and art about Bonnie Prince Charliersquos famous victory in  over a government army led by Sir John Cope. Entries will be published online and organisers hope to include as many as possible in a special commemorative book to mark the battlersquos th anniversary.Also offering online home schooling assistance is the National Wallace Monument, which has launched a video series to help young people learn about William Wallace and the Wars of Scottish Independence. Available at www.nationalwallacemonument, it is aimed at children aged between  and  who are encouraged to watch the videos and answer questions based on the content.Catherine Morrison, Learning and Volunteer Co-ordinator at Stirling District Tourism, says: ldquoUsually, Irsquom hosting trips for school children at the Monument, or visiting schools to teach them all about William Wallace. These are things wersquore not currently able to do, but we wanted to do something to support parents and keep their children learning about history.Sidebar ndash top tips for the budding genealogist Start with what you know. Begin by writing down everything you know about your family ndash names, dates of birth, places of residence. Evenall you have are rough dates and more questions than answers, itrsquos a place to launch your project. Talk to your family ndash do this sooner rather than later. If elderly relatives have all passed away, try older siblings or cousins. Search official records. Generally, yoursquoll want to try and obtain birth, marriage and death information for your ancestors and anyone  on your tree that is of interest. Plus, finding them on available census records is of primary importance. Itrsquos best to start as close to the present as possible and work your way back. That way you can usually very facts with your memories and records, or by checking with other family members. Once you have built up your skills, keep going! You could get involved in new projects such as a transcription or indexing project in your spare time. This is a great way to expand skills in deciphering old handwriting.

Simple language, delivered calmly and directly, has the best chance of sinking in.Honesty, clarity, calmness and directness have never been more vital than now, as we try to take in the enormity of the coronavirus crisis and its consequences. And yet many of our leaders are showing themselves to be woefully, shamefully, sometimes even deliberately incapable of giving straight answers to some of the most fundamental questions.The public accepts that scientists and medics do not yet understand every facet and quirk of this virus. But there is simply no excuse for the disgraceful lack of honestly and clarity around many issues that politicians can control.If ever there was a time for politicians be direct with people, this is it. We do not want obsequiousness, we do not need the pill to be sugar-coated. Donrsquot patronise or insult us. Just tell it like it is, even when itrsquos bad. Especially when itsbad. Be honest when ministers get stuff wrong, or when they donrsquot know the answer to something. Be up front when the system is struggling to cope tell us what work is being done to remedy failures and give us a realistic assessment of whether the action will be successful.:Home Secretary lsquosorrypeople feel there have been failings over PPE supplyrsquoWe badly need a new, more direct approach, particularly from the UK Government, one that is better able to encompass the eye-popping statistics and harsh truths created by coronavirus.The current information vacuum grows more worrying by the day. After all, there is still no reliable death toll, no UK or Scottish stats that include care home and community deaths as well as those that took place in hospital. Grieving relatives are left to tell their stories on social media, devastated that their loved-onersquos death doesnrsquot seem to count, distressed at the lack of knowledge or discussion around care home guidelines.There is still no honest or plausible explanation for why so few coronavirus tests are taking place, or why tracing ndash which has helped Germany and South Korea keep deaths down ndash was abandoned so early on. It cannot be unrelated that no minister or official dares to explain why the death toll in the UK is on course to surpass that of Italy and Spain, despite having had more time to prepare. People in England are dying of Covid- at . times the rate of Ireland, which has a comparable number of ICU beds per head of population.Theses and explanations already exist, of course, but are not judged by politicians to be politically expedient or comfortable. And thatrsquos how you end up with the likes of Home Secretary Priti Patel, the coldest fish this side of Greenland, issuing a textbook  apology ndash ldquoIrsquom sorryYOU feel there are failings ndash at a recent daily briefing. This chastising tone is an insult to us all, not least the dead and bereaved.Indeed, the defensive insults are starting to stack up. Over the weekend Ms Patelrsquos cabinet colleague Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, made the contemptuous suggestion that the continuing shortage of personal protective equipment at the frontline could be down to doctors and nurses over-using it.And while some sections of the media choose to focus unhealthy amounts of attention on one particularly well-known Covid- patient, offering a running commentary on his recovery complete with sudoku, texts from his girlfriend and the films he is watching from his hospital bed, it is left to others to highlight the far bigger tragedies already emerging from this crisis.As Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis pointed out in a blistering attack on the patronising and ldquomisleading language being used by some ministers during the crisis, we are not all in this together.

That the arrogance of this post-imperial country, with its delusions of Global Britain, led the UK elite to ignore the threat of Covid- until it was too late.Many Scottish nationalists feel much the same and say that Scotland has been harnessed to inept policies fashioned by a grossly incompetent Tory clique in Westminster.If only we could have closed the border with England, they sigh, looking at the way Jacinda Ardern has handled things in New Zealand, where the disease appears to have been stamped out by a total lockdown. At least for now.Reports that English firms had been declining requests from Scottish care homes for protective gear only confirm the suspicion that Scotland is a low priority, at the back of the queue, an afterthought.The SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil is by no means alone in believing that Scotland would be better ldquodealing with [our] own problems unfettered..[like]Norway, Ireland. Many MSPs are saying so privately, and wondering why Nicola Sturgeon is not distancing herself from the ldquolaissez faire approach of the English Tories.It was certainly possible that Scotland could have taken a dferent path to the rest of the UK. Smaller countries like Iceland and Singapore moved faster in locking down against Covid . Ireland closed the schools earlier than we did and seems to have been much better at suppressing the disease. Certainly the crude death rate has been around half the UKrsquos.But there is a problem: throughout this crisis there has been no signicant dference between Ms Sturgeonrsquos approach to coronavirus and that of the other three nations in the four-nation pandemic alliance. SNP MPs may say that the Scottish Government was press-ganged into backing the UK approach to handling Covid- and that her instinct was to go for a much tougher lock down earlier. However, there is no basis for thinking this.When Leo Varadkar made his dramatic announcement on March  closing the schools in Ireland, the First Ministerrsquos response was that this was unnecessary. She said she agreed with her own medical advisers that the disease would likely be spread just as readily by children at home, and that the emergency services would be undermined by parents having to stay at home to look after their kids.As for testing, this was actually stopped by the Scottish Government in mid March. As the National Clinical Director, Professor Jason Leitch, told Channel  on March , ldquocommunity testing and contact-tracing was halted after the containment phase. The First Minister was fully aware of this. On April , standing next to Ms Sturgeon, the then Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said that testing was ldquoa distraction. This seemed to be a general view among UK medical advisers.Ms Sturgeon has said that she ldquofollowed the science. This has been the mantra used by ministers like the UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, since this outbreak began. Many commentators regard this as a convenient excuse for incompetence. ldquoWhy didnrsquot they listen to dferent scientists and the World Health Organisation who were advising countries to test, test, test But Britain has some of the best epidemiologists in the world sitting on the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies. The UK Chief Scientic Adviser, Professor Patrick Vallance, said again yesterday that ldquoI donrsquot think it is quite right that testing saves lives. Our medics still believe that tests should be confined to people who have symptoms and to essential workers. Mass testing will only make sense in their view when there is a reliable antibody test ndash and there isnrsquot one.Yet, testing and contact-tracing seems to have worked where, not just in South Korea, but in Germany where the death rate has been signicantly lower. Critics like Professor Devi Sridhar, Chair of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University, insist that the Scottish Government could and should have embarked on mass testing, though itrsquos not clear how it could have found the capacity so to do.She also claims that Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon adopted a ldquoherd immunity strategy because of ldquoBritish exceptionalism. Herd immunity has morphed into an ideological battle-ground, rather than an epidemiological truism.The problem for politicians like Ms Sturgeon is that they are expected to base their policy on ldquothe science, listen to the ldquoexperts, and make policy ldquoevidence based. But as soon as they do so, they are liable to be accused of listening to the wrong kind of scientists.Epidemiologists take a long view about the progress of a disease through its le-cycle involving several peaks and troughs. They have said from the start that since there is no vaccine,  per cent of us are going to get the disease anyway so there is no way of stopping it. That was one of the first remarks Ms Sturgeon made about Covid-.It is what the top UK advisers, like Professor Vallance meant when they were talking about herd immunity. In the absence of a vaccine, they believed that the only way the disease would die out would be when most of us were exposed to it. Prof Leitch was adamant on March  that : ldquothe alternative ndash closing the borders and locking everyone down ndash doesnrsquot work over a prolonged period.Thatrsquos as may be, but it now looks asthe politically savvy thing to have done was to ignore all this and go for a panic lockdown to show the voters that you are serious. In politics, doing something is always more appealing than not doing something.Scientists donrsquot have to answer to Twitter. The political cycle is not on the same trajectory as this disease, and politicians will get no credit for being right in a couple of yearsrsquo time.Shops across Scotland are closing.

Top of it was a bottle of whisky, which entailed waiting for the cordon to be lted from the alcohol shelves at ten orsquoclock sharp. In my tweed coat and Alice-band I probably embody the profile of a rural alcoholic. Trying not to look desperate or furtive only made it worse.Whisky isnrsquot my tipple, but among my first thoughts ahead of the lockdown was to ensure we had enough wine to see us through. The problem, of course, is how to define enough. Judging by the spike in wine deliveries across the UK in March, many were equally eager to lay down a cellar ndash or in our case a boiler cupboard ndash for the troublesome times ahead. During the stampede, an Edinburgh friend reported that it wasnrsquot toilet roll she was having dficulty sourcing but tonic water, as the capital prepared to self-isolate with gin.Can alcohol be classed as necessary  Not by any medical standard of nutritional value. Yet for those living with ever-rising levels of anxiety, you could make a case that, as an aid to relaxing, and in creating a semblance or chimera of normality, it is as vital as vitamin C.It probably goes without saying that one personrsquos essential is anotherrsquos treat. Income plays some part in what we consider crucial to keep body and soul together. Yet beyond the basic and inarguable provisions for making decent meals and keeping the household clean, where exactly is the line that distinguishes justiable consumption from self-indulgence  And who is in a position to judge one from the other  On a scale of one to , for instance, how do ice-cream or pimento-stuffed olives score  Are beef burgers or pizzas the wisest way to eat, or could a police officer confiscate these and insist we replace them with broccoli and wild salmon Most worrying of all, for me at least, is whether we should be abstaining from olive oil, the ingredient without which no dinner in our house is considered complete, and replacing it with a local equivalent, thereby avoiding air miles, and supporting our own economy  If so, what would that stand-in be ndash dripping or lard While the police thankfully did a U-turn on its threat to put our shopping under surveillance, it will have made some of us considerably more self-conscious as we feed our goods onto the conveyor belt. I never normally give it a thought, but now Irsquoll be worrying what antisocial habits my trolley reveals.Doubtless the contents of most baskets would not cause an officer to pause for a nanosecond, unless they included a box of party invitations and enough barbecue coals to fuel a power station. But now the issue has been raised, it makes you re-evaluate every purchase.After rummaging through my wardrobe, I can probably get through to the end of the year without buying anything  other than plimsolls. By December I might be looking a little shabby, but thatrsquos hardly news. And, since mending and making do is enjoying a comeback, others will presumably be in much the same state.If nothing , this enforced stasis offers the space to reflect on how often what we buy is surplus to requirement. Compost bins and landfill must be groaning under the weight of food whose sell by date, like one of Douglas Adamsrsquos deadlines, whooshed by ages ago. Last week a neighbour discovered self-raising flour among her long-lost ingredients at the back of the cupboard and, after checking for weevils, enjoyed a baking spree with some equally ancient dried yeast. Going through his chest of drawers, my husband came upon a lovely unworn jumper of mine that is at least a decade old, but looks brand new. That I hadnrsquot noticed its absence speaks for itself.What previously felt like must-haves now simply suggest a reflex. The act of repeatedly reaching out and purchasing says more about a magpie urge to acquire than any critical shortage. This is not a puritanical call to give up the worldly or frivolous or, when the good times , to eschew the pleasures of things that, strictly speaking, we could get by without. Tens of thousands of businesses, artists and companies would be bankruptedwe adopted an ascetic lestyle that pared everything to the bone. In fact, when finally we unlock, we will actively need to help cash-strapped outfits and iniduals get back on their feet.As Europe takes its initial tentative steps towards easing restrictions, the notion of what is indispensable to daily existence moves beyond the hypothetical to something more profound. In some parts of Italy, bookshops, stationers and stores selling childrenrsquos and baby clothes are now being allowed to open, under strict conditions. In Austria, meanwhile, garden centres and hardware shops are back in business.These highly specic priorities are revealing of each nationrsquos personality. And while some would refute the idea that books or plants are anything other than accessories, Irsquod go to the barricades to defend both as central to survival. After sustenance and medication, we need a reason to exist beyond merely ticking over. The proleration of good bookshops in Italy shows its reverence for literature, a cultural bias that is confirmed by this decision. Perhaps the authorities recognise that, while enforced incarceration is likely to continue for some time, people must be allowed to feed their minds and imaginations as well as their stomachs.The same goes for gardening, which is a universal expression of the desire to nurture and grow. Such is the over-abundance of stock in garden centres and nurseries right now, getting the tills ringing makes economic sense as well as offering a glimmer of light at the end of the polytunnel.Shops across Scotland are closing.

The cry goes up that \"something must be done ndash we are failing our older people\". But the context is that in an average year nearly  per cent of deaths are in care homes. Of course we should not just shrug our shoulders and ignore avoidable shortening of le, but we should also recognise that care homes are clusters of highly vulnerable people. It is not surprising that an epidemic leads to many deaths in them.Anyone can get Covid- and anyone can die of it. But across the population as a whole it is predominantly people who are already vulnerable who are most likely to die. Age per se may not be a risk factor but it is a pretty good proxy for vulnerability. In ,  per cent of Sottish deaths were age -plus of Covid- deaths it is %.We cannot keep lockdown in place forever or even until some future promise of a vaccine. One way of partially exiting might be to remove most restrictions for those under age  who are not otherwise vulnerable. That would let most businesses, schools and so onmore normally. The interface between those released and those more vulnerable would be complicated to manage, but probably no more complicated than any other partial exit.We need to find ways to cope, physically and mentally, with a manageable number of severe cases and deaths from Covid- for the foreseeable future. The alternative is a devastated economy and shattered society.To avoid readers thinking this letter is from a young person seeking to benefit themself, Im  and my we is .Dave Gordon, Scone.BACK in Nazi Germany iniduals were valued for their usefulness to the state. If you were crippled, or old, or handicapped you were disposable. I would never have believed this philosophy was alive and well in  UK, but it is becoming clear from the horric statistics now emerging that a whole section of our community was excluded from the kind of intensive care which brought many, including Boris Johnson, back from the brink. South of the Border the policy was overt here there doesnrsquot seem to be a smoking gun, but the figures speak for themselvesThe callousness shown to the those needing support has been extended to those doing the supporting. A friend in England ed from sick leave to find that as a care assistant at her hospital she was denied any access to the limited supply of protective equipment. The story has been repeated here, again and again.When this is all over there will be inquiries as to why the UKrsquos handling of the pandemic has been so woeful compared to what happened in Germany and some other countries. I hope there will be a special focus on the events in British care homes. It is too much to expect that anyone will be punished, as they were in Germany in , but at least there can be naming and shaming and the bereaved relatives of care assistants and their charges will have some minor consolation.Martin Axford, Bridge of Weir.THE time will come when detailed consideration, which will include dficult political decisions, will have to be given as to how the mountain of debt incurred by the UK in the fight against the pandemic will be repaid. This involves serious amounts of money with the issue in a number of areas of what were effectively blank cheques.There are many who were embittered by the measures taken by Coalition and Conservative governments in what became known earlier as the  Years of Austerity. Those years led to key services being cut, including the NHS. The roll-out of Universal Credit pushed more people into poverty, some into deep poverty. As a result, food banks sprung up all over the country. Grants to councils in high areas of deprivation were cut substantially and consequently spending in these areas was the subject of deep reductions. There are those who believe that we were not quite all in it together. We must hope that the pain of dealing with the financial consequences of the pandemic in the UK are shared appropriately and equitably.There will be many who suffered during that much-discussed decade referred to who will share the views of Ernest Bevin in , when leader of the transport workers, when at a time of financial crisis he was resisting a % cut in unemployment benefit, who then said: \"City must not be saved at the expense of the working class.\"Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.WHEN we emerge from this hellish Coronavirus experience, the true financial cost to Scotland of coping must be revealed. I have no doubt the figure will confirm that had Scotland been independent, an SNP Government would have been totally financially incapable, in addition to the existing dire state of the economy, to manage without massive financial aid.No matter what the final cost will be, supporters of separation will never admit the inability to cope financially, preferring Scots to exist in penury for decades just to prove a point and to achieve some sort of misguided ldquofreedom. I have no doubt that the cost will make even the most staunch nationalist agree that separation is as dead as Monty Pythonrsquos parrot.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.SNP MP Douglas Chapman used the pandemic to draw an inappropriate comparison on Twitter between the number of deaths from Covid- in Scotland and England He tweeted: \"Recorded deaths from #COVID in England are double the rate of Scotland\" and pondering whether \"NHS Scotlandrsquos vastly superior AE performance \" or \"Scotlandrsquos  unique coronavirus assessment centres\" are the cause. Leaving aside his questionable data interpretation, the tweet implicitly demeans the extraordinary efforts of NHS staff and care workers in England to save lives. While \"them and us\" politics are a hallmark of Scottish nationalism, surely the tragedy of death tolls shouldnt be crowed over by anyone ndash and certainly not a senior member of the SNP establishment Martin Redfern, Edinburgh EH.I NOTE with interest Ian Lakins grim prediction that \"the extra shared cost for the UK could be around pound trillion which would increase the national debt by  per cent .I am puzzled by his apparent conclusion that this admittedly huge ndash as yet only estimated ndash increase in the UKs national debt would impact only on poor wee Scotland, and not on the rest of the UK, despite the apparently higher incidence of the virus south of the Border to date.Would it not be wiser by far to wait to seesuch a development actually occurs before rushing to such an ideologically motivated assumption Ian O Bayne, Glasgow G.THE World Health Organisation last week, in response to rumours that British American Tobaccowas developing a Covid- vaccine, said that ldquopartnership with the tobacco industry undermines governmentsrsquo credibility in protecting the population\" as there is \"a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict between the tobacco industryrsquos interests and public health policy interests.The tobacco industry ldquointerests have been accused of both knowingly driving addiction in developing countries and misrepresenting theof filters. This week we learn that BAT faces charges of sanctions busting. Why do we tolerate this awful industry that causes people to take up scarce hospital beds which could be displacing people with conditions that are not self-inflicted Given Covid- targets the lungs, itrsquos not a big leap to suggest that smokers are likely to be disproportionately affected once they catch this damnable virus. If we are not allowed out to play why are we still allowed to buy tobacco  This paradox is the freedom too far. With Covid- a worldwide scourge, there has never been a better time for the world to ban all tobacco production and turn the fields and the resources over to food production.John Dunlop, Ayr.WITH the country in lockdown, much of le is on hold and the nation waits for signs of salvation from the coronavirus crisis. Rays of hope shine out in the manest humanity responding to those most vulnerable to distress.At the fore of this are Sikhs in Scotland, who launched a major new initiative, the Sikh Food Bank, to address the growing needs of the vulnerable and elderly. Scotlandrsquos eight Gurdwaras, which normally serve more than , meals per week, were shuttered following Scottish Government advice to ban mass gatherings and to close all places of worship. This was especially dficult for Scottish Sikhs as these are normally a joyous few weeks where we would be celebrating Vaisakhi, the annual festival which marks the establishment of the Sikh Nation. Glasgow-dwellers will recall the distinctive procession of thousands of people dressed in vibrant colours singing through the streets of Glasgow, in the traditional Nagar Kirtan procession. This yearrsquos th Nagar Kirtan was cancelled for the first time ever such are the unique circumstances.The Sikh spirit of selfless service, or Seva, is a foundational belief. It was this which inspired the Sikh Food Bank ndash a network of volunteers who buy, package and deliver emergency food parcels to vulnerable people to their doorsteps.The Sikh Food Bank, driven by volunteers, utilises Gurdwara buildings to distribute emergency food parcels, provide hot meals and contact the vulnerable through a multi-lingual helpline. Taking inspiration from Guru Nanak, who established the Langar free kitchen, the Sikh Food Bank serves all communities, regardless of background or religion. The daily prayer of the Sikhs ends with a supplication ldquowe pray for the well-being of the whole of humanity ndash I cannot think of more apt words for these times.Charandeep Singh, Executive Director, Sikhs in Scotland, Glasgow G.MY daughter is an AE consultant putting her own and her familys lives on the line against the virus.

Even with thoughts of lugging heavy panniers full of day-to-day necessary detritus.Even knowing Id have to scrap with private hire drivers at junctions and dodge buses in cycle lanes.Thats a large part of the current joy. No scrapping, no narrow misses, no stress.The roads are so much emptier that the nagging fear always following at my shoulder, that heightened sense of potential doom, is gone.There are streets so quiet on my route that you can almost forget about motorised traffic and freewheel, carefree up the middle of the road. It is glorious.Even in the centre of the city the roads are largely silent. While its eerie, definitely, for the cyclist it is exciting. The roads are mine.Elsewhere, children cycle along with their parents, in that zig zaggy way little kids do, unfussed about straight lines. Older couples cycle side by side, leisurely, having a lovely time.Its not only the newfound freedom of space that makes the roads more enticing, its the lack of noise. Theres a nice silence, easy on the ears. Birdsong is more pronounced.Of course, its not all utopia. There are still idiots treating the almost empty roads as a racetrack challenge and lets hope these chumps feel the force of the law. Police forces in some parts of the UK have said the number of motorists exceeding speed limits has doubled since the start of the coronavirus lockdown.But, broadly, we are being given a glimpse of what cycling cities could look like. Its being widely reported that the sales of bikes are up. Cycling Scotlands figures show that in some areas the number of cyclists has doubled or more.Other countries have seen similar increases in cycling and have seized the opportunity to make cities more bike and foot friendly. Cities in Germany are turning roads into bike lanes to help people with social distancing.Road layouts have been adapted with relative ease using removable tape and mobile signs. The redesign of urban spaces helps everyone as it takes pressure off parks as people take their exercise on the roads, and gives more space to pedestrians trying to keep their two metre distance by stepping into the road.London is also looking at repurposing space on its busiest roads to make more room for cyclists and pedestrians. This is the perfect time for Scotland to do the same.There will be plenty of people tempted by cycling but who are afraid of going on the roads, given how congested they usually are.Novice cyclists are not now competing with as much traffic and so its the perfect time to gain confidence, find routes that work for them and develop a healthy habit that they wont want to kick when the lockdown lts.It also plans to reduce speed limits across the city. Were seeing, right now, what a car free city centre could look like. And its pretty glorious, as long as we have the public transport network to support it.Could we also introduce reduced speed limits  Cycling is a safe mode of transport - the danger comes from external forces and, even in lockdown, drivers are still putting their foot down and making roads less safe. If we could further curb that with an increase in mph zones, what a dference it would make to the feel of the roads.Deep rooted health inequalities dont go away during lockdown people still have diseases linked with inactivity.Cars destroy health - at an inidual and societal level. They destroy the environment.There are so many sound and sensible reasons for pushing active travel and cutting car use - we know them well already.The dference now is that this is such an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of lightening the vehicular load on our roads.The means of creating wider pavements and segregated cycle lanes are easy to do, simple toto normal when lockdown lts. This, though, is a point for and a point against.Its hard to argue against simple, easily reversible measures. But when the pandemic is over we want to keep people using active travel. Hopefully, having had so many more people using cycling as a means of getting around, there will be wider support for current cycling strategies.Maybe there will be a push to take them further.It would be a great shame to see the current enthusiasm for cycling wane as lockdown is lted.It is joyous to see families cycling together, couples out on the roads, novice cyclists confidently owning the tarmac - all with reduced fear of vehicles.It is joyous to cycle fear-free down the middle of a road. It is a boost to mental and physical health, the fresh air, the bird song, the pure pleasure of physically activity.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

This allowed the SAMS team to measure one of these eddies in detail.While this particular eddyrsquos surface temperature was similar to the surrounding water, masking it from satellites, its lower salt content made it stand out in the glider readings.Dr Marie Porter, a SAMS oceanographer and lead author on a report about the discovery,published in Geophysical Research Letters, said her findings had implications for understanding the distribution of nutrients that fuel the entire Arctic ecosystem.She said: ldquoWe get a pretty good idea about whatrsquos happening on the very surface of our ocean through satellites but eddies like this one have been hidden from view because they have warmed at the surface since leaving the Arctic.ldquoThis temperature masking means we have previously underestimated how much water moves within these patches in the Arctic Seas. It begs the question: how many more of these hidden eddies are occurring in the ocean today The water column of the Barents Sea has a seemingly simple structure where water from the Atlantic dominates in the south but in the north it is overlain by fresher, less dense water from the Arctic.This Arctic water is largely devoid of the nutrients required to fuel the growth of phytoplankton, which is key to maintaining le in the ocean.In contrast the Atlantic Water is one of the key pathways of nutrient rich water into the Arctic.Dr Porter added: ldquoHow these eddies affect this exchange is something we need to investigatewe are to truly understand the ocean ecosystem there.Arctic oceanographer Prof Finlo Cottier of SAMS, a co-author on the paper, said: ldquoSAMS has been working with ocean gliders for over a decade and we know that they are the ideal tool for measuring the detailed properties of the ocean.\"This work gives us precise measurements of important structures in the Arctic that we couldnrsquot previously obtain.The discovery was made during a two-week trial of the glider lsquoZephyrrsquo in July , ahead of a longer mission as part of the Arctic PRIZE project, funded by the Natural Environment Research Councilrsquos Changing Arctic Ocean programme."},{"url":null,"title":"town-brings-spirit-wigtown-book-festival-homes","story":"Now, with physical bookshops forced to shutter for the time being, the cherished town is bringing its literary sensibilities directly to readers.Wigtown Book Festival has launched a series of online events allowing book fans to embrace literature from the comfort of their homes.Coined #WigtownWednesdays, the festivalrsquos virtual line-up kicked off this week as more than  people gathered in their homes to listen to broadcaster and Sunday Times bestselling author Sally Magnusson discussing her new novel The Ninth Child.Future #WigtownWednesdays will feature adventurer Robert Twigger on Walking The Great North Line and philosopher Julian Baggini on lessons from a crisis.There are even plans for a virtual version of the Wigtownrsquos Got Talent competition, and there will also be the chance to take part in Stuart Kellyrsquos literary pub quiz, which is one of the most popular events of the annual book festival.And a monthly virtual bookclub will hold its first get-togethernext Wednesday.Those who join in will be able to virtually meet author of the memoir Native, Patrick Laurie ndash a Dumfries and Galloway-based conservation hill farmer.

the end of every weekend, which is, that car use gets very, very low over the weekend on a Monday or in this case on Tuesday it comes back up again.\"Its about on levels where it was the week before

travel industry, which accused him of ldquoundermining confidence in it after he revealed he had no plans to book a summer holiday.Asked on BBC Radio s Today programme about consumers being unsure whether to book a trip, the Cabinet minister replied: \"I wont be booking a summer holiday at this point, lets put it that way.\"He added people would \"want to see what the trajectory of this disease is in the next few weeks\".But Abta, which represents UK travel firms, issued a withering response to Mr Shappsrsquos remarks.It said: \"It was a thoughtless comment and not based on any facts about what we know today about the future of the pandemic, but it shows complete disregard for the UK travel industry, the hundreds of thousands of people it employs and the struggle it is facing in this current crisis.\"It would be betterthe Government focused on taking the necessary steps to support the sector rather than undermining confidence in it.\"Downing Street also suggested summer holidays should not be booked yet as there is no certainty of when travel can resume.Boris Johnsonrsquos spokesman said: \"As of today, it is a fact that both the guidelines and the official Foreign Office advice do not allow for people going on holidays.\"Abta has warned that many travel firms will not be able to survive unless the Government amends refund rules.Under EU law, travel companies must refund customers within  daystheir package holiday is cancelled.But Abta says the deluge of claims means many firms will collapsethey are forced to pay out cash refunds.It wants the Government to

are not allowed due to the Governments lockdown orders issued six days later.These measures have hit travel firms hard, with trips being cancelled and many people delaying making future bookings.A number of companies have furloughed staff due to the sector grinding to a halt.Mr Shapps said the Government \"wont be able to save every single business in every single circumstance\" but predicted

Jonathan van Tam, its Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor, the new team will have representatives from government, academia and industry.They will include Sir John Bell, the Government Le Sciences Champion, as well as AstraZeneca, the leading biopharmaceutical company, and the Wellcome Trust research charity.It will use a pound million fund to drive forward, expedite and co-ordinate efforts to research and then produce a coronavirus vaccine, making sure one is made available to the public as quickly as possible.Among the  projects making up the taskforce will be researchers at Edinburgh University, who will play a vital role, enabling the tracking of the spread of the virus in almost real time.Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, said: ldquoScotland has world-leading universities and I am pleased they are able to use their expertise to help us understand more about this deadly virus.Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, who announced the new taskforce at the daily Downing St briefing, admitted developing a vaccine was a \"colossal undertaking\".He said it was a complex process that would take many months and accepted there were no guarantees.\"But, he added, ldquothe Government is backing our scientists, betting big to maximise the chance of success.\"The Taskforce will focus on five strands of activity including:*supporting the discovery of potential coronavirus vaccines by working with the public and private sector, rapidly mobilising funding, supporting leading academics and identying ways to fast-track clinical trials*preparing the UK as a leader in clinical vaccine testing and manufacturing, working with companies already at the forefront of vaccine development*reviewing Government regulations to facilitate rapid and safe vaccine trials*developing funding and operational plans for the procurement and delivery of vaccines and*building on the UKrsquos research and development expertise to support international efforts to find a coronavirus vaccine.Mr Sharma pointed to how the Government was speeding up the creation of the UKrsquos first vaccines manufacturing centre based in Harwell near Oxford.\"We are looking forward, so, when we do make a breakthrough, we are ready to manufacture by the millions, insisted the Secretary of State.But Sir Patrick introduced what he described as ldquosome realism in the search for a vaccine, declaring: ldquoEach single project does not have a high probability of success.\"So, although everyone goes out with great enthusiasm and we hope they work, its never the case that you know youve got a vaccine thats going to work.\"So thats the first thing that we need to be sure of. The second thing is then the safety and its incredibly important that these vaccines are tested properly, thats why it takes some time to get to the clinical trials and understand the potential unwanted effects of a vaccine.\"And then only when that has been done can this be used widely across the population and so those are the stages we need to go through,\" he explained.The Edinburgh University project will be led by Professor Aziz Sheikh. Using anonymised electronic health records, including GP and hospital visits and test results, from .m people in Scotland, his team will track the progress of the Covid- epidemic in near real-time.They will also process blood samples and swabs of the virus taken from a sub-sample of the participants to determine who has been exposed and to sequence the virus genomes. If vaccines or anti-viral therapies become available, their effectiveness will be monitored.Meanwhile, more than  patients across NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with coronavirus have started to receive potential treatments for the disease.It is thought the RECOVERY clinical trial is one of the fastest programmes looking at such a treatment.All patients with Covid- being treated at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Inverclyde Royal Hospital and Royal Alexandra Hospital will be offered a place on the trial.The randomised-controlled trial has so far involved  patients being given an active drug or standard care including steroids, antivirals and antimalarial agents.Dr Jenner Armstrong, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clydemedical director, welcomed the move saying: \"Our teams have been incredible in rising up to the challenge of Covid-.\"Not just in the care and treatment of patients but also their dedication to improving our knowledge of the virus through clinical trials.\"This means our patients are receiving the most up to date treatment available.\"Although the NHSGGC clinical trial involves experts from the University of Edinburgh, RECOVERY is running separately from the institutes STOPCOVID project involving up to  researchers.Oxford University staff are also involved in the Glasgow-based UK-wide study which is funded by the UK Government.Professor Julie Brittenden, NHSGGC research and development director, said: \"I want to thank all of our staff for their efforts during this incredibly challenging time.\"Our research, development and innovation teams are working hard to improve the diagnosis and treatment of Covid-.\"Weve been able to rapidly mobilise our teams to take part in clinical trials like RECOVERY and this is a testament to their dedication to the cause.\"Charles Weller, general manager at NHS Research Scotland, said: \"RECOVERY has been the fastest growing clinical trial in medical history - and a crucial part of our efforts to better understand and tackle Covid-.\"I want to thank all teams for their commitment and professionalism to this national priority study.\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : pmA call for urgent changes to the planned support for self-employed people has been made by Orkney and Shetland MP, Alistair Carmichael. “This week I am challenging the Chancellor to do more for the self-employed,# said Mr Carmichael, today, Friday. #It is obvious now that the measures announced to date are not sufficient and that [hellip]copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, the RSPB says these birds are in serious trouble, with numbers plummeting in former strongholds across the UK and Europe. It is reported that the species is now vulnerable to extinction.Puffarazzi aims to find out what is causing population changes across the UK, particularly focusing on dferences in food availability related to climate change. People can join the Puffarazzi by submitting photos from visits to puffin colonies in previous years where they have snapped pictures of these colourful seabirds with food in their bills. The photos help scientists learn more about what puffins are feeding their chicks, or ‘pufflings’, and how this might have changed over time.The project first ran in  asking for photos from that summer, before ing last year with the added request for images from any year which will help build a picture of how food sources might have changed over time.The RSPB says the public response in the previous two years has been incredible:This year the project is adapting to take coronavirus guidance into account, asking people to focus on digging through their photo albums and files at home in case there are any photos tucked away from previous visits to puffin colonies that could be of use.The photos will help scientists identy areas where puffins are struggling to find enough nutritious fish needed to support their pufflings, with the historical photos providing an invaluable comparison of how food availability has changed over time.Connie Tremlett, RSPB conservation scientist and manager of the project this year, said: “We’ve been bowled over by how many people have already taken part in Puffarazzi # the response so far really shows how beloved these ‘clowns of the sea’ are, and how each and every one of us can play a part in saving them. As puffinsto our shores, we’re once again asking people to share their photos from previous years with us. However old your photo is, as long as it has a picture of a puffin with food in its beak, and you know when and where it was taken, it will help.“Those who join the Puffarazzi are filling key gaps in our knowledge, helping us to understand what threats are facing these little seabirds. This is the first critical step to determining how to save them and ensure theyto our coasts for years to come.”Find out more about the project at: rspb.org.uk projectpuffincopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Actions by the Scottish Government are welcome but an integrated approach is needed.“In recent weeks I have spoken with self-employed people across the isles, representing every walk of le, and their message to the government could not be clearer: it is time for a rethink. Almost half of self-employed people are worried that they will not be able to cover basic costs like rent and bills.“We have learned that only two per cent of businesses have been able to access government-backed loans since they were introduced last month. If that is the situation for regular businesses it does not inspire a great deal of confidence in the coverage for self-employed people.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile. I was just at the very beginning of coming to an understanding of Gaelic culture, but there, with my hazy stumbling knowledge, I felt included.Such brief encounters can mean so much. – The Sufferings of Christ.

The couple share their Kensington Road home of  years with around  teddy bears of all shapes and sizes, collected over the past few decades.Having been encouraged by their four grandchildren, the couple came up with quirky presentations of the bears on their lawn, which is putting smiles on many faces, both young and old.In a bid to banish the boredom during their own self-isolation, Morrisand Jennyare keeping busy by meticulously arranging their daily displays, swapping bears in and out, giving their teddies dferent props, or moving them around the corner of the front garden.Behind it all is Jenny#s lelong love of teddy bears - she still has her very first bear Ted, given to her when she was just  months old. Morris did all the buying of the bears when he used to travel a lot for business, Jenny said.For  years he would always bring back a Harrods bear from London and they all sit on the stairs of our house. It became a tradition that when he would go away, he brought back a bear. Our kids and my brothers and sisters all bought bears for me down the years for Christmas and birthdays so we have accumulated a lot over the years.Alongside Brown Thomas bears sit several Paddingtons and others purchased at Aston Villa, Derby County, Wimbledon and ious Northern Ireland away games. Morris, however, called a halt to the bear buying  years ago once the teddy takeover became a bit too much. Now they take pride of place in the front garden each day, much to the delight of passers-by.What started off on day one as a small Teddy#s Bear Picnic has grown to much larger displays including a sports day, cricket match, Lego building, classroom scene, cycling trip, gardening and even a religious service on Easter Sunday. We began on day one with just four bears sitting out in the garden with tables and chairs and that was going to be it. But we got so many comments about it that we thought we#d better do something the next day, so it has grown from that, Morris said. The bears have a wee chat at night about what they want to do the next day and then let us know their plan in the morning so we try to accommodate them.We have had a constant stream of people coming past for a look every day. Until a few days ago we only knew a couple of our neighbours on both sides of the street, but now we#re meeting people we#ve never seen before. It has become a great talking point and people seem to look forward to it every day. The bears usually stay out until around  o#clock at night and then they all have to be put to bed. Thankfully the weather has been tremendous every day so far but we do have umbrellas, tents and gazebos in case of a rainy day.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Wayne Rodgers, a member of Magherafelt-based wedding band The Allstars, has been entertaining residents since lockdown brough an abrupt end to his normal work. “Everything has just fallen off a clf, it’s all stopped overnight,” he told the County Derry Post. “Mark Stewart, who runs a bar in Magherafelt, said some of the homes were askinghe could suggest anything entertainment-wise. “The Manor Nursing home [in Magherafelt] was the first one I did. They had me back so I couldn’t have been too bad!” googletag.cmd.push A driving instructor by day, Wayne says he wanted to bring the residents of the care homes a bit of joy at a time when they are not allowed to have visitors. He said: “I’m not an essential worker but I’m not doing anyone any harm. I’m there on my own and it’s entertainment for them and gives them something to look forward to.” “They throw a sterilised plug out the window to me and I plug that into my own equipment. There’s no contact made. “It breaks up my day. It’s as good for me as it is for them. You can hear them clapping and singing behind the windows. googletag.cmd.push  “It’s sad - some of the relatives would come and sit in cars. They can’t go in to see their parents. They can only wave through the window and it’s very tough on everybody, strained times. “Some of the homes are doing wee videos from inside and posting them online so the families can see them all enjoying themselves, singing and clapping along.” Wayne is now a man in demand as word spreads of his singing exploits, and has performances lined up both in his adopted County Derry and native town of Ballynahinch. He said: “We did one and then another got in touch. My brother in law arranged four in Ballynahinch on Monday, so I’ve done about ten now at this stage. “I don’t like forcing people or anything, but this week I’ve been asked back to a few I’ve done before because the residents are enjoying it so much. “I have another three lined up this week with a possibility of a few more coming on board.” The old classics are proving popular as Wayne does the rounds, with one song in particular being requested on every occasion. “They all seem to love Danny Boy,” he said. “It seems to bring back memories. A lot of the patients in the homes have dementia and it seems to be a song that takes them home. They like the classics, the ballads – all songs from their era.” Although the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, there was one voice of dissent who would have preferred not to have Wayne singing outside his window. “I got one negative comment. I was in Ballynahinch the other day and a man said ‘what’s your name son ’ So I answered and he said ‘well will you feck off, I can’t hear the TV!’ “He didn’t enjoy it as much as the others, but it gave everybody a laugh.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chhindwara in the state of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalia. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chhindwara. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in a local village. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chhindwara in the state of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalia. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chhindwara. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in a local village. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

They lost a NFL final to the Dubs, won three Ulster senior titles, losing a further two finals. It was a team that Mick ODwyer termed the greatest team never to win footballs top prize. Their example, inspired the generation coming after them. googletag.cmd.push But Derrys waves of success had already begun. St Columbs Derry won the MacRory and Hogan Cup in , the same year Tommy Diamond captained the Oaks minor crop to the Tom Markham Cup. An All-Ireland U followed three years later. It was natural progression. This success, needed inspiration to come from somewhere. Its about having an example to follow. They needed the earliest pioneers to put Derry football on the map. *** According to Derry GAAs history book, produced in , the first official county board meeting took place in September . All six clubs present have since dissolved, but of the  present at the start of , only Claudy and Foreglen exist to this day. St Patricks Waterside are credited by the Derry People with having the first team to represent the county, when they played Strabane in a game at Lford. After nine attempts to get the GAA fully operational, in a period that saw Derry win two Ulster hurling championships and reach four football finals, it wasnt here to stay until . Ulster Council official Benny Fay, of Cavan, organised an exhibition game between Newbridge and Ballinderry. After the game, the county board was formed of  officials, two from each club. In May that year, Derry beat Antrim in the opening round of the Ulster junior championship, before beating Tyrone in the semi-final, but they lost to Donegal in the decider. Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board. By , the county had entered its first minor team which would supply seven players to the senior team who began the building process. It also contained future GAA President Paddy McFlynn. It wasnt until the s that titles began to regularly arrive. It was a spell when Derry won the Ulster junior championship, the now defunct Dr Lagan Cup , the Dr McKenna Cup and pride of place - the  NFL title.   NFL Champions From that team, goalkeeper Charlie Moran, Sonny McCann, John Eddie Mullan, Mickey McNaught and Roddy Gribbin would form the spine of a team that took Derry into the next decade. They reached the league semi-final of , only to be narrowly beaten by All-Ireland champions Meath. The same year, a strong junior team lost to Mayo in the All-Ireland final and three years later, the seniors pushed a star-studded Cavan team all the way in a league game. The momentum was building with every passing year. In , Derry beat Armagh in the Dr McKenna Cup, just nine months after the Orchard side had contested an All-Ireland final with Kerry. Twelve months later, in , a win over Armagh would see Derry contest their first Ulster senior final since . No longer was the top level of provincial football a one-game season, before being knocked out on their ear. Derry were beginning to challenge. In the decider, they came up against a Cavan team in search of their th title. Derry had seven of the team that would play in their first ever All-Ireland senior final four years later. They gave the Breffni men all they wanted before going down - to -. The winners had Peter ODonohue to thank for his display of accuracy from frees. Derry were getting closer and closer. The  season ended with another appearance in the final, this time going down to Tyrone by two points. Their time was just around the corner. *** The  season was the best in Derrys history, at the time, but it began in the unfamiliar surroundings under the Twin Towers of Wembley Stadium. The British GAA rented the iconic venue to host a tournament, known as Wembley at Whit. It became a hit and lasted until the s. Derry took the field before Galway, in front of an attendance of ,, making them the first ever GAA team to step on the hallowed Wembley turf. The Tribesmen lted Sam two years earlier and ran out eight point winners over a Derry team on the rise. The  season saw Derry win both the Dr McKenna and the Dr Lagan Cups. It was on the championship stage where they laid their greatest stamp. Derry opened with a narrow three-point win over neighbours Antrim at Casement Park. It was all the more signicant, as the Oakleafers had to come from behind in the closing stages. It set up a clash with Cavan in the semi-final, who took three games to get over Monaghan. Derry started sluggishly against the Ulster kingpins before pulling away to book their place in the final. It was a novel pairing with Derry and Down both vying for a first title. It was manager Roddy Gribbins side who came out on the right side of the battle in Clones . The Ulster champions were now poised for an All-Ireland semi-final clash with Kerry. Before that, Derry played the Dr McKenna Cup final in early August, something that would be unheard of now. They hammered Armagh - to -. *** It set Derry up for the biggest game in their history. After years challenging at All-Ireland junior level, this was the pinnacle. And it was Kerry standing in their way. In their ranks were newcomers Mick ODwyer at wing back and Mick OConnell in attack. On a tricky day for football, the Kingdom began with the first of two Tadhgie Lyne goals and led - to -. By half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead. The Oakleafers matched a fancied Kerry side every step of the way and went into a four point lead before Lyne grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on in the final moments to book their place in the final on a - to - scoreline. It was time to challenge for Sam. Derry were a young side, but benefited from the experience and nous of manager Roddy Gribbin, who would come on later in the final, to bring down the curtain on a  year senior career. The Dubs were primed after losing the  final to Kerry and nine of the starting team were back, including Kevin Heffernan, Paddy Haughey and ace free-taker Ollie Freaney. Dublin had the wind at their backs and attacked the Hill  end in the first half. Haugheys control on the ground set up Heffo for a point to settle down the home side. It took an angled kick from Brendan Murray to get the Oaks off the mark. But back came Dublin and led - to - at one point in the first half, with Freaney and John Timmons doing much of the damage. Derry began to find their feet, but were wasteful in front of goal. Up popped Dinny McKeever to notch their second point, before two Sean OConnell points had his side within a goal of the Dubs. The interval lead was - to -. OConnell was on target early in the second half, but Derry needed a Patsy Gormley save to deny full-forward Johnny Joyce.  The build-up to Owen Gribbins goal Another OConnell free had Derry back to within the kick of a ball. Then they were level. Twenty-five years before Downeys fisted goal, Derry were again attacking the Railway goals. Owen Gribbin did the spadework earlier in the move. Chuck Higgins and Brian Mullan went close in a goalmouth scramble before Owen Gribbin finished to the net. The sides were level - to -. They needed a break to swing their control into something that would ask questions of Dublin. Their brief glimmer of hope was quashed when Des Ferguson goaled for Dublin shortly after. The changing of the game as the introduction of Maurice Whelan to the Dublin defence, allowing Lar Foley to push towards midfield where he negated the influence of Jim McKeever. A second Dublin goal pushed the margin to eight points, but OConnell and Owen Gribbin, with a fisted effort, rounded off the scoring, but Dublin were - to - wi nners. McKeevers performances in the All-Ireland series saw him awarded the first Texaco award for player of the year. Later in the season, Derry completed the treble of Ulster titles by seeing off Donegal in the final of the Dr Lagan Cup. It couldve been a perfect season, but instead it laid the foundations for the success that followed.

They lost a NFL final to the Dubs, won three Ulster senior titles, losing a further two finals. It was a team that Mick ODwyer termed the greatest team never to win footballs top prize. Their example, inspired the generation coming after them. googletag.cmd.push But Derrys waves of success had already begun. St Columbs Derry won the MacRory and Hogan Cup in , the same year Tommy Diamond captained the Oaks minor crop to the Tom Markham Cup. An All-Ireland U followed three years later. It was natural progression. This success, needed inspiration to come from somewhere. Its about having an example to follow. They needed the earliest pioneers to put Derry football on the map. *** According to Derry GAAs history book, produced in , the first official county board meeting took place in September . All six clubs present have since dissolved, but of the  present at the start of , only Claudy and Foreglen exist to this day. St Patricks Waterside are credited by the Derry People with having the first team to represent the county, when they played Strabane in a game at Lford. After nine attempts to get the GAA fully operational, in a period that saw Derry win two Ulster hurling championships and reach four football finals, it wasnt here to stay until . Ulster Council official Benny Fay, of Cavan, organised an exhibition game between Newbridge and Ballinderry. After the game, the county board was formed of  officials, two from each club. In May that year, Derry beat Antrim in the opening round of the Ulster junior championship, before beating Tyrone in the semi-final, but they lost to Donegal in the decider. Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board. By , the county had entered its first minor team which would supply seven players to the senior team who began the building process. It also contained future GAA President Paddy McFlynn. It wasnt until the s that titles began to regularly arrive. It was a spell when Derry won the Ulster junior championship, the now defunct Dr Lagan Cup , the Dr McKenna Cup and pride of place - the  NFL title.   NFL Champions From that team, goalkeeper Charlie Moran, Sonny McCann, John Eddie Mullan, Mickey McNaught and Roddy Gribbin would form the spine of a team that took Derry into the next decade. They reached the league semi-final of , only to be narrowly beaten by All-Ireland champions Meath. The same year, a strong junior team lost to Mayo in the All-Ireland final and three years later, the seniors pushed a star-studded Cavan team all the way in a league game. The momentum was building with every passing year. In , Derry beat Armagh in the Dr McKenna Cup, just nine months after the Orchard side had contested an All-Ireland final with Kerry. Twelve months later, in , a win over Armagh would see Derry contest their first Ulster senior final since . No longer was the top level of provincial football a one-game season, before being knocked out on their ear. Derry were beginning to challenge. In the decider, they came up against a Cavan team in search of their th title. Derry had seven of the team that would play in their first ever All-Ireland senior final four years later. They gave the Breffni men all they wanted before going down - to -. The winners had Peter ODonohue to thank for his display of accuracy from frees. Derry were getting closer and closer. The  season ended with another appearance in the final, this time going down to Tyrone by two points. Their time was just around the corner. *** The  season was the best in Derrys history, at the time, but it began in the unfamiliar surroundings under the Twin Towers of Wembley Stadium. The British GAA rented the iconic venue to host a tournament, known as Wembley at Whit. It became a hit and lasted until the s. Derry took the field before Galway, in front of an attendance of ,, making them the first ever GAA team to step on the hallowed Wembley turf. The Tribesmen lted Sam two years earlier and ran out eight point winners over a Derry team on the rise. The  season saw Derry win both the Dr McKenna and the Dr Lagan Cups. It was on the championship stage where they laid their greatest stamp. Derry opened with a narrow three-point win over neighbours Antrim at Casement Park. It was all the more signicant, as the Oakleafers had to come from behind in the closing stages. It set up a clash with Cavan in the semi-final, who took three games to get over Monaghan. Derry started sluggishly against the Ulster kingpins before pulling away to book their place in the final. It was a novel pairing with Derry and Down both vying for a first title. It was manager Roddy Gribbins side who came out on the right side of the battle in Clones . The Ulster champions were now poised for an All-Ireland semi-final clash with Kerry. Before that, Derry played the Dr McKenna Cup final in early August, something that would be unheard of now. They hammered Armagh - to -. *** It set Derry up for the biggest game in their history. After years challenging at All-Ireland junior level, this was the pinnacle. And it was Kerry standing in their way. In their ranks were newcomers Mick ODwyer at wing back and Mick OConnell in attack. On a tricky day for football, the Kingdom began with the first of two Tadhgie Lyne goals and led - to -. By half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead. The Oakleafers matched a fancied Kerry side every step of the way and went into a four point lead before Lyne grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on in the final moments to book their place in the final on a - to - scoreline. It was time to challenge for Sam. Derry were a young side, but benefited from the experience and nous of manager Roddy Gribbin, who would come on later in the final, to bring down the curtain on a  year senior career. The Dubs were primed after losing the  final to Kerry and nine of the starting team were back, including Kevin Heffernan, Paddy Haughey and ace free-taker Ollie Freaney. Dublin had the wind at their backs and attacked the Hill  end in the first half. Haugheys control on the ground set up Heffo for a point to settle down the home side. It took an angled kick from Brendan Murray to get the Oaks off the mark. But back came Dublin and led - to - at one point in the first half, with Freaney and John Timmons doing much of the damage. Derry began to find their feet, but were wasteful in front of goal. Up popped Dinny McKeever to notch their second point, before two Sean OConnell points had his side within a goal of the Dubs. The interval lead was - to -. OConnell was on target early in the second half, but Derry needed a Patsy Gormley save to deny full-forward Johnny Joyce.  The build-up to Owen Gribbins goal Another OConnell free had Derry back to within the kick of a ball. Then they were level. Twenty-five years before Downeys fisted goal, Derry were again attacking the Railway goals. Owen Gribbin did the spadework earlier in the move. Chuck Higgins and Brian Mullan went close in a goalmouth scramble before Owen Gribbin finished to the net. The sides were level - to -. They needed a break to swing their control into something that would ask questions of Dublin. Their brief glimmer of hope was quashed when Des Ferguson goaled for Dublin shortly after. The changing of the game as the introduction of Maurice Whelan to the Dublin defence, allowing Lar Foley to push towards midfield where he negated the influence of Jim McKeever. A second Dublin goal pushed the margin to eight points, but OConnell and Owen Gribbin, with a fisted effort, rounded off the scoring, but Dublin were - to - wi nners. McKeevers performances in the All-Ireland series saw him awarded the first Texaco award for player of the year. Later in the season, Derry completed the treble of Ulster titles by seeing off Donegal in the final of the Dr Lagan Cup. It couldve been a perfect season, but instead it laid the foundations for the success that followed.

Seonaidh Mullan, who played camogie and ladies’ football for Ballerin, ran a STEM cell registration event following her diagnosis to encourage people to register as donors. The event, hosted at the GAA club in Ballerin, resulted in over  donors registering as potential lesavers. Camogie club Chairperson Melinda Robinson said many in the community were grieving the loss of a friend. “Seonaidh was an extremely private person, very modest. There was no fuss with her. She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the death of the -year-old journalist in Creggan last April. Detectives from the PSNI’s Major Investigation Team investigating the murder of Lyra have issued an appeal ahead of the anniversary. The Senior Investigating Officer has sent letters to people living in Creggan directly appealing to them to think back to the tragic events of a year ago and bring any new information forward to police. Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation, said: “On Saturday,  months will have passed since journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead during rioting at Fanad Drive in Creggan. googletag.cmd.push Sadly Lyra’s mum died very recently without seeing justice for her daughter. While this appeal for information is being distributed by the police, it is also a direct appeal from the McKee family for help in getting justice for Lyra. “The community as a whole was devastated by Lyra’s murder. Condemnation of her killing was unequivocal. That condemnation brought support for the community’s response from countries across the world.” In his letter sent to Creggan residents, Detective Superintendent Murphy said: “Since Lyra was killed, many of you may have spoken with my team of detectives. We have strived to conduct the investigation with sensitivity and care. My investigation is being carried out with the community and this has enabled us to gather important evidence which has resulted in one man being charged with Lyra’s murder and a second man being charged with offences connected to the rioting which preceded it. googletag.cmd.push “My sincere thanks go to all those who have helped to date. “However, these charges do not signy the end of the investigation. For the police service, me and my team of detectives it is only the beginning. A huge amount of work has been done and massive amounts of community help has enabled us to piece together the events of  April  and gain a clear understanding of the roles played by those who were involved. “Lyra’s murder was not committed in isolation, nor did it involve only one person. The events that led up to Lyra being shot, and the events afterwards, are equally important. I am asking the community to reach into its conscience and tell us what it knows. Lyra’s family cannot begin the grieving process without the information about Lyra’s murder that they deserve. Anybody in their position would want the same. “One year on, I am still seeking the evidence to bring every single person who was involved that night to justice. I cannot deliver that without you. Specically I want to: Gather mobile phone footage or photographs from anyone who was there that nightSpeak to anyone who was present and who can identy those involved in the disorderSpeak to anyone who can provide first-hand evidence relating to the events which preceded or followed Lyra’s murderRecover the gun that killed Lyra“We have made the public portal available again, so that you can contact us discreetly.

Castledawson man Dean McErlean made the discovery while walking his dogs at the foot of the Moyola River, where it enters Lough Neagh. “It says ‘Joseph McManmoy’ on it,” he told the County Derry Post. “We would take the dogs down there for a walk and let them swim and we found it lying in the sand. It was half-buried but I saw the top of it. “It doesn’t look like a medicine bottle – it’s clear. I knew it was old glass because you could still see the bubbles in it, and it wasn’t symmetrical. googletag.cmd.push “I knew it was a good age, but I didn’t know what it was for, whether it was for whiskey or medicine or anything.” Dean then took to the internet to seehe could unearth any details about the mysterious ‘Joseph McManmoy’, but his search drew a blank. “The first thing I did was Google it, but there was absolutely nothing and no name the same. It’s not a usual name. “The name has thrown everybody that I have asked because it’s so unusual.” The search for any trace of the name is still ongoing, but Dean has ensured the bottle has found a safe home. googletag.cmd.push He said: “An aunty of mine is big into traditional, vintage, oddly shaped stuff. “She would have wee medicine bottles and stuff around the house, so I took it home to her. She loved it, she was like an excited child.” While his efforts to find Mr McManmoy have not yet proved fruitful, Dean has his own theory about how the bottle came to rest on the Loughshore. “I would say it has come down the Moyola and washed out in the floods over the wintertime. God knows how long it was lying somewhere .”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In response to the Covid- pandemic, food is being delivered every week to households in need across the city as a result of the link-up between Apex Housing Association and the charity Fareshare. The surplus food supplies, collected by Fareshare from local supermarkets including Tesco and Asda, are being delivered by Apex to four areasof the city – Ballyarnett, Foyleside, The Moor and Waterside. Emergency food parcels and hot meals are also being distributed by local groups. googletag.cmd.push Donna Matthewson, Apex Director of Housing, said they were delighted with how the initiative was operating. “Over the last number of years we have developed an excellent relationship with Fareshare, delivering fresh food to eleven local charities on an on-going basis,” she said. “Recently we have seen the impact Covid- has had on families in this city and this new service with Fareshare has been established as a result. “We are delighted to be able to assist in redirecting these vital food supplies to those who need them most. “Feedback from community groups has been fantastic and we hope to continue this service for the duration of the pandemic.” googletag.cmd.push Ciara Ferguson from Greater Shantallow Area Partnership praised the food delivery scheme. “This service has allowed us to provide much needed food parcels for those who have negatively impacted by the Covid- crisis. “The food is of great quality and iety and the extra help means the world to our local families whose incomes have been reduced as a result of the pandemic.” If you or someone you know is struggling to afford or access food during the Covid- pandemic, contact your local DEA partnership office:Outer North-   Outer West-   Triax-   Waterside-     If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is the latest jinx in a long series of mishaps which have bedevilled the garage proprietor.The Rice family moved to Drumaness in what seemed the final chapter in a long running wrangle over a smoke problem at their home in Carlisle Park, Ballynahinch.The fire destroyed almost everything and it was in response to the ldquoraw deal which Mr Rice was getting that the Drumaness committee was formed.The Drumaness Community Action Committee is only eight-strong, but a spokesman pointed out that they had the backing of the whole community.A collection was taken around the Drumaness district last week and raised more than pound for Mr Rice. Since then donations have been pouring in and already another pound has been collected.The spokesman added: ldquoWe think he [Mr Rice] is getting a raw deal and we are determined to do something about it.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Work is well underway on a pound, environmental improvement scheme for Ballynahinch Square.The scheme, which will give the much-maligned square a major facelt, has been brought about after much pressure from the local chamber of commerce.The chamber has been pushing for the resurfacing of the square for over a decade, but the breakthrough didnrsquot occur until late last year when negotiations between the owners, the Ker Estate, and the Department of the Environment were finally completed.The scheme will entail the resurfacing of the square, the planting of shrubs, the building of a lsquositting wallrsquo and the re-use of flower boxes. It is expected to be completed within several months.NEWCASTLE mdash The Northern Ireland Tourist Board is to pump pound, into Newcastlersquos Harry Ferguson Festival this summer.Newcastle Town Committee, organisers of the festival, were pleased to hear of the Boardrsquos agreement to sponsor entertainment at a cost of pound, when they met last week.More than half of this amount, which was requested by the Town Committee, will go towards bandstand entertainment.However, the committee also discussed a reply from Down District Council regarding pound, assistance towards the festival. They noted with regret that the council was again unable to give them any support.The committee agreed there was great interest in the town on their ambitious plans, particularly the initiative to build a replica of the Ferguson monoplane, and it was agreed that an appeal for funds to local businesses, hotels and guest houses would have to be made in the near future.Mr Fergusonrsquos daughter will be coming to Newcastle on July and it is hoped she will attend the Miss Newcastle ball, which will be held in the Slieve Donard Hotel that night, and the festival parade the following day.DOWNPATRICK mdash A call has been made this week for the public to help stamp out vandalism in the Downpatrick area.It comes from Downpatrick councillor, Mr Cecil Maxwell, who felt he had to speak out after three incidents at Downpatrick Cathedral last week when excrement was littered around the building.ldquoIt is sad that a holy place is vandalised, especially in Holy Week, he said. ldquoThe time has come for the general public to stop this sheer vandalism.Appealing for more co-operation from the public with the police, Mr Maxwell pointed out that other churches and schools in the area had also suffered severely at the hands of vandals.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar Choral Societyrsquos ninth annual concert, Sing A Rainbow, will be presented next Tuesday and Wednesday in the War Memorial Hall, Crossgar.Such is the standard of this musical event that the society plays to full houses every year and there is no doubt that this yearrsquos production will be correspondingly attended.

I liked the balance of having the occasional day at home and the rest of the week in the office.ldquoI think the boys are definitely happy at having mummy home all the time and we all are enjoying that but they miss their school friends.

He also rode many to finish either second or third during the season.The original fixture list for  is now null and void so the original dates for Downpatrick and Down Royal, when we hopefully get back to normal sooner than later, will be all change to those originally sent out to members.An interesting fact that I learned with interest at the weekend was that Willie Robinson, who rode Laffy to win the  Ulster National at Downpatrick for the Queen Mother, was retained by Major John Corbett of Tyrella to ride for him.This was in the s before he moved to England as stable jockey to Fulke Walwyn. O course Laffy was stabled at Major Corbettrsquos establishment prior to running in the Ulster National, being trained in England by Peter Cazalet.With no racing in Ireland or England at the present time, it is a good chance to do some reading and a book just recently published, The Story of Dundalk Stadium, is a must for local racing fans.As most people know Dundalk mdash always thought about as the third local track, despite being in Co Louth mdash holds some great memories for locals, too many to record here.A feature by Frankie Fitzsimons is most interesting and he recalls the day that his father and namesake, brother Brian and himself, all rose in the famous Sweet Afton Hunters Chase back in .Frankie senior finished fth on Royal Knight, now owned by Tom Kerr from Ballygowan, while Brian rode Satin Link, also owned by Kerr, whose colours were red with the initials THK on them. Frankie finished third on Bright Cottage in the colours of Brightrsquos Arnold Ennis, who at that stage was a farmer but later turned his farm into a popular golf club.The book records that Frankie senior won the Sweet Afton in  on Fort Wayne, trained by Major John Corbett at Tyrella. He also rode Copper Cottage, trained beside Downpatrick Racecourse by Ned Altern in . He also won the race in  on Copper Ridge, like Copper Cottage owned by Major T W Hughes, this one also trained by Ned Altern. This race was won in  by Frigid Fox, owned by S J Martin from Ballynahinch and ridden by his son Raymond.In later years this race became known as the Tallanstown Hunters Chase and was won by Bald Joker in the colours of Christine McBratney and ridden by her brother-in-law Colin, now a trainer at Crossgar.Frankie Fitzsimons junior rode a few winners under rules, but the one that he will always recall was when he rode Palo to victory in the opening hurdle race of the day at Dundalk in , the horse being owned by the well known busy draper, Downpatrickrsquos Joe Rea, and trained by Peter McGreevy.Back in  owner trainer Tom McConnell, from Carsonstown, near Saintfield, and Darragh Cross amateur Barney Jones recorded their first ever success when successful with loving star in the bumper race.Barney told me recently that on their way that day they collected a lot of bets to place on the horse and as his mouth got dry when he rode he was sucking a sweet that stuck to the roof of his mouth at the start.In  Farranfad farmer and horse breeder Brian Kennedy pulled off a   shock when he saddled Star of Venosos in his green and white belt colours to win the valuable CarrollHandicap Hurdle under Harry Rodgers, now a trainer.This was Brianrsquos first ever success as a trainer and although he only held a licence for a short time he also saddled his charge to win the Ulster Cesarewitch at   at Downpatrick when,memory serves me correctly, it was ridden by Ards jockey Philip Lowry.Lots of other names like Miss K R Payne, Leslie Crawford, Willie Rooney, Jeremy Maxwell, Sammy Shields, Robin Kidd and Pat McAteer feature in the book that brings back some great memories of a popular course, no longer the same to some of us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

Clearly the vast majority of people heeded the advice they had been given, but there were a number of issues involving young people drinking together, the councillor continued.ldquoThe lsquostay at home messagersquo has got through but there is no room for complacency. We need to keep this up and while I appreciate that it is dficult and frustrating for many to stay at home and only venture outside for essential supplies, there will be light at the end of the tunnel.Cllr Clarke said while everyonersquos focus was on doing everything they could to stay safe, he believed that the pandemic will pass.ldquoWe all have a role to play to ensure that this happens as soon as possible, he said. ldquoPeople are yearning for ato normality, but we all need to play out part to ensure that this happens.Cllr Clarke said the impact of the lockdown was having a major impact on businesses in Newcastle who rely heavily upon tourism and who are suffering as a result of the current restrictions on businesses opening.ldquoBusiness has been devastated and I hope that those who have been forced to close will be provided with all the help and support they deserve moving forward, he continued.Cllr Clarke also praised all frontline NHS workers and Newry, Mourne and Down Council staff for continuing to deliver services in the face of the pandemic.He added: ldquoWe owe these people so much. They have stepped forward to help in their own respective fields and deserve our thanks.ldquoAll NHS staff have been fantastic as have local authority directors, who are working from home, and a number of other frontline staff. Refuse collection workers who have maintained normal service levels throughout the pandemic and are to be congratulated.Police confirmed that province-wide, officers issued  fines to people who did not heed the message to stay at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus over the Easter weekend.

Itrsquos a service he says he and his staff have been proud to offer.He has pupils whose parents are key NHS medics, including a couple who are both respiratory consultants, and knows the need to provide a place of shelter and safety for children of key workers is critical.ldquoEvenI had to keep the school open for one child of an NHS worker, it would be worth it, he said. ldquoMy head has said lsquoshut the schoolrsquo like the rest of them, but my heart says we are in this together and wersquove got to do our part.ldquoHowever, Irsquom not condemning any school who has closed as they have probably done so for the best of reasons.ldquoI sat in tears on Sunday evening as I didnrsquot know what I was doing was right in keeping the school open or not. We are one of the few schools offering cover for the weekends and all over Easter. Not one of my staff refused to come in to take a turn to keep the school open.ldquoIrsquove had  or more people offering to come in and help. Irsquove a great staff and they all pull together. At the end of the day, we have done our very best to safeguard the children and staff.Thankfully, Mr Moore has not received any reports of coronavirus amongst his pupils and staff, and he hopes that this status will continue.Known for not taking himself too seriously, Mr Moore has been entertaining and educating his pupils with hilarious Facebook videos of himself as educator turned entertainer. Using his considerable wit and cuddly toys as pretend schoolchildren, the principal of  years has taught mathematics, the importance of punctuation and much more over the last few weeks.He describes the incoming principal, Mr Fegan, as ldquoalmost like a son to me, and is equally proud of his other two former vice-principals, Mr Niall Stevenson and Mrs Lorna Stitt , who left the school to become principals of Downpatrick Primary School and Portavogie Primary School respectively.Mr Moore taught in primary schools in Belfast and Lisburn after he qualying in . He came to Academy as vice-principal in September  and taught a composite P-P class.He took over as principal from Mr George Smyth just five years later. The school at that time only had  children mdash it now has  children registered with double classes in all year groups and the nursery.ldquoI was appointed acting principal and Irsquove been acting principal ever since, quips Mr Moore.ldquoThe highlights for me have been many. Itrsquos been a honour not only to see children develop and flourish, but also my staff. Irsquom delighted with how my vice principals have gone on in their careers and that Mr Fegan has now been confirmed as the incoming principal after first coming here as a student teacher.ldquoIrsquove taken as much pleasure at seeing how some of my former pupils have fared in their careers and le as much as our AQE results, which are excellent. The school has also had three outstanding inspection reports in my time and apart from perhaps three rooms, the school has been completely refurbished.ldquoThe children are great ambassadors and a lot of them go on to to Down High School or Saintfield High School or Belfast grammar schools and quite often end up as head boy or head girl.His official send-off mdash a special assembly with an eveningat Temple Golf Club on June  mdash has been postponed.ldquoPersonally, itrsquos not ideal but there are people losing their lives, incomes, jobs, business are crashing, doctors and nurses putting their lives on the line, I will come back at a later stage and there will be a chance for everyone to say goodbye,said Mr Moore.ldquoTo be honest, Irsquom more upset for the Ps as most of them have been with us for eight years. Wersquove had to cancel going to Edinburgh, their leaving show which was going to be The Lion King in my honour.He said that his greatest delight at the school has been his pupils.ldquoThey are the main reason for my y tenure. It has been a joy to be their principal, he added.ldquoIt has also been an honour to have worked alongside the board of governors, both past and present, who have shared my vision for the school and supported me in its realisation.ldquoI am indebted in particular to the late Rev Alan Delamere, Mr David Donnan, Mr Geoffrey Perrin and currently Mr Peter Shaw for their leadership at the helm.ldquoThe current members of our teaching and non-teaching staff continue to reflect the professional dedication and loving care of their predecessors. I have been truly blessed to have a staff who have had a collective desire to put children first.Mr Moore also paid tribute to the parents and s for their ldquodaily partnership with the staff and your personal support to me as principal for over two decades.He and his we, Lynne, who live in Saintfield, share five children together and he says retirement will bring him a chance for them both to travel ndash when the travel ban is lted ndash and for him to devote more time to his beloved sports mdash hersquos a major football and rugby fan.He has been approached to do some educational consultancy work when he is officially retired but is happy to limit that to just several days a week.Mr Moore added: ldquoI can honestly say that during my time at Academy I have never wished that I had been a school leader anywhere  or that I was employed in an alternative profession.ldquoI will definitely shed a tear or two when I go. They will get over me, of course, as nobody is irreplaceable, but I will certainly miss the children and staff. I will not miss the responsibility of the day to day running of the place, but Irsquom a social animal and I will really miss everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Legacy.jpg","title":"The legacy of John de Courcy  ","story":"THE story starts in  when the Norman soldier-adventurer, Sir John de Courcy, went north from Dublin, the headquarters of Norman power in Ireland, and arrived at Downpatrick on February .De Courcy was a man of great physical strength and size. He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
