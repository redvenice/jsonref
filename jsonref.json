More than 10,000 minors to sign up since mandatory military service ended in 2011In 2017, 2,128 people under 18 joined the German army, up 11.4 percent from 2016 and accounting for 9 percent of new recruits, according to government data.With lively music and scenes showing the lives of young soldiers, the Bundeswehr\u0027s shows on YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet, have attracted more than 64 million views.In October, traffic at the Bundeswehr jobs website increased 60 percent during a six-week broadcast of \u0027Mali\u0027, a YouTube series centred on eight soldiers serving in the U.N.\u0027s peacekeeping mission in the West African country.The Bundeswehr Exclusive YouTube channel has over 330,000 followers and its latest production portrays the lives of a group of young paratroopers. The army is also active on other sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.According to a Trendence Institut survey of 20,000 school students across the country, the military is now considered Germany\u0027s third most attractive employer, behind sportswear maker Adidas and the police in first place.Overall, the army spent about 35 million euros ($40 million) on recruitment last year, more than double its spending in 2011, the year compulsory military service ended, annual parliament reports about the Bundeswehr showed.\u0027The Bundeswehr today is a volunteer army ...

Bank Holiday kicks off with downpours across...Share this article    Traditional recipes state pasties should be pinched on the side The pasty became synonymous with Cornwall after tin miners and others adopted it due to its unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery.In a mine, the pasty\u0027s dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.It is believed that miners may have eaten the pasty holding the thick edge of pastry, which was later thrown away, to protect the food from their dirty fingers which could have traces of arsenic on them.But many old photographs show that pasties were wrapped in bags and were eaten from end-to-end, according to the earliest Cornish recipe book, published in 1929, this is \u0027the true Cornish way\u0027 to eat a pasty.                                                    \u0027We have old postcards and photos dating back to 1901 which show miners eating pasties with the crimp on top.\u0027Crimping over the top is not unusual for many parts of Cornwall.\u0027Our grandmothers, great-grandmothers, relatives and neighbours all crimped in the same over-the-top fashion.\u0027We wanted to keep this tradition alive and fly in the face of the EU which, under guidance, stated that not only must a pasty be made in Cornwall, it must also be side crimped.\u0027Ms Parry is no stranger to battle, as she decided to follow her long-term dream of opening a pasty business after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer in 2016.She said: \u0027To say it knocked me for six and took the wind out of my sails is an understatement.\u0027Nine months of gruelling treatment followed, during which I realised I didn\u0027t like, professionally, where my life was going.\u0027Once treatment finished, I felt lost, like the best of my life had passed and I did not have any direction, until one day the subject of pasties came up.\u0027My daughter Kelly, her partner Scot and I talked and talked about it.\u0027A dream became a possibility, a possibility a plan and a plan a business.\u0027The business has rejuvenated me, I no longer worry about what may lay ahead of me. I am excited by life again and ready to fulfil my dream.\u0027She opened her bakery in October 2017 and is already hoping to expand.Her defiant stance on pasties has caused controversy on social media too.Commenting on Facebook, Steve Fitzpatrick wrote: \u0027Nothing controversial about crimping over the top..

Here’s why.Like all monkeys and apes, humans are social. We have an urgent desire to schmooze and an awareness that alcohol helps our cause.Friendships protect us against outside threats and internal stresses, and this has been key to our evolutionary success. Primate social groups, unlike most other animals, rely on bondedness to maintain social coherence.And for humans, this is where a shared bottle of red wine plays a powerful role. It isn’t just because alcohol causes us to lose our social inhibitions and become over-friendly with our drinking chums.Rather, the alcohol itself triggers the brain mechanism that is intimately involved in building and maintaining friendships in monkeys, apes and humans. This mechanism is the endorphin system. Popular Instagram fitness model is arrested for mowing down...Two passed out toddlers are rescued from the back of a hot...Share this articleEndorphins (the word is a contraction of ‘endogenous morphine) are neurotransmitters that are intimately involved, through their opiate-like effects, in the management of pain.That opiate-like all’s-well-with-the-world effect seems to be crucial for establishing bonded relationships that allow iniduals to trust each other.Drinking, seen in this light, is a profound activity. It enables humans to open up their deepest selves, giving another twist to the ancient saying ‘in vino veritas’ (in wine, truth).Of the many social activities that trigger the endorphin system in humans (they range from laughter to singing and dancing), the consumption of alcohol seems to be one of the most effective.At detox clinics, one increasingly common form of treatment is to dose an addict with an endorphin blocker that locks onto the brain’s endorphin receptors but is pharmacologically neutral, so you don’t get the hit when you drink. Instead, you get a mild form of cold turkey.          Alcohol triggers the brain mechanism that is intimately involved in building and maintaining friendshipsHumans have a long association with alcohol that reaches back into the mists of prehistory. Archaeologists such as Patrick McGovern from the University of Pennsylvania Museum have found residues of fermentation in clay vessels in China dating back more than 8,000 years.There is an emerging view among some archaeologists that the reason humans started cultivating grains such as wheat and barley was not to make bread (as everyone had previously assumed) but to make a gruel that could be fermented. One reason for this thinking is that primitive cereals cultivated in the Middle East during the Neolithic period, have a different gluten structure, making it more difficult to make good bread.They do, however, make a very good gruel that ferments well. If you had to choose between a tasteless, soggy flatbread and a glass of beer, well it’s a no-brainer, isn’t it?While the big innovation of the Neolithic may have been brewing rather than agriculture, the exploitation of naturally fermenting fruits may have a much longer history.Elephants in southern Africa and India have a penchant for eating fermented fruits and can become quite woozy on it.Primatologist Kim Hockings, of Exeter University, has studied west African chimpanzees that habitually steal the palm wine left fermenting in trees by local farmers. And Robert Dudley, from the University of California Berkeley, claims that we share with the apes a unique genetic mutation dating back 12 million years that allows us to break down the alcohols in over-ripe fruits.For humans, if not for elephants, fermented drinks play a central role in feasts the world over — and feasts are all about friendships. And it is probably in this respect that alcohol plays a seminal role.We need friends because they provide help when we need an extra hand, or someone to listen with a modicum of empathy to a tale of woe.          Boris Johnson shares a pint with Zac Goldsmith at Leadenhall Market in London But friendship, it turns out, has other hidden benefits.One of the biggest surprises of the last decade or so has been the torrent of publications showing that our happiness, health and susceptibility to disease — even our speed of recovery from surgery and how long we live — are all influenced by the number of friends we have.One study by Julianne Holt-Lunstad collated the results of 148 studies of heart attack patients. The aim was to determine what it was that best predicted the probability of surviving for 12 months after a first heart attack.Aside from sampling a large number of people, it was based on a hard-nosed outcome: survival or death. And the best predictor? The number and quality of friendships you had.A short way behind that was giving up smoking (no surprises there). Then, way further down in terms of impact came exercise, obesity, alcohol consumption, quality of diet and even air quality.It seems you can eat, drink and slob about as much as you want and it won’t affect your chances anything like as much as having a few good friends.Loneliness is a health threat in the western world, and the UK even has a dedicated minister to address the problem.How to solve it is a huge challenge, but encouraging people to socialise over a few beers or some wine at the village pub may be a good place to start.While the role of alcohol in sustaining the friendship networks that provide us with psychological and emotional support is crucial, the endorphins triggered by what we do with friends may have hidden benefits. They appear to tune the immune system by activating the body’s T-cells — part of the defence mechanism that gives us resistance to many common ailments.I’ve lost track of how many times I have been told by ex-military folk that they were never so ill as when they returned to civvy street. It wasn’t that they weren’t as fit as they had been in the forces it was that they kept falling ill with coughs and colds and the detritus of everyday life.When I mentioned the camaraderie of Army life, the odd pint and all that exercise on the drill square, they immediately got the point.Exercise, alcohol and friends — three great ways to trigger endorphins. Of course, like anything biological, overdo the alcohol and you’re on the downward curve before you know it. But then that’s true of everything we eat.           For humans,  a shared bottle of red wine plays a powerful roleProteins, salt, fats and sugars are all good for you, but have too much and you’ll be pitched into the diseases of civilisation — diabetes, obesity, cancers, hypertension, you name it.The same is true of alcohol. A few drinks will relax you and make you more sociable: they even seem to do you some good. But have the proverbial one too many, and you end up paying a price.This was borne out by a recent article in the British Medical Journal reporting on a study of 9,000 Whitehall civil servants whose drinking habits and health had been studied over several decades.Those who had consumed no alcohol in their 40s and 50s, along with those who had typically consumed more than the official government guideline of 14 units a week, had a significantly increased risk of dementia later in life.Those who did not drink at all had a 50 per cent greater risk of developing dementia than those who drank moderately, and the same risk applied to those who drank heavily (more than about 40 units a week).Drinking more than 60 units a week (roughly equivalent to a bottle of wine a day) doubled their risk.These results may be even more interesting than at first seems to be the case. The study didn’t look at friendship as a factor, but I am struck by the pattern.People who drink moderately tend to be social drinkers, whereas heavy drinkers ramp up their consumption because they often drink alone at home — or drink past the point of being able to engage in the kinds of conversations on which friendships are built.It may be these results actually reflect the fact that social drinking creates networks of friendships, and it is being embedded in a supportive network that protects against dementia as much as anything else.Friends engage us in conversation in ways that keep the brain ticking over, as well as providing us with endorphin-related health benefits. When we meet over a beer, we talk, laugh, tell stories, occasionally even sing and dance.All of these have been shown to trigger the endorphin system, and so help the process of social bonding as well as the processes of healing. At the University of Oxford, we recently undertook a set of studies in collaboration with the Campaign for Real Ale to look at the benefits of old-style community pubs relative to the high street bars that have come to dominate our social horizons in recent years. One component of this was a national survey of pub use.          People who drink moderately tend to be social drinkers, whereas heavy drinkers ramp up their consumption because they often drink alone at homeRather strikingly, this showed that people who had a ‘local’ that they patronised regularly had more close friends, felt happier, were more satisfied with their lives, more embedded into their local communities, and more trusting of those around them.Those who never drank did consistently worse on all these criteria, while those who frequented a local did better than regular drinkers who had no local that they visited regularly.A more detailed analysis suggested that it was the frequency of pub visits that lay at the heart of this: it seemed that those who visited the same pub more often were more engaged with, and trusting of, their local community, and as a result had more friends.In a separate study of social eating, we found that eating with others also positively affected these same outcomes, especially if this was done in the evening.When we asked what other things happened during the meal that might have produced these effects, the three things most frequently listed were laughter, reminiscences and — yes, you’ve guessed it — the consumption of alcohol, all three of which are good at triggering the endorphin system.The fact that evening meals, in this study, seemed to be more important than lunchtime meals is interesting, because there seems to be something especially magical about doing social things in the evening that enhances all these effects. Think of the very different buzz you get from going to an evening performance at the theatre compared to the matinee.This may well be a hangover that dates back 400,000 years to the time we mastered fire. Doing so allowed our early ancestors to shift all their social bonding activities to the evening, so freeing off a lot of extra time during daylight for foraging and other economically essential activities. Add a few fermenting fruits to the mix and...In the flickering light of the campfire, you can’t do much that requires keen eyesight such as sewing or making tools, but you can chat away across the flames.This is nicely illustrated by what South African San Bushmen talk about around their campfires.When anthropologist Polly Wiesner listened in on their conversations, she found daytime conversations typically consisted of boring factual topics and discussions of trading agreements with neighbours, but evening conversations were invariably about social topics or involved stories and jokes.Friendships work because they provide us with ‘a shoulder to cry on’ on that handful of occasions when our world falls apart.But friendships have to be set up ahead of need if they are to work for us, and that means investing a lot of time in them.Our studies suggest we devote 40 per cent of our available social time (and the same proportion of our emotional capital) to an inner core of about five shoulders-to-cry-on. And we devote another 20 per cent to the next ten people who are socially most important to us. In other words, about two-thirds of our total social effort is devoted to just 15 people.That is a very substantial commitment, and amounts to an average of about two hours a day. It makes it all the more necessary that what we do with them is fun, otherwise they won’t keep coming back for more.So, if you want to know the secret of a long and happy life, money is not the answer.Get rid of the takeaway in front of the telly and bin the hasty sandwich at your desk: the important thing is to take time out with people you know and talk to them over a beer or two, even a bottle of Prosecco if you really must.There’s nothing quite like a convivial evening wrapped around a pint to give you health, happiness and a sense of well-being.Robin Dunbar is Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of the British Academy.

Tube of eggs in cryogenic (frozen) storage, aboveWomen undergoing IVF usually have a fresh embryo transferred into the uterus within a week of the eggs being retrieved.But the IVF clinic, which is part of Cambridge University Hospitals Trust, found that waiting for the body to recover improved a woman’s chances of conceiving.Doctors say the high success rates mean that for the first time, couples can start fertility treatment knowing that it is more likely to succeed than fail.The technique – which involves implanting the first embryo at least a month after undergoing the fertility treatment – resulted in pregnancy 62 per cent of the time, compared with 41 per cent using fresh ones straight away.This is nearly double the national average rate of 36 per cent for using fresh embryos, according to figures from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.Consultant embryologist Stephen Harbottle of Cambridge IVF, who led the research, said it is the most ‘exciting’ development he has witnessed in 25 years.          Women undergoing IVF usually have a fresh embryo transferred into the uterus within a week of the eggs being retrieved‘The biggest angst with fertility treatment is that it’s always been that the treatment is more likely to fail than be successful,’ he said. ‘What we’ve been doing for years is put the best embryo into the worst environment so by being very well-meaning, we might actually have been holding back success rates for years. \u0027We can start saying to people you’ve got a better than 50 per cent chance of success in most of the age groups. Across the board, data is showing a huge increase in success rates. It’s really exciting.’Typically, a woman undergoing IVF is given follicle-stimulating hormones to encourage the production of around ten eggs in one go. These are then harvested, fertilised with sperm and left to develop as embryos before one is transferred into the uterus. Any remaining successful embryos can then be frozen for use at a later date.Doctors at the clinic noticed success rates were higher when using these frozen embryos rather than fresh ones immediately implanted.They decided to explore further the process, known as frozen embryo transfer (FET), which was already being used in America and Scandinavia.Pregnant Venezuelan women are fleeing their country to give...Hero mom of triplets who gave CPR to her first newborn while...Share this articleLast year they enrolled 147 women, aged between 24 and 45, to take part in an 18-month pilot of the ‘freeze-all’ process to see how it affected their fertility chances. As a result, 62 per cent of women became pregnant, with improved success rates for women of all ages, the researchers say.They believe the success is largely because the body is allowed to return to normal after the disruptive hormonal treatment, which could create a hostile environment for the embryo. The clinic has now received NHS approval to start offering the ‘freeze-all’ service to patients. It means patients from anywhere in the UK will be able to sign up for the treatment, which costs an additional £245 on top of the initial £2,500 for a round of IVF.          While there have been some live births, the trial is continuing, with many of the participants currently pregnantLike many other clinical commissioning groups, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough health trust stopped free IVF in its region last September.While there have been some live births, the trial is continuing, with many of the participants currently pregnant.Commenting on the Cambridge technique, Stuart Lavery, a fertility expert at Imperial College London, said: ‘I think it’s an exciting area but I want to see much more evidence before I see a change in practice.’  How it helped me become a mother           Delighted: Kerrie Suarez with EmilioKerrie Suarez’s job as a nursery nurse served as a constant reminder of what she so dearly wanted.But she was unable to have a baby because she suffered from endometriosis, which saw scar tissue build up in her fallopian tubes and stopped her eggs from being released.Mrs Suarez, 34, who lives in Cheadle, Manchester, with her husband, Francisco, also 34, tried fertility treatment. But after three IVF rounds on the NHS with fresh embryos, she still was not pregnant.For their fourth attempt the couple decided to go private. They opted for a ‘frozen cycle’ after doctors suggested the womb lining was more receptive to frozen embryos.Mrs Suarez waited for two months before an embryo was implanted and then finally found she was pregnant. She had a 6lb 12oz boy Emilio, who is now ten months. ‘I still find myself staring at him in wonder,’ she said. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/24/21/4F5E2E6A00000578-0-image-m-58_1535143564933.jpg","title":"Drivers paying 7 cars 12 months ago","story":"    Millions of drivers hitting the roads this bank holiday will have to pay £7 more to fill up their cars than they did a year agoThis equates to around £7.17 when filling up a 55-litre tank on a typical family car.Drivers of diesel cars have been hit even harder with the average price rising by just under 15p a litre – or £8.15 a tank – in the past year. S\u0026P 500 and Nasdaq close at record highs, two days after US...Taxman is now taking FIVE MINUTES to answer phones after...Share this articleThe average price is now 132.72p a litre, which is the highest level since September 2014, and up from 117.91p since the August bank holiday last year.

Mr Millett was the only blogger covering the event. In a statement released on Friday evening Mr Corbyn said he had been defending the ambassador from \u0027what I thought were deliberate misrepresentations\u0027 by people \u0027for whom English was a first language, when it isn\u0027t for the ambassador\u0027.Mr Corbyn said: \u0027I described those pro-Israel activists as Zionists, in the accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people - and that is made clear in the rest of my speech that day.\u0027I am now more careful with how I might use the term \u0027Zionist\u0027 because a once self-identifying political term has been increasingly hijacked by anti-Semites as code for Jews.\u0027Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger had earlier said that the video contained \u0027inexcusable comments\u0027 which made her feel \u0027unwelcome in my own party\u0027.          Speaking in 2013 at a London conference promoted by the Hamas\u0027s propaganda website, Mr Corbyn said British \u0027Zionists\u0027 did not want to study history or understand irony \u0027despite having lived in this country all their lives\u0027She wrote on Twitter: \u0027The video released today of the leader of @UKLabour making inexcusable comments - defended by a party spokesman - makes me as a proud British Jew feel unwelcome in my own party.\u0027I\u0027ve lived in Britain all my life and I don\u0027t need any lessons in historyirony.\u0027    The Labour leader made the comments at a conference at Friends House in Euston. The event was advertised online by Hamas\u0027 Al-Qassam Brigades, which is designated a terrorist group by Britain, the EU, the United States and other countries.In one of the speeches, made by 911 conspiracy theorist Alan Hart, \u0027Zionism\u0027 was described as a \u0027cancer at the heart of international affairs\u0027.

More than 10,000 minors to sign up since mandatory military service ended in 2011In 2017, 2,128 people under 18 joined the German army, up 11.4 percent from 2016 and accounting for 9 percent of new recruits, according to government data.With lively music and scenes showing the lives of young soldiers, the Bundeswehr\u0027s shows on YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet, have attracted more than 64 million views.In October, traffic at the Bundeswehr jobs website increased 60 percent during a six-week broadcast of \u0027Mali\u0027, a YouTube series centred on eight soldiers serving in the U.N.\u0027s peacekeeping mission in the West African country.The Bundeswehr Exclusive YouTube channel has over 330,000 followers and its latest production portrays the lives of a group of young paratroopers. The army is also active on other sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.According to a Trendence Institut survey of 20,000 school students across the country, the military is now considered Germany\u0027s third most attractive employer, behind sportswear maker Adidas and the police in first place.Overall, the army spent about 35 million euros ($40 million) on recruitment last year, more than double its spending in 2011, the year compulsory military service ended, annual parliament reports about the Bundeswehr showed.\u0027The Bundeswehr today is a volunteer army ...

The number of private schools offering the vocational qualifications has almost doubled in three years – from 53 in 2015 to 93.BTECs were once looked down upon in some elite circles because they are more job-focused. However, a spokesman for the ISC said private schools were becoming ‘less snobbish’ and understood that BTECs were more appropriate for some career paths. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/15/22/2F77351400000578-0-image-a-9_1531691969561.jpg","title":"HMRC taking FIVE MINUTES answer phones overestimating numbers online","story":"    Headquarters of Her Majesty\u0027s Revenue and Customs. 100 Parliament Street, LondonTaxman will now have \u0027shocking\u0027 new powers to raid bank...Tens of thousands of pensioners face income CUTS while...Share this articleHMRC\u0027s annual report admits the failings are down to the fact that it expected more people to be using their digital services.This meant they had not employed enough staff to answer the phone.

Tube of eggs in cryogenic (frozen) storage, aboveWomen undergoing IVF usually have a fresh embryo transferred into the uterus within a week of the eggs being retrieved.But the IVF clinic, which is part of Cambridge University Hospitals Trust, found that waiting for the body to recover improved a woman’s chances of conceiving.Doctors say the high success rates mean that for the first time, couples can start fertility treatment knowing that it is more likely to succeed than fail.The technique – which involves implanting the first embryo at least a month after undergoing the fertility treatment – resulted in pregnancy 62 per cent of the time, compared with 41 per cent using fresh ones straight away.This is nearly double the national average rate of 36 per cent for using fresh embryos, according to figures from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.Consultant embryologist Stephen Harbottle of Cambridge IVF, who led the research, said it is the most ‘exciting’ development he has witnessed in 25 years.          Women undergoing IVF usually have a fresh embryo transferred into the uterus within a week of the eggs being retrieved‘The biggest angst with fertility treatment is that it’s always been that the treatment is more likely to fail than be successful,’ he said. ‘What we’ve been doing for years is put the best embryo into the worst environment so by being very well-meaning, we might actually have been holding back success rates for years. \u0027We can start saying to people you’ve got a better than 50 per cent chance of success in most of the age groups. Across the board, data is showing a huge increase in success rates. It’s really exciting.’Typically, a woman undergoing IVF is given follicle-stimulating hormones to encourage the production of around ten eggs in one go. These are then harvested, fertilised with sperm and left to develop as embryos before one is transferred into the uterus. Any remaining successful embryos can then be frozen for use at a later date.Doctors at the clinic noticed success rates were higher when using these frozen embryos rather than fresh ones immediately implanted.They decided to explore further the process, known as frozen embryo transfer (FET), which was already being used in America and Scandinavia.Pregnant Venezuelan women are fleeing their country to give...Hero mom of triplets who gave CPR to her first newborn while...Share this articleLast year they enrolled 147 women, aged between 24 and 45, to take part in an 18-month pilot of the ‘freeze-all’ process to see how it affected their fertility chances. As a result, 62 per cent of women became pregnant, with improved success rates for women of all ages, the researchers say.They believe the success is largely because the body is allowed to return to normal after the disruptive hormonal treatment, which could create a hostile environment for the embryo. The clinic has now received NHS approval to start offering the ‘freeze-all’ service to patients. It means patients from anywhere in the UK will be able to sign up for the treatment, which costs an additional £245 on top of the initial £2,500 for a round of IVF.

She had a 6lb 12oz boy Emilio, who is now ten months. ‘I still find myself staring at him in wonder,’ she said. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/25/12/4F60DE5100000578-6097159-The_81_year_old_Pope_Francis_waves_from_his_car_at_Dublin_Intern-a-72_1535195514361.jpg","title":"Smiling Pope Francis steps plane Dublin papal visit Ireland","story":"    Pope Francis delivers a speech in St Patrick\u0027s Hall at Dublin Castle where he spoke about sex abuse in the Catholic Church, saying he felt \u0027pain and shame\u0027 at the failure of church authorities to tackle the \u0027grave scandal\u0027 of clerical abuse in Ireland            The 81-year-old Pope Francis waves from his car at Dublin International Airport as he begins the first papal visit to Ireland since John Paul II went to the country in 1979          The pope\u0027s cape blows in the wind as he walks down the steps of his plane in Dublin today Speaking at St Patrick\u0027s Hall in Dublin Castle, the Pope said: \u0027With regard to the most vulnerable, I cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal caused in Ireland by the abuse of young people by members of the church charged with responsibility for their protection and education,\u0027 he said.\u0027The failure of ecclesiastical authorities - bishops, religious superiors, priests and others - adequately to address these repellent crimes has rightly given rise to outrage and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community.

Through the register, Bailey traced the 18 male patients including an elderly priest, Jean Revello, and Henri Enrico, who was described as constantly smashing up furniture and crockery. Bailey was able to match many of the names with death certificates and other evidence, and details of medical conditions and minimal treatment in a later book by the asylum director.Revello, admitted two years before Van Gogh, aged 20, would spend the next half century in the asylum and die there in 1932. Van Gogh described fellow patients, whom he called “my companions in misfortune”, slumped into silent resignation, with no treatment and nothing to fill their days except the next stodgy meal, eaten with a spoon because of the risk from knives and forks. Some, however, were very troubled. In one letter, he described the long nights: “One continually hears shouts and terrible howls as of animals in a menagerie.”The artist was judged by his brother and friends to be unfit to live alone after he mutilated himself, cutting off his ear and presenting it, wrapped in paper, to a young woman in a local brothel, following the collapse of a proposed artistic partnership with Paul Gauguin.Bailey, whose book Starry Night, Van Gogh at the Asylum, is published on Monday, said the register was key to discovering previously unknown details of the artist’s time there, including the fact that neither his friends from Arles, 16 miles (25km) away, nor Theo ever visited.Theo Van Gogh was kept informed by the stream of illustrated letters from his brother, but also news from the asylum director of Van Gogh’s three serious collapses over the year, when the paints he tried to swallow had to be taken from him, and he was confined to a small, bare, locked room instead of his usual bright bedroom and separate studio on an upper floor.The director, Théophile Peyron, wrote: “On several occasions he has attempted to poison himself, either by swallowing colours that he used for painting, or by ingesting paraffin, which he had taken from the boy while he was filling his lamps.” His brother, recently married and expecting his first child in Paris, stayed away.Bailey said: “I now appreciate quite what a terrifying environment it must have been for Van Gogh.It had been suggested that Van Gogh might have been sent to an asylum in Marseille that had more than 1,000 patients, which Bailey believes would have destroyed the artist.The Saint-Paul asylum, which remains part of a psychiatric hospital, was once a monastery. As an asylum, it originally held more patients, initially offered first, second and third-class accommodation at different prices. By Van Gogh’s arrival, the male wing was almost empty, so each man had plenty of space.Conditions were improving under a new director from an earlier stage, when an unpublished official report condemned neglect, terrible food, and elderly, incontinent patients lying on straw mattresses described as reduced to manure. Life there by Van Gogh’s time was boring, but not brutal.Van Gogh was released on 16 May 1890, at his own request, despite evidence of mental collapse following his previous brief breaks from the asylum. He yearned for new spring landscapes to paint, blamed the company of his fellow patients for his previous and longest collapse, and wrote “the prison was crushing me”.The final medical note described Van Gogh as “cured”. He travelled to northern France to begin again, but after a final burst of creativity, he died within two months – 36 hours after shooting himself in the stomach while out painting in the midsummer fields.“There have been suggestions that his death was an accident or even manslaughter, but that’s nonsense,” Bailey said.“The evidence of his mental state in the previous year makes it incontrovertible that he took his own life, but it was thanks to the asylum, his strength of will and his art that he survived that year in which he was able to create so much.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b221aa0b311b05783d2353d79004c0e4bc2cd012/0_192_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fa2ea8a0f405f634dedb8779e48cb84","title":"no ones home europes abandoned houses","story":"Urban photographer Roman Robroek spent five years scouring the continent for the grandest examples of forgotten architectural beauty"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2de41afc7fc86f6df74f805d52b7157375634cf/6_465_3569_2141/master/3569.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41b1e6bb6d1ffde42679ed0407f47e8f","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s reunion with her daughter, Eid-al-Adha celebrations and the Pope’s visit to Ireland – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d55dc6d5ac3448d7ad47fcfb3ebe0feb00bb62be/0_414_2503_1501/master/2503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16031f686d374ea798cf73b7db773178","title":"great comic subjects in the right hands the genius of french author violette leduc","story":"The French author makes hunger and humiliation wildly funny, and portrays sex and society in completely new ways – and remains a literary outsiderViolette Leduc’s novels are works of genius and also a bit peculiar. It is not surprising that Jean Genet was one of Leduc’s early admirers, as were Simone de Beauvoir and Albert Camus. According to Edmund White’s autobiography My Lives, Genet and Leduc even made an amateur film together, a re‑enactment of a baptism in which Genet, who was an orphan, played the child and Leduc the mother. Both writers were illegitimate, born at a time – Leduc in 1907 – when such things mattered. The theatre of baptism with its narratives of belonging, of being ordained and claimed, must have been very potent to stage. The mind whirls at the thought of what they might have got up to. What a shame the film has been lost.If, as White points out, both Proust and Genet “were dismantling all received ideas about the couple, manhood, love and sexual roles”, I would include Leduc in the rearranging of the social and sexual scaffolding of her time. I don’t think she set out to do this. It was just that her life wasn’t quite bourgeois or stable enough to do anything else. Leduc can make this reader laugh out loud at her grand themes: loneliness, humiliation, hunger, defeat, disappointment – all of which are great comic subjects in the right hands. Samuel Beckett could do this, too. It requires a sensibility that is totally unsentimental, a way of staring at life and making from it a kind of tough poetry created in part by not having led an existence that makes one believe that the so-called compassionate and tender have any pity.However, it is female love and desire that are Leduc’s main subjects. She herself stated that she wanted to express “as exactly as possible, as minutely as possible, the sensations of physical love”.In The Lady and the Little Fox Fur it is the sensation of hunger, of loss of a future, of everyday connection to the rhythms of busy Parisian life that concerns the old lady of the title. “She was breathing the oxygen meant for people who had spent their day working. To cry out that it was impossible to begin her life all over again would be useless.”Leduc’s starving old woman isn’t really old by today’s standards. Nevertheless we are told she “was handling her sixtieth year as lightly as we touch the lint when dressing a wound”. It is because Leduc profoundly understands how mysterious human beings are that her attention as a writer is always in an interesting place. Her old lady gazes at a calf’s tongue in a butcher’s shop window and asks herself: “What was there on a calf’s tongue?”It reminds her of fine sand on the petals of a yellow rose, which makes her think of painting sunsets in her younger days. Her paintings were her equivalent of “altars and sacred wafers”. Leduc does not sanitise and flatten a perception and make it more literal than it is she accepts its own language. Life, like language, is coherent and incoherent, and Leduc knows the only way to do justice to this dynamic is to fold into the texture of her narrative the strange in-between bits of experience.She is incapable of coming up with a boring sentence. There may be a gushing sentence now and again, perhaps, when she forgets to take a breath and hyperventilates on the page. But even that’s quite exciting. Evelyn Waugh’s definition of fiction as “experience totally transformed” or Hanif Kureishi’s astute observation in My Ear at His Heart that writing is often a substitute for experience, a kind of day dreaming, are fair enough but not completely true for her. Writing for Leduc is a concentrated form of experiencing. She is a present-tense sort of writer, and like Virginia Woolf she seeks to record “the atoms as they fall upon the mind”. When her old lady wakes up thirsty one summer morning in Paris she wants to find an orange to suck. So she rummages in the bins and discovers a reeking fox fur in a box labelled tripe. Instead of an orange she had found “a winter fur in summer”.She picks it up and takes it home. What does she do with it?“She kissed him, and then went on kissing him, from the tip of his muzzle to the tip of his brush. But her lips were cold as marble: in her mind these kisses were also an act of religious meditation.”I laughed at these lines. You are really crazy, Violette, I thought to myself. And then I read the next few lines, where I learn the writer laughs, too. “She looked him up and down, then burst into her first fit of uncontrollable laughter: the amusement he filled her with was no less sincere than the love she felt for him.”Precisely. The amusement Leduc fills this reader with is no less sincere than the admiration she feels for her. Literary provocateurs have always written rather peculiar books, and great publishers have always published them. Much to the delight of readers across a number of generations, Leduc wrote her way out of isolation and invisibility and into the canon of 20th‑century literature. As the old lady remarks at the end of this gentle, bittersweet novel, her “world consisted of nothing but what she had invented” •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a54407cdc0f522d98365649dcfd3b4f7534e50c/1138_532_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4578133a2797dd148fa45f6f0480666e","title":"sally rooney interview normal people conversations with friends","story":"Her debut Conversations With Friends saw her hailed as ‘Salinger for the Snapchat generation’. As her second book Normal People hits shelves, Rooney discusses post-crash Ireland, the eighth amendment, and being up for the Man Booker prizeSally Rooney is one of the most exciting voices to emerge in an already crackerjack new generation of Irish writers. Her debut novel, Conversations with Friends, was written in three months – although she says the first draft was in “a terrible state” – and published in the spring of last year, to great acclaim. And here comes her second, Normal People, already being spoken of as even more accomplished.The judges of this year’s Man Booker prize seem to think so they have included the novel on their longlist (how does she feel about making the cut? “All the total cliches,” she says. “It’s amazing.”). Last year, she was named the PFDSunday Times young writer of the year, and she has been shortlisted for its EFG short story award as well. And she has just become the editor of the Irish literary magazine Stinging Fly, and published her first issue. She is 27.We meet in a buzzy, coffee-in-a-specimen-jar type of cafe in Dublin’s Merchant’s Quay area, just south of the Liffey. Over the course of our conversation she is open without being expansive, relaxed yet precise in her responses. As we part, I check on a couple of basic facts – the name of her school, siblings, et cetera. She laughs at the lack of incident she has to relate and tells me: “Just say she was quite boring and normal!”Spoiler: though I’d refer you to Rooney’s new novel to ponder the complicated concept of “normal”, she certainly isn’t boring.What is it that Rooney does that has struck such a resonant chord? Why has she so swiftly been dubbed a “Salinger for the Snapchat generation”, a novelist of the Instagram age? According to her, “it’s just stories about fake people”. Additionally, they’re the kind of people you could easily find quite annoying: usually attractive, often quite wealthy, clever, urban and urbane, prone to self-reflection and keen on verbal sparring.Conversations with Friends, is the tale of young Dubliners Frances and Bobbi and their friendship (and more) with an older couple. In conversations with other readers, I have discovered the novel provokes a huge debate, much of it concerned with whether it has a happy or disastrous ending concerning Frances’s romantic life and her affair with the older married actor Nick. Rooney and I talk for some time about the attention that particular plot point has garnered, and I am delighted to report that she endorses my interpretation, also known as the fence-sitting position: “I don’t think I was strongly in either camp,” she says. Despite the bracing directness of her work, she seems drawn to equivocation, to teasing out the paradoxes that rigid views and actions can create.That tightrope act has been picked up by critics. Reviewing the first novel in the New Yorker, Alexandra Schwartz admitted to “the curious feeling that Rooney wasn’t always sure where she was going but that she trusted herself to find out”. And for Schwartz, it paid off: “She writes with a rare, thrilling confidence, in a lucid and exacting style uncluttered with the sort of steroidal imagery and strobe flashes of figurative language that so many dutifully literary novelists employ.” In Normal People, we see Marianne and Connell from school in a small town in Sligo to Trinity College Dublin and through an on-off relationship, encountering them in a series of discrete scenes that take place between 2011 and 2015.The narrative is shadowed by all manner of what Rooney calls “externalities” – the extreme dysfunction and violence in Marianne’s family, her wealth and Connell’s lack of it, and the wider backdrop of post-crash Ireland and the way its class structure impacts on the social and educational lives of the young – but she was clear that its major focus had to be the protagonists’ relationship. As with Conversations with Friends, the project started life as short stories, and with Rooney following her characters down the rabbit hole, dropping in at different moments in their lives, recording how each scene, “whether it be momentous or something small, has in some way altered the dynamic between these two people so that from this time forward it will be slightly – or a lot – different”.I tell Rooney that I was struck by how great the gulf was between my experience of reading Normal People – its sheer immediacy and rawness gripped me, to the point that I read it in 24 hours, finishing at 3am – and my subsequent attempts to dissect how it worked, what level of artifice it employed and why (I add that this is intended as a compliment). What particularly compels are the baton switches of power, and the ways in which they often send the participants into bewildered disarray, as here:She comes to sit down with him and he touches her cheek. He has a terrible sense all of a sudden that he could hit her face, very hard even, and she would just sit there and let him. The idea frightens him so badly that he pulls his chair back and stands up. His hands are shaking. He doesn’t know why he thought about it. Maybe he wants to do it. But it makes him feel sick. What’s wrong? she says.But if Rooney’s talent is for interiority, for the precise, perceptive portrayal of mental and emotional landscapes, the power of her writing also relies on setting and social context, and on her presenting unglamorous, real-world problems – in Conversations with Friends, the central character had endometriosis – alongside less tangible challenges. Normal People is set during the years of austerity and, she says: “It would have been really difficult for me to write about young people leaving home in the west of Ireland, moving to college, and not confront the economic disparities that were emerging at that time, like the stripping back of protections for people from working-class backgrounds who were going to college. I don’t think I would have been able to really explore what was going on in those characters’ interior lives without being sensitive to the changes that were happening outside.”Rooney was one of those mobile young people not so long ago. She was born and grew up in Castlebar, a town of around 10,000 inhabitants which is transfigured in Normal People as Carricklea, a place from which Marianne can’t wait to escape (“She’s never been inside the sports centre. She’s never gone drinking in the abandoned hat factory, though she has been driven past it in the car”). Although Rooney, too, yearned for “the biggest possible urban space” that Dublin offered, her upbringing appears to have been far more rewarding and generative than that of her creation. Her mother, for example, has only recently retired from running the local arts centre both her parents are keen readers, although Rooney describes herself as reading in “a very flimsy way” in her adolescence, picking up anything that came to hand.She joined a writing group when she was 15. “I would come in every week and get really excited about bringing in my little rubbish story!” she recalls . “It definitely wasn’t like I moved to Dublin and met other writers and then realised I wanted to be a writer I was lucky that in Castlebar there’s a writing community, there were a lot of people around who were working seriously on really interesting stuff. So in that sense I was blessed, and I had people who were willing to encourage me when I was 15.” She has an older brother and younger sister, both of whom now live in Dublin.The world she describes in Normal People is very much the rarefied realm of Trinity College, where she studied English literature as an undergraduate before completing a master’s in American literature. In her first week there, she met Thomas Morris, who became a close friend and published ahead of her, with his short story collection We Don’t Know What We’re Doing. “My only experience of Dublin at the time was Trinity,” Rooney says, “which is such a tiny section of Dublin society, and very insular. When I was in Trinity, at least for the first couple of years, I didn’t really interact with anyone who wasn’t in Trinity. A lot of the years I lived on campus. And these are very much the people I write about in the book but that’s not me making a commentary on Dublin.”Towards the end of Normal People, Connell goes to see a visiting writer read from his work, and finds it lacking: “It was culture as class performance, literature fetishised for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they might afterwards feel superior to the uneducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about.”Both Frances, from Conversations, and Connell have stories accepted by literary magazines during the course of the books, as did Rooney herself. But, like them, she didn’t embrace the prospect of the publishing world: “I wasn’t really interested in it. I wasn’t really interested in sending manuscripts out to agents. I just wanted to sit in my room and write.”Rooney’s characters are politically literate and opinionated to different degrees, drawn to and sometimes upended by drink, drugs and sex. Frances and Bobbi wrangle endlessly about political and economic theory Marianne hopes for a swift and brutal revolution. Like many young adults, the casts of both novels flirt with what they perceive as a “grown-up” world – in Normal People, there’s a dinner party in Italy, during which they squabble over the correct glasses for champagne, like middle-aged arrivistes – while also being semi-repulsed and frightened by it.I ask Rooney about the large and loose group of writers with whom she’s now becoming associated, a group characterised by the range and innovation of their work, including Colin Barrett, Lisa McInerney and Eimear McBride. What does she think has caused such a flourishing of new talent? “I think first of all it definitely has to do with the financial crisis,” she replies. All the writers we’ve been talking about are post-crash, and “that’s when that stuff starts getting published. So there has to be something in the cultural conditions generated by the financial crisis that’s connected to the way people are writing now, or the way they’re thinking about fiction.”She ponders whether the end of the Celtic Tiger years brought with it not only disillusion but “also a freedom to speak more critically about Irish society, in the way that maybe there was a bit too much cultural cheerleading going on during the Celtic Tiger years. Obviously the economy in particular, but also if you look at the social change that has emerged in those years since the crash in Ireland, I think it speaks to a deep cultural shift that has taken place in part maybe because of the recession.”On this matter and others, Rooney is eager to qualify her arguments: she was, she points out, only a teenager during the years of boom and bust, and she is also wary of sounding as though “it was all worth it because we got some good books out of it”. But, she maintains: “I do think that it inaugurated a period of serious social critique, and from that we’ve seen a change – referendums and so on.”The referendum that Rooney is talking about is the repeal of the Irish constitution’s eighth amendment at the end of May, in which the country voted overwhelmingly to allow women the right to terminate pregnancy. (We went on to talk about the other referendum, of which more in due course.) I knew that Rooney, along with many Irish writers, had been vocal in her support for the Yes campaign, and I ask her what the experience felt like.“It’s hard to talk about it,” she says. “It’s something that I cared about a lot for a long time.” At school, she recalls anti-abortion groups visiting and showing the pupils videos of foetuses beyond basic sex education, there was no counter-view outlining the argument that women should have control over their reproductive rights. She was, she says, “very oppositional” and “quite belligerent” and this, she thought, was an issue worth feeling rage over, even though the prospect of repeal wasn’t even under discussion then. By the time the referendum came around, “it felt like I’d just been nursing that anger for a really long time”.The day itself, she recalls, was a heady mixture of celebration, exhaustion, disbelief and relief, but it quickly yielded to a different perspective. “All that suffering was so pointless,” she says. “Why did we do that? Why did we do any of that? Thirty years. All this anger and sadness, and all the horrible things that have happened to people. People have actually suffered for this law, and people died ... It was hard to sustain that feeling of jubilation because none of this should ever have happened.”It’s striking that Rooney speaks in very calm and measured tones, frequently circling back to make sure she’s expressed herself clearly but she also uses noticeably direct emotional language to describe aspects of her experience. It’s weird, she says, to let go of the “wound” that she felt over abortion law, pre repeal and when we move on to talk about Brexit, she refers to the dismissive way that Irish concerns about the impact on the border and on the Good Friday agreement have been treated as “hurtful”.Well in advance of the UK referendum, she argues, “everyone on this island was saying Northern Ireland is the big issue, and none of you are talking about it. It’s like the British media just didn’t care. All you kept talking about was whether Jeremy Corbyn’s a good Labour leader and if he cares about remain enough, and tariffs and rates. Is anyone in the UK listening?”The stakes, as she points out, are high: “A civil conflict that claimed thousands of lives has recently finished due to an agreement that could have to be torn up. And it was maybe five minutes at the end of a half-hour Brexit chat.”It feels more or less the same now, she says, “and meanwhile the DUP are basically in government”. I remark that, for a younger generation, whose lives and understanding of Irish history have been imbued with the conflict, and who believed that it had been resolved, the idea that anyone would allow peace to be threatened must seem like madness. “I think we’re in that position a lot!” she laughs.Back to the writing. With two books out so quickly, is a third on the horizon? “I’m working on something,” she says, explaining that it only began life at the end of a recent summer holiday with her partner, a teacher. “And I honestly feel so much happier. When I’m writing something everything falls into place. When I’m not writing, stuff keeps happening to me and there’s nowhere to put it all.”I wonder if she feels any kind of pressure to branch out, to write something set in a different milieu or time. She assures me that a thriller, or a work of historical fiction, will not be forthcoming (“The idea of having to …” she says, and trails off). But that’s not to say that there isn’t a certain degree of self-scrutiny. “A lot of the time I read something I’ve written and I think, well, that’s competent, it’s not exactly breaking any boundaries, it’s not exactly transgressive. It’s just a bunch of fake people in a room talking to each other. But maybe there’s a value to that … ” I point out that Jane Austen’s novels could be described as fake people talking in a room, and we briefly mention Henry James. The key, she thinks, might be “finding something you can do well, and accepting that, but not forcing yourself to take on other people’s ambitions for you”.But it is clear that Rooney intends to keep on writing, however large or small her canvas becomes. And it’s also evident that the desire to write is its own reward. “There’s an open question, isn’t there? Why even read fiction now at this historical moment? And I can’t answer that.”But it’s not your job to answer.“No, it’s not. And I feel that I have to be very clear on that. I’m not writing to encourage people to read my book or even books in general. That’s not my job. My job is to write them. And if people want to read them, that’s great.“I feel like it’s tough to toe that line. I’m not trying to denigrate my work. But at the same time, I’m not making any claims for it. It is what it is.” • Sally Rooney’s Normal People is published by Faber. Normal People by Sally Rooney (Faber \u0026amp Faber, £14.99).

According to the French pilot and author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: “He who would travel happily must travel light.”But now, even a case small enough to fit an aircraft’s overhead locker does not guarantee a passenger’s happiness.From November, Ryanair will only permit cases in the cabin for those who pay a £6 priority boarding fee. Other passengers will now have to pay £8 online to check a small wheeled case into the hold. Just one small bag, to fit under the seat in front, will be freely permitted. Coming from an airline that has failed to shake a reputation for giving nothing away, the new rules have provoked angry reaction online and accusations of cynical profiteering. Ryanair, however, insists the aim is to cut delays caused by passengers scrambling to stow luggage, which have kept planes on the tarmac too long for tight airline schedules.While checked-in baggage revenues have been an important stream of income, the Irish airline has already cut the high fees it once espoused. The changes, it says, will not make money: indeed, the new £8 price for a sub-10kg checked-in suitcase may encourage some to pack lighter and avoid fees of £25 or more to put a heavier case in the hold.Edmond Rose, an aviation consultant whose past jobs include director of revenue at Virgin Atlantic, says: “There’s no doubt that when you’re charging for checked baggage it is a money raiser – because the cost of handling is an awful lot less than the prices airlines charge. And passengers have adapted their habits to match. They were encouraged to bring bags into the cabin when airlines separated out checked luggage charges in order to advertise rock-bottom headline fares.Budget airlines have spread across the world in a symbiotic relationship with the small wheeled case, whose widespread use is often dated back to the Rollaboard, invented by a pilot in 1987, in a modern aviation culture of short breaks and minimal costs. And passengers have turned the tables on the bean-counters to the point where Ryanair’s finance director last year bemoaned the sight of toddlers with wheelies, the result of passengers who weren’t “playing by the rules” and “taking the piss”.However galling that sight may have been, the bigger factor ultimately appears to be the wheelie’s threat to turnaround times of as brief as 25 minutes between flights, which are central to budget airline economics. “There’s a bit of money in it, but punctuality and quick boarding is more important, not having passengers blocking everyone else while they wrestle to make a bit of space in the overhead,” says Rose. “What’s interesting with cabin baggage is that airlines keep trying different ways to allow it or charge for it – it keeps swinging around.”The Hungarian airline Wizz initially charged for all cabin bags, before abandoning the policy last year. British Airways and Virgin have marketed some fares for hand-luggage only, rather than appear to charge extra for checking bags, but both have generous carry-on allowances. Ryanair is now abandoning a recent rule change that allowed wheeled cases to be taken at the gate and put in the aircraft hold for free.A spokesman for London Stansted airport, Ryanair’s biggest UK base, said summer shifts on the frontline had shown that something had to change. “The policy of putting cases in the hold at the boarding gate was a false economy, in terms of the efforts involved at the gate and the impact it was having on flight delays.”The baggage picture is further complicated by Ryanair’s own contracts with airports: it relaxed its more stringent clampdowns on carry-ons in 2013 to get preferential terms at Stansted, promising more passengers shopping in airport shops. Although the airline doesn’t spell it out for passengers, it will still allow those duty-free shopping bags on board as well.Last year, rival easyJet lowered charges significantly for smaller checked-in bags, weighing under 15kg. It also launched a “hands free” service, designed to encourage passengers already at the airport to check in small cases, rather than drag them through security and on to the plane, for a £5 fee. From a different angle, with typical controversy, Ryanair may well have ended up in a similar place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234180e7b5a58efdaf9333d98ddb9820bcecbca6/716_947_4468_2680/master/4468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74ed419120302a677f1e517aba0a3c4e","title":"uzbekistan secret underground tashkent metro in pictures","story":"After the ban on photographing the Tashkent metro in Uzbekistan was lifted this summer, Amos Chapple, RFERL’s photographer went underground to reveal the art, architecture and nuclear-blast protection in Central Asia’s oldest subway system"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3f7b7a1b11d191ab7ffc64f2bcdb1933764190/0_0_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26f28f529c146400dda66324c5249b2f","title":"calm amid the concrete britains best urban green spaces","story":"From shopping centre beehives to grand hidden gardens, there’s respite from the madding crowds in Britain’s towns and citiesDalston Eastern Curve Garden, LondonThis leafy lifeline, situated slap bang in the middle of Dalston’s lively chicken shops, boutique bars and technicolor nail salons, is a vital addition to one of London’s most densely populated boroughs, where few people have access to their own garden. Created in 2010 on the site of the old Eastern Curve railway line, it has a vegetable and herb patch, a pizza oven and a greenhouse used for workshops in the winter months.Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden, LeedsDespite the name, Hyde Park in Leeds has one of the lowest ratios of green space to grey (built-up environments) in the UK, which is why the Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden is so loved by students and locals alike. Whether edible or medicinal, all of the plants here have a use, and visitors are encouraged to take what they find – with a request that they give something back to the initiative in their spare time. A word of advice: take one of their foraging courses before you go picking the mushrooms.Crook Hall, DurhamFirm favourites of Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and John Ruskin – and those guys knew a thing or two about nature – the wild garden of one of the oldest houses in Durham has two hectares of wildflower meadows, an ivy-hung courtyard, a maze, and even a moat.

Sushi, swing by this soothing meditation garden, complete with Japanese-inspired water features, pagodas, crystals and koi-carp-filled ponds. Created more than 30 years ago by Buddhist monk Maitreya, who still runs personal meditation classes, the garden is the setting for magical events, from Japanese tea ceremonies to lamplit evening concerts.St John’s Gardens, ManchesterFormerly the site of a graveyard, this mini oasis for city workers, visitors and locals boasts an urban orchard of crab apple trees, manicured flowerbeds and Manchester poplars to shade under. There are also plenty of benches for you to recuperate on after you’ve wandered around the Museum of Science and Industry next door.Goldney Gardens, BristolThis ornate 18th-century garden, tucked behind Goldney House in Clifton Wood, is hiding some big secrets behind its ordinary-looking stone walls. And what might those be, you ask? There’s a heritage orchard, an ornamental garden, an orangery, a rotunda and bastion, for starters. Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment. Tours of Goldney Gardens are run on various dates throughout the summer till 23 August and can be booked online.Bonnington Square Pleasure Garden, LondonOnce part of the 17th-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, this plot of land became a bombsite, then a derelict playground dominated by dog poo, before it was imaginatively re-designed in the 1990s by a group of local residents, led by film-maker Evan English. It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook.

We need a new literacy for the digital ageLook around on your next plane trip. The iPad is the new pacifier for babies and toddlers.\u0026nbspYounger school-aged\u0026nbspchildren read stories on smartphones older boys don’t read\u0026nbspat all, but hunch over video games. Parents and other passengers read on Kindles or skim a flotilla of email and news feeds. Unbeknownst to most of us, an invisible, game-changing transformation links everyone in this picture: the neuronal circuit that underlies the brain’s ability to read is subtly, rapidly changing - a change with implications for everyone from the pre-reading toddler to the expert adult.As work in neurosciences indicates, the acquisition of literacy necessitated a new circuit in our species’ brain more than 6,000 years ago.\u0026nbspThat circuit\u0026nbspevolved from a very simple\u0026nbspmechanism\u0026nbspfor decoding basic information,\u0026nbsplike the number of goats\u0026nbspin one’s herd, to the present,\u0026nbsphighly elaborated reading brain. My research depicts how the present reading brain enables the development of some of our most important intellectual and affective processes: internalized knowledge, analogical reasoning, and inference perspective-taking and empathy critical analysis and the generation of insight. Research surfacing in many parts of the world now cautions that each of these essential “deep reading” processes may be under threat as we move into digital-based modes of reading.This is not a simple, binary issue of print vs digital reading and technological innovation. As MIT scholar Sherry Turkle\u0026nbsphas written, we do not\u0026nbsperr\u0026nbspas a society when we innovate, but when we ignore what we disrupt or diminish\u0026nbspwhile innovating. In this hinge moment between print and digital cultures, society needs to confront what is diminishing in the expert reading circuit, what our children and older students are not developing, and what we can do about it.We know from research that the reading circuit is not given to human beings through a genetic blueprint like vision or language\u0026nbspit needs an environment to develop. Further, it will adapt to that environment’s requirements – from different writing systems to the characteristics of whatever medium is used. If the dominant medium advantages processes that are fast, multi-task oriented and well-suited for large volumes of information, like the current digital medium, so will the reading circuit. As UCLA psychologist Patricia Greenfield writes, the result is that less attention and time will be allocated to slower, time-demanding deep reading processes, like inference, critical analysis and empathy, all of which\u0026nbspare indispensable to\u0026nbsplearning at any age.Increasing reports from educators and from researchers in psychology and the humanities bear this out. English literature scholar and teacher Mark Edmundson describes how many college students actively avoid the classic literature of the 19th\u0026nbspand 20th\u0026nbspcenturies because they no longer have the patience to read longer, denser, more difficult texts. We should be less concerned with students’ “cognitive impatience,”\u0026nbsphowever,\u0026nbspthan by what may underlie it: the potential inability of large numbers of students to read with a level of critical analysis sufficient to comprehend the complexity of thought and argument found in more demanding texts, whether in literature and science in college, or in wills, contracts\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspthe deliberately confusing\u0026nbsppublic referendum questions citizens encounter in the voting booth.Multiple studies show\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspdigital screen use\u0026nbspmay be causing\u0026nbspa variety of troubling downstream effects on reading comprehension in older high school and college students. In Stavanger, Norway, psychologist Anne Mangen and her colleagues studied\u0026nbsphow high school students comprehend the same material\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspdifferent mediums. Mangen’s group asked\u0026nbspsubjects questions about a short story whose plot had\u0026nbspuniversal student appeal (a lust-filled, love story) half of the students read\u0026nbspJenny, Mon Amour\u0026nbspon a Kindle, the other half in paperback. Results indicated that students who read on print were superior in their comprehension to screen-reading peers, particularly in their ability to sequence detail and reconstruct the plot in chronological order.Ziming Liu from San Jose State University has conducted a series of studies which indicate that the “new norm” in reading is\u0026nbspskimming, with word-spotting and browsing through the text. Many readers now use an F or Z pattern when reading in which they sample the first line and then word-spot through the rest of the text.\u0026nbspWhen\u0026nbspthe reading brain skims\u0026nbsplike this, it reduces\u0026nbsptime allocated to deep reading processes. In other words, we don’t have time to grasp complexity, to understand another’s feelings, to perceive beauty, and to create thoughts of the reader’s own.Karin Littau and Andrew Piper\u0026nbsphave noted\u0026nbspanother dimension: physicality. Piper, Littau and Anne Mangen’s group emphasize that the sense of touch in print reading adds an important redundancy to information – a kind of “geometry” to words, and a spatial “thereness” for text. As Piper notes, human beings need a knowledge of where they are in time and space that allows them to return to things and learn from re-examination – what he calls the “technology of recurrence”. The importance of recurrence for\u0026nbspboth\u0026nbspyoung and older readers\u0026nbspinvolves the ability to go back, to check and evaluate one’s understanding of\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsptext. The question, then, is\u0026nbspwhat happens\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspcomprehension when our youth skim on a screen whose lack of spatial thereness discourages “looking back.”US media researchers Lisa Guernsey and Michael Levine, American University’s linguist Naomi Baron, and cognitive scientist Tami Katzir from Haifa University\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbspexamined\u0026nbspthe effects of different\u0026nbspinformation\u0026nbspmediums, particularly on the young. Katzir’s research\u0026nbsphas found\u0026nbspthat the negative effects of screen reading can appear as early as fourth and fifth grade -\u0026nbspwith implications\u0026nbspnot only\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspcomprehension, but also on the growth of empathy.The possibility that critical analysis, empathy and other deep reading processes could become the unintended “collateral damage” of\u0026nbspour\u0026nbspdigital culture is not a simple binary issue about print vs digital reading. It is about how we all have begun to read on any medium and how that changes not only what we read, but also the purposes for why we read. Nor is it only about the young. The subtle atrophy of critical analysis and empathy affects us all.\u0026nbspIt affects\u0026nbspour ability to navigate a constant bombardment of\u0026nbspinformation.\u0026nbspIt incentivizes a\u0026nbspretreat to the most familiar silos of unchecked information,\u0026nbspwhich\u0026nbsprequire and receive no analysis, leaving us susceptible to false information and demagoguery.There’s an old rule in neuroscience that does not alter with age: use it or lose it. It is a very hopeful principle when applied to critical thought in the reading brain because it implies\u0026nbspchoice. The story of the changing reading brain is hardly finished.

There is another wayBut calls for us all to switch entirely to plant-based foods ignore one of the most powerful tools we have to mitigate these ills: grazing and browsing animals.Rather than being seduced by exhortations to eat more products made from industrially grown soya, maize and grains, we should be encouraging sustainable forms of meat and dairy production based on traditional rotational systems, permanent pasture and conservation grazing. We should, at the very least, question the ethics of driving up demand for crops that require high inputs of fertiliser, fungicides, pesticides and herbicides, while demonising sustainable forms of livestock farming that can restore soils and bioersity, and sequester carbon.In 2000, my husband and I turned our 1,400-hectare (3,500-acre) farm in West Sussex over to extensive grazing using free-roaming herds of old English longhorn cattle, Tamworth pigs, Exmoor ponies and red and fallow deer as part of a rewilding project. For 17 years we had struggled to make our conventional arable and dairy business profitable, but on heavy Low Weald clay, we could never compete with farms on lighter soils. The decision turned our fortunes around. Now eco-tourism, rental of post-agricultural buildings, and 75 tonnes a year of organic, pasture-fed meat contribute to a profitable business. And since the animals live outside all year round, with plenty to eat, they do not require supplementary feeding and rarely need to see the vet.The animals live in natural herds and wander wherever they please. They wallow in streams and water-meadows. They rest where they like (they disdain the open barns left for them as shelter) and eat what they like. The cattle and deer graze on wildflowers and grasses but they also browse among shrubs and trees. The pigs rootle for rhizomes and even e for swan mussels in ponds. The way they graze, puddle and trample stimulates vegetation in different ways, which in turn creates opportunities for other species, including small mammals and birds.Crucially, because we don’t dose them with avermectins (the anti-worming agents routinely fed to livestock in intensive systems) or antibiotics, their dung feeds earthworms, bacteria, fungi and invertebrates such as dung beetles, which pull the manure down into the earth. This is a vital process of ecosystem restoration, returning nutrients and structure to the soil. Soil loss is one of the greatest catastrophes facing the world today. A 2015 report from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization states that, globally, 25 to 40bn tonnes of topsoil are lost annually to erosion, thanks mainly to ploughing and intensive cropping. In the UK topsoil depletion is so severe that in 2014 the trade magazine Farmers Weekly announced we may have only 100 harvests left. Letting arable land lie fallow and returning it to grazed pasture for a period – as farmers used to, before artificial fertilisers and mechanisation made continuous cropping possible – is\u0026nbspthe only way to reverse that process, halt erosion and rebuild soil, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. The grazing livestock not only provide farmers with an income, but the animals’ dung, urine and even the way they graze, accelerates soil restoration. The key is to be organic, and keep livestock numbers low to prevent over-grazing.Twenty years ago, our soils at the farm – severely degraded after decades of ploughing and chemical inputs – were almost biologically dead. Now we have fruiting fungi and orchids appearing in our former arable fields: an indication that subterranean networks of mycorrhizal fungi are spreading. We have 19 types of earthworm – keystone species responsible for aerating, rotavating, fertilising, hydrating and even detoxifying the soil. We’ve found 23 species of dung beetle in a single cowpat, one of which – the violet dor beetle – hasn’t been seen in Sussex for 50 years. Birds that feed on insects attracted by this nutritious dung are rocketing. The rootling of the pigs provides opportunities for native flora and shrubs to germinate, including sallow, and this has given rise to the biggest colony of purple emperors in Britain, one of our rarest butterflies, which lays its eggs on sallow leaves.Not only does this system of natural grazing aid the environment in terms of soil restoration, bioersity, pollinating insects, water quality and flood mitigation – but it also it guarantees healthy lives for the animals, and they in turn produce meat that is healthy for us. In direct contrast to grain-fed and grain-finished meat from intensive systems, wholly pasture-fed meat is high in beta carotene, calcium, selenium, magnesium\u0026nbspand potassium and vitamins E and B, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) – a powerful anti-carcinogen. It is also high in the long-chain omega-3 fatty acid DHA, which is vital for human brain development but\u0026nbspextremely difficult for vegans to obtain.So there’s a huge responsibility here: unless you’re sourcing your vegan products specifically from organic, “no-dig” systems, you are actively participating in the destruction of soil biota, promoting a system that deprives other species, including small mammals, birds and reptiles, of the conditions for life, and significantly contributing to climate change.Our ecology evolved with large herbivores – with free-roaming herds of aurochs (the ancestral cow), tarpan (the original horse), elk, bear, bison, red deer, roe deer, wild boar and millions of beavers. They are species\u0026nbspwhose interactions with the environment sustain and promote life. Using herbivores as part of the farming cycle can go a long way towards making agriculture sustainable.There’s no question we should all be eating far less meat, and calls for an end to high-carbon, polluting, unethical, intensive forms of grain-fed meat production are commendable. But if your concerns as a vegan are the environment, animal welfare and your own health, then it’s no longer possible to pretend that these are all met simply by giving up meat and dairy. Counterintuitive as it may seem, adding the occasional organic, pasture-fed steak to your diet could be the right\u0026nbspway to square the circle.• Isabella Tree runs Knepp Castle Estate with her husband, the conservationist Charlie Burrell, and is the author of Wilding: The Return of Nature to a British Farm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626ded69ff5f19135c396f93b59f897d03d5c98a/0_85_7073_4244/master/7073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a6ba5f91eb5197782c7f35d8da90387","title":"don letts windrush stirred up some deep emotions i walked down the street practically crying","story":"The son of Jamaican immigrants, the musician and film-maker was energised by punk and the Notting Hill carnival in the 70s. But the Windrush scandal has left him deeply concerned about Britain’s futureIn the mid-70s, when Don Letts was a young man being frequently trailed through the streets by police, he would stop his car, jump up on the roof and stand, arms outstretched, Jesus-like. He leaps up in the garden of his London home, replicating the pose. “I’d go: ‘Why are you guys crucifying me?’ And I’d start taking my clothes off,” he says. “You know why I did that? To get people to start looking. The minute you’ve got an audience, the cops don’t know what to do.” The “sus law” – police powers to stop and search anyone considered to be suspicious (ie, young black men) – was in full effect and this was the most extreme of Letts’ tactics. Most of the time, he would just leave the house half an hour early “because I’d probably get stopped on the way. You know what’s really sad about it? You expected it – it was normal.”Until, he says, bouncing up on his feet, “enough was enough”. The riots at the Notting Hill carnival in 1976 were triggered by experiences such as his. “Everyone thinks it was a race riot, but it wasn’t a black-and-white thing, it was a right-and-wrong thing. The previous year, the trust between the black community and the police had broken down, primarily because of the sus law. We were pissed off and frustrated. Until that point, you just thought it was part of the deal it was the way things were.”There is that memorable photograph of Letts at the 1976 carnival, a slight, young man walking towards a line of police (it was used on the cover of the Clash compilation album Black Market Clash). The picture is a bit of a lie, he says. It looks as if he is a lone figure, about to confront the police. “What it doesn’t show is the thousands of brothers behind me about to kick off. I’m thinking: ‘Hmm, I better get out of the way.’ Don Letts ain’t stupid. I’m a lover, not a fighter.”Was he there when the riots happened? “Fucking right I was. It wasn’t about hurting anybody, it was about frustration, letting that valve off the pressure cooker. It was necessary to let people know that we were fed up with being treated like this.”If Letts – DJ, musician, film-maker, cultural fixture, raconteur – seems to have gone through life being in the right place at the right time, it’s down to his intelligence, talent and energy that he was able to make the most of every opportunity. He was the 14-year-old who sneaked off in his school uniform to a Who rehearsal and stood feet from the stage – close enough to see the whites of Keith Moon’s eyes. He befriended Bob Marley and hung out with Andy Warhol he was at the birth of punk in the UK and in the early years of hip-hop in the US. Of course, he was filming the 1976 carnival riots with his Super 8 camera. Where else would he have been?The Notting Hill carnival is on this weekend Letts has been going for close to 50 years, since his first at the age of 14. “That was about the time the Jamaican sound systems had kind of hijacked the event,” he says. “Before that, it was the music of the smaller islands that had dominated – calypso and soca from Barbados and Trinidad. Jamaican sound systems took over, which reflected the change in the cultural climate. There was the rise of the National Front, the black community was feeling a lot of pressure from the police. By the early- to mid-70s, carnival had become more of an expression of how my generation felt about being in this country. It was a really confusing concept.” The first time he went, he says, “I just remember being elated, being surrounded by a lot of black people, having a good time and not getting any trouble from the police. In those days, there were very few cops there and it was good to have two days of the year that were ours – you weren’t feeling the pressure and you could maybe light up a joint in front of the local bobby and he’d turn a blind eye.”It was never meant to be just a party, he says, going over its history, from its creation in 1959 in St Pancras town hall by the Trinidadian activist Claudia Jones as a way to provide strength and solidarity following race riots the previous year, then moving to Notting Hill in the early 60s after the murder of Kelso Cochrane, a young black man. It was political. And now? “It has undoubtedly become a massive party, but that’s true of culture around the world generally,” says Letts. “People, offered the choice between thinking or partying, they’re all partying. Why do you think the culture is so thin in the 21st century? Although they’re waking up now.” Letts likes to pace as he talks. And he talks and talks. About his kids (he has two teenage daughters and two grownup children from a previous relationship): “I’m middle-class, I guess, and the downside of that is I’ve raised some spoilt kids. They listen to shit music, they’re totally tied to their screens.” And about whether or not, at the age of 62, he feels old: “You pretend you don’t, but when I’m DJing at 4am, sometimes I’m like: ‘What am I doing?’” He works prolifically – he has a show on BBC 6 Music and recently launched a new series of his Reggae 45 podcasts, this time celebrating 50 years of the influential label Trojan Records and a history of carnival. Some of his friends have started retiring. “I don’t understand what that means.”Letts was born and raised in south London. His parents were Windrush generation immigrants from Jamaica his father worked as a bus driver and his mother was a seamstress. A month ago, Letts curated an event at Somerset House in London – “about as white a place as you can get” – to celebrate the impact of Jamaican bass culture on the UK. It also featured the artists Congo Natty, Wylie, Jazzie B and Norman Jay. All except Natty have been awarded an MBE or OBE, Letts points out. “On one hand, they’re giving the children of Windrush these awards and on the other hand they’re kicking out our parents because they have done their job and we don’t need them any more,” says Letts. When the Windrush scandal broke – people who had been living in the UK for decades began being detained or deported – Letts says it “stirred up some very deep emotions. I walked down the street practically crying, thinking about it all.”His parents came to the UK in 1955. “The way they tried to get on in society was to deny their roots, try to Anglicise themselves,” says Letts. “They tried to speak proper English, eat English food, with the promise of this multicultural dream, but it was a trick. Growing up as a teenager, I realised my parents’ generation were basically being fucked over and they weren’t happy. They were never accepted.”He grew up listening to his parents’ music – his father had a small sound system and would play it on a Sunday afternoon after church – and the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin that his white friends were into. “It was only through music that I really began to find any inner strength. I was being turned on by white music, but I wasn’t being told anything about who I was.” Instead, he discovered dub reggae.These were the records Letts played at the Roxy, the punk venue whose scene had grown out of Acme Attractions, the counterculture shop Letts was running in Chelsea, whose reggae sound system attracted artists such as the Clash, Patti Smith and the Sex Pistols. Punk was still so new that there weren’t many records to play, but Letts gave them reggae and they “obviously liked the basslines, they liked the fact that the music was anti-establishment and had a reportage quality. And they didn’t mind the weed. There was this cultural exchange going on.”Would punk be accused of cultural appropriation today? “Nothing comes out of a void,” he says. “The crucial thing is: is it inspiration or exploitation? If you’re fairly together, it’s easy to see the difference between the two. It’s a messy thing and it’s hard to have blanket conversations about it, but undoubtedly there are aspects where certain corporations have gone into overdrive to milk black culture.”Letts loved punk – the politics, the spirit. “I think punk rock’s greatest gift was the whole DIY ethos,” he says. “This energy was happening all around me and it was so intense that you wanted to be involved.” He picked up a camera and became the Clash’s film-maker, behind films including The Punk Rock Movie (1978) and, in 2000, the Grammy award-winning The Clash: Westway to the World. He also made videos for artists including Elvis Costello and the Pretenders. He managed the Slits and cofounded Big Audio Dynamite with the Clash’s Mick Jones, co-writing the songs, even though he couldn’t play an instrument (stickers on his keyboard told him which notes to play).At the beginning of this century, he was despairing that it felt like punk had never happened. “A lot of music today has become this kind of soundtrack to passive consumerism,” he says. “I grew up on music that kept you emotionally and politically engaged with each other – and you could party to it, too.”Where are the rebels now, he asks. “If you want to be on the red carpet, on the MTV awards show, how radical can you be? How radical can you be when you’re living with your mum until you’re 30.” London, he says, “will fucking kill you. I think young people have to get over the London thing and think about new places of creative growth. It has become an economically walled city. I do feel for them. When I was growing up, there were cracks you could operate in – squatting for instance.”But he adds, “I have noticed in the last five years a change.” Grime, the genre that comes closest to punk’s influence, with its disruption and politics, he says, “gives me hope”. Still, he is appalled by the “slow erosion” of society and rights, and the discourse that has led to everything from the rise of nationalism and “fucking Brexit”, to the Grenfell disaster to the Windrush injustices. “We need to look at our part in the whole process and why all this shit’s going on, where we have not been vigilant.”Don Letts’ Culture Clash Radio is on BBC 6 Music on Sundays at 10pm.

So is this film, which recounts a 2004 heist in Lexington, Kentucky, a drama or a documentary? Onscreen interviews with the criminals themselves – four bored young men who hatched a plot to steal valuable books (including Darwin’s On the Origin of Species) – tip the balance in favour of documentary. On the other hand, the film features fictionalised versions of the same people played by an able young cast, as well as the sort of glossy cinematography and adrenalised score one would expect from a high-calibre heist movie. The real-life subjects even interact occasionally with their surrogates. In one scene, Evan Peters, who plays the ringleader Warren Lipka, sits beside the real Lipka in a car and asks: “Is this how it happened?” The effect is rather as if Pirandello had made Reservoir Dogs. More than that, it demonstrates the unstable shape of documentary in the age of alternative facts.Fiction cinema acknowledged as far back as Citizen Kane that there is no such thing as definitive truth when it comes to storytelling the documentary genre has taken rather longer to reach the same conclusion. The turning point was Errol Morris’s 1988 film The Thin Blue Line, which incorporated reconstructions based on differing statements in a murder case, and felt as much like a thriller as a documentary. Daring hybrids in the last 15 years or so have made the genre a breeding ground for mischief and ambiguity. Joshua Oppenheimer’s 2012 The Act of Killing invites murderous Indonesian gangsters and paramilitaries to restage their own appalling crimes, all in the style of their favourite movies. In Stories We Tell, from the same year, the actor-turned-director Sarah Polley explores the subject of her own paternity while laying bare the fabrications of the form: we see her coaching her father on reading his lines, making him start again if he fluffs one. Two British landmarks – Clio Barnard’s The Arbor, where actors lip-synch eerily to recordings of real people, and Carol Morley’s Dreams of a Life, which uses reconstruction and speculation – have also played their part in muddying the waters.American Animals takes the confusion further. Bart Layton, its British writer-director, has a background in documentary his hit 2012 film The Imposter, about a family duped by a conman, also straddled the line between genres. “I don’t tend to worry about categories,” he tells me. “For me, it’s all about finding the best way to tell the story. We’ve all had that experience where you see ‘based on a true story’ at the start of a film, and you get that sinking feeling. You’re waiting for the photos of the real people at the end, and you know that everything will be wildly Hollywood-ised. With American Animals, I wanted to see if there was a new way to tell a true story. It’s definitely not a documentary but nor is it a straight fictionalising. The facts were outlandish enough without the need to invent anything.” Poppy Dixon, one of the producers, visited the subjects back in 2010 when they were still serving time. “My job was to put them at ease. When we explained how Bart wanted to tell their story, they thought it sounded cool.”She believes the unique texture of the film makes it well-placed to comment on the nature of memory. “Sure, there’s Donald Trump’s idea of truth. But we all recognise that we have imperfect memories. It’s honest to represent that, and the particular form of American Animals allows this to happen.”Layton embraced the discrepancies in his subjects’ accounts: “I wanted to be clear from the beginning that these are some pretty unreliable narrators,” he says. Audiences who smelt a rat in Catfish or were duped by the Joaquin Phoenix mockumentary I’m Still Here may find it refreshing to see a film which confesses openly to its own irregularities.“The financiers were nervous about the nonfiction bits,” Layton says. “They were wondering if I was going to take what could be a commercial movie and spoil it with these documentary elements. My feeling was that once you see the real people, you’ve got skin in the game. However far the characters go, you know it all really happened.”Layton is not the only filmmaker currently blurring the distinctions between fiction and reality. He singles out Chloé Zhao’s The Rider, which casts a real-life rodeo rider and his family and friends as themselves in a retelling of events from his life – an approach that has been a mainstay of Iranian cinema since the 1980s. “It’s really rich and unusual,” Layton notes. “You don’t see those faces on screen normally, and you can see they’re not actors.”The Australian filmmaker Kitty Green is also a pioneer in the genre. Her 2017 Netflix film Casting JonBenet shows actors auditioning for a (nonexistent) film about the unsolved murder of the child beauty-pageant star JonBenét Ramsey.The result is a disturbing collection of their on-camera revelations and their responses to the murder, with Green using fiction as a tool for unearthing intimate emotional truths in the absence of objective ones.Of course, there’s a risk that cross-breeds such as American Animals, The Rider and Casting JonBenet could leave conventional documentaries looking impoverished. “I don’t know if anyone’s done quite what Bart does,” Dixon says. “I’m not sure if anyone’s been brave enough. But it’s a challenge to documentary-makers, isn’t it? A really good true story is always better than a fictional one.”American Animals is released on 7 September, The Rider on 14 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269aa951fec204d1b8828d0238ae640db951c62b/0_73_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=030484285b27ed44fafe92272e616839","title":"james bond 25 yann demange director danny boyle exit","story":"Yann Demange, the London film-maker back in contention for the director’s role on the next James Bond film, is desperate to work in the UK again and says he hopes to capture authentic British banter on screen.Demange, who won international acclaim for his first film, the Belfast thriller ’71, which starred Jack O’Connell, said only that he was “very flattered” by the speculation sparked by last week’s news that director Danny Boyle had dropped out of the 25th Bond film.Days before the premiere of his latest film, the A-list crime drama White Boy Rick, Demange, 41, is back on an elite shortlist of talent under consideration. And in comments that will do nothing to quash the rumours, the director, who grew up in west London but has been working in Hollywood, said he was longing to get back to his roots.“You don’t see enough of the real Britishness on screen, the banter,” he said. “I love the way we deal with things through humour. I am desperate to get back home and make something with some of that in it.”His main concern, he said, was to work in London again. “I want to make London films of the kind we don’t yet see. Not necessarily gritty, but something that gets across the otherness and is perhaps filmed only half in English. Let’s be honest about the people who live in London.”Demange, who is half French and half Algerian, is now filming a big budget HBO series, outside Chicago,  while he awaits the premiere of his second feature film at the prestigious Toronto film festival this month.Starring Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey, Bruce Dern and Jennifer Jason Leigh, White Boy Rick tells the true story of Rick Wershe Jnr, a notorious teenage drugs dealer and police informant, and is set in the gangland world of Detroit. Wershe was from the city’s deteriorating east side, an area that saw a huge boom in criminality and crack addiction during the 1980s as car factory jobs disappeared.“Detroit is a landscape, post ‘white flight’, that fascinated me,” said Demange. “After all, it was originally the poster child for the American dream of capitalist expansion.”The director was in Los Angeles, developing an American version of a film he had planned to make about the Brixton riots of the 1980s, when he was approached about the project. “I was asked out and I didn’t want to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I put aside the riot film after I read about Wershe’s incredible story. I was really interested in the relationship between the father and son,” he said.McConaughey plays Richard Wershe Snr, a small-time gun dealer who justifies his life of crime as a patriotic response to the second amendment right to bear arms. “This dad wants to be a buddy rather than a father, and yet he is judgmental about selling drugs. He is a bit of a Del-Boy Trotter really, although over here they think of him as like Willy Loman, from Arthur Miller’s Death of A Salesman.”The new film also stars British actors Eddie Marsan and Bel Powley, alongside 85-year-old Hollywood star Piper Laurie. Newcomer Richie Merritt plays Rick.“Casting a first-time actor was a risk, but I didn’t want a suburban boy who has just listened to a lot of rap. I wanted someone who has it in his DNA. Richie grew up in a similar world to Wershe and went to a largely black school. He has had to deal with a lot and he knows pain,” said Demange, who visited the real Wershe in prison several times.Wershe was jailed aged 17 in 1988 due to a subsequently repealed Michigan law that imposed an automatic life sentence on anyone caught with at least 650g of cocaine. “I am not sure I want to do a true story again,” said Demange, “because once you have met the people actually involved you feel you can’t do some of the things you might have dreamed of on screen.”After early British television work that included Secret Diary of a Call Girl and the Charlie Brooker zombie drama Dead Set, Demange made the hit east London crime series Top Boy, written by Ronan Bennett, which went out on Channel 4 in 2011. A new series, overseen by Demange, is now being made for Netflix.Speculation on the next Bond film was sparked when it emerged that Boyle had left the project due to “creative differences” and that the film’s scheduled release date had been put back. Other hotly-tipped directors for Daniel Craig’s final outing as Bond include the Canadian Denis Villeneuve director of Sicario and David Mackenzie, the Scottish director of Hell or High Water. Christopher Nolan, director of Inception and Dunkirk, has also indicated he might be interested in a future reboot of the action franchise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9698903d5ec6a71dde47d4e126f4afb5bee2fbbc/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e5d6c1bbee97f08fa1f553d44765cab","title":"the children act film review preposterous plot","story":"The writing of Ian McEwan – he adapted this screenplay from his own novel – is sophisticated and rewarding. It is also, arguably, one of the main problems with a film that manages to be both wholly persuasive and utterly preposterous.There is no questioning the angular complexity of the central character study, with all its unexpected harmonics and discords. Eminent high court judge Fiona Maye (superbly inhabited by Emma Thompson) is given to brusque certainties – her decisions in life are as final and binding as those she makes in court. There is a steely elegance to her she’s an ermine robe with the claws still showing. Fiona is dedicated to and consumed by her job, at the expense of her marriage to academic Jack (Stanley Tucci). There’s a terrific scene early on when Jack is trying to tempt her away from work – a ruling on a pair of conjoined twins – with offers of dinner and theatre tickets. Fiona, oblivious, reads aloud: “Michael’s heart is normal and sustains them both.” She might as well be describing her marriage. Jack’s announcement that he is planning to have an affair coincides with one of the most difficult cases of her career.Adam (Fionn Whitehead) is a 17-year-old boy who is refusing a life-saving blood transfusion on religious grounds. Fiona takes the unexpected decision to visit him in hospital this brief, intense encounter sears itself into both their lives. She rules that he must receive the transfusion. The piano score tinkles, prim and plaintive.But Adam feels that Fiona’s intervention at this moment links their fates.

Since Burmese food has been relatively hidden from the rest of world, every time I go to the restaurant, I compulsively try everything on the menu in the name of research. One thing I have learned thus far is that the salads are mighty and mouth-watering, and so it is that I offer up my memory of its mango, peanut and lime salad, so you, too, can enjoy this hidden cuisine.When freshly made, this salad is great by itself or with seasoned and fried tofu, but if left a day it will release delicious juices and is wonderful with rice noodles. You can hand-cut the long strips, but a julienne peeler is a perfect time-saving device for this salad. Make sure to buy the hardest, greenest most unripe mangoes you can find in the supermarket, because ripe mangoes will juice when you cut them.Prep 30 minCook 20 minServes 4 with tofu or noodles 2 as it is 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and julienned1 red bird’s-eye chilli, finely chopped5 tbsp lime juice (ie, from 1½ limes) 1 tsp salt Rapeseed oil 1 onion, peeled, halved and thinly sliced 4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced 1½ tbsp chickpea flour 2 tbsp crunchy unsalted peanut butter½ sweetheart cabbage, finely shredded 2 unripe mangoes (500g) 2 medium carrots (200g), peeled and julienned 1 handful mint leaves, chopped 1 handful coriander leaves, chopped 1 large handful (60g) crushed salted roasted peanutsPut the ginger and chilli in a bowl, add the lime juice and salt, and leave to steep.Put a plate by the stove and cover it with kitchen towel. Heat five tablespoons of oil in a nonstick frying pan over a medium flame and, when smoking hot, add the onion. Separate the slices using a wooden spoon and fry, stirring once or twice, until brown and crisp. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and put on the prepared plate. Fry the garlic slices for two minutes in the same pan, until golden brown (be watchful, because they cook quickly), then transfer to the plate.In the remaining hot oil over a very low heat, stir in the chickpea flour to create a paste. Stir constantly for a minute, then add the peanut butter, stir for another minute, then take off the heat.Put the cabbage in a large bowl. Peel the mangoes and shave with a julienne peeler until you hit the stone or, if cutting by hand, cut the cheeks from the stone on all four sides and julienne. Add the mango and carrots to the cabbage with the fried garlic and onions (reserving a handful of onions to garnish), toss, then pour over the chickpea peanut paste and the ginger, chilli and lime mixture, and toss again.

Pep Guardiola’s side had racked up seven successive top flight wins on their travels since drawing at Burnley six months ago but Wolves were in no mood to roll over just because the Premier League champions were in town.Nuno Espírito Santo’s side played with tremendous energy, belief and courage, and deserved a point that was celebrated like a victory at the final whistle. There was a slice of good fortune with Willy Boly’s goal, which went in off the central defender’s arm, but it was hard to begrudge Wolves that bit of luck on a day when they caused City plenty of problems with some superb counterattacking.Aymeric Laporte’s first goal for City, with just over 20 minutes remaining, brought parity and there were opportunities for both teams to win a thrilling game in the closing moments. Diogo Jota flashed a shot inches over, while at the other end Sergio Agüero’s free-kick hit the top of the crossbar.Guardiola would have known that this had the potential to be an awkward test and that was the way it shaped up to be. Wolves spent long periods without the ball but they were certainly not parking the bus and carried a threat whenever they broke forward, in particular on the right flank, where Helder Costa had the beating of Benjamin Mendy, the City left-back.From a defensive point of view, City were their own worst enemy at times, in particular Vincent Kompany, who looked badly out of sorts and was straying close to becoming a danger to his own team. Kompany had already been penalised for a deliberate foul when he cynically brought down Rúben Neves to earn an early booking. Shortly afterwards Kompany tried to bring the ball out of defence but his heavy touch let him down and Wolves were able to counterattack through Jota. Raúl Jiménez swept home at the far post but was correctly flagged offside. Another wayward pass from Kompany later in the first half, as Wolves made life uncomfortable for City by pressing them high up the pitch, completed a difficult opening period for the Belgian.For all that, City still had plenty of moments at the other end where they produced some superb attacking football. Agüero struck the post with a low right-foot shot less than 60 seconds after Jiménez’s goal was ruled out for offside and the combination of the woodwork and some terrific goalkeeping denied City in their very next attack. Controlling the ball on his chest, Raheem Sterling struck a swerving 25-yard half-volley that was arcing towards the top corner when Rui Patrício stretched out his right hand to tip the ball on to the bar. It was an outstanding save.Aside from his disallowed goal, Jiménez had one other chance for Wolves before the interval and may well reflect that he should have shown a bit more composure. About 12 yards out and with the angle against him, the Mexican wildly thrashed at the ball and his shot ended up going out for a throw-in on the far side.It was City, though, who were dominating possession, pushing Wolves back deeper and deeper, in particular in the first 10 minutes of the second half, when it started to feel like a matter of time before they would find a way through. That was the theory, yet Wolves were not following the script.Initially it looked as though Wolves had squandered a great chance to take the lead when Costa, running away from Kompany after Laporte had failed to deal with a routine throw-in, delayed pulling the trigger and saw his shot pushed into the sidenetting by Ederson. But from the corner that followed, João Moutinho played the ball short before getting it back and delivering an inswinging cross that exposed some poor City marking. Matt Doherty got the faintest of touches before Boly, attempting a ing header, nudged the ball over the line with his right arm.The goal was allowed to stand, yet City levelled within 12 minutes. Ilkay Gündogan, who was later replaced by Leroy Sané as Guardiola chased victory, swung in a fine free-kick from the right and Laporte, with a free run at the ball, headed powerfully home.Gabriel Jesus, another City substitute, headed Mendy’s cross straight at Patrício moments later and then came the two late chances for Jota and Agüero."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a106f6a9d929064e54b8c8d8a8e5e6ef4faad49/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31ebb0d58760d8c70513a2af95b1d435","title":"mourinho vs the world and a book writers special football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and Michael Calvin to discuss Liverpool’s perfect start, José Mourinho’s issues with everyone, books, plane banner protests and the joy of chancing across a game in the parkRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Championship: Sheffield United double their lead against Bolton Wanderers at the Macron Stadium, with Kieran Freeman doing the honours. Championship: From the vantage point of his upturned blue bucket, Marcelo Bielsa has just seen Mateusz Klich fire his team ahead against Norwich City at Carrow Road, where the away dressing room has been painted pink in a bid to lower the visiting team’s levels of testosterone. That seems to be working well. Championship: Sheffield Wednesday go one up against Ipswich Town, with Lucas Joao rising highest to head home a Barry Bannan corner in the 16th minute. Huddersfield v Cardiff City: Ben Hamer succumbs to the knee injury he sustained in that collision with Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and is forced off. Jonas Lossl replaces him. Championship: Following his tunnel bust-up with assorted team-mates during the week, James McClean scores his first goal for Stoke. They lead Hull City 1-0.

The physios are on at the John Smith Stadium: Cardiff City’s Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and Huddersfield goalkeeper Ben Hamer have been involved in what seems to have been a sickening collision. Both players are on the ground receiving treatment for knee injuries. Peeeeeeeeeeep!!! Our three o’clock are under way and we’ve a goal in the Championship already. Bristol City have taken a very early lead against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium, with Andreas Weimann getting them off to a dream start.Raised eyebrows in the  sports department: The news that Mesut Ozil is out due to illness has been greeted with scepticism by some of my more cynical colleagues. I wish him a speedy recovery. Premier League: Stuart James was at Molineux to see new boys Wolves take a share of the points against the champions.Everton: Tom Davies comes in to replace the injured Morgan Schneiderlin in central midfield. Bournemouth: Eddie Howe sticks with an unchanged team following their 100 per cent start to the season and there is also a first appearance on the bench for club-record signing Jefferson Lerma.Leicester: Daniel Amartey preferred to Marc Albrighton, while Wes Morgan comes in for Jonny Evans and will make his 600th league appearance.

They took the lead through a contentious Willy Boly goal, only for City to equalise soon after through Aymeric Laporte. City hit the woodwork three times, with Sergio Aguero rattling the cross-bar with a free-kick deep into added time. That’s a fine result for Wolves.Premier League: Parity has been restored at Molineux, where Aymeric Laporte has equalised for Manchester City in the 69th minute.

League One: Peterborough and Portsmouth are top of the pops after four matches, but can feel the hot breath of Barnsley, Sunnderland and Walsall on their necks. At the bottom of the table, Oxford United have yet to win a point and will be relying on the charity of Burton Albion to help get themselves off the mark.The Championship: Middlesbrough went top last night after scoring a late, late winner against West Brom which took them to 13 points from five games. They could be joined at the Championship summit by Leeds and Bolton this evening. Marcelo Bielsa’s side take on Norwich at Carrow Road, while Bolton entertain Sheffield Wednesday.Michael Calvin was our special guest on Thursday’s episode of the ’s Football Weekly podcast.

All that’s left is to direct you to our match report from Stuart James at Molineux ... and remind you that the 3pms are under way, so open another tab for Barry Glendenning’s Clockwatch!Pep talks! “It was a good game. We conceded too many counter attacks. But we created a lot of chances. That is a good point. I compliment Wolves. It is difficult against a good team. We tried, we will improve, because defensively we were not solid. Every game we play we learn for the next one.” Guardiola was also asked whether he thought VAR should be introduced to the Premier League. “It is none of my business.” And was he complaining about the Wolves goal when he had a word with referee Martin Atkinson at the full-time whistle? “No. I was complimenting him on his game.”Nuno speaks! “All the credit is for my players, the way they worked. We knew it was going to be tough, but we played in the shape and style we believed. The players supported each other, it was a very good game. We want to create an identity, you just have to go, no matter who you have in front of you. Recognise the strengths, take advantage of the weaknesses, and prepare yourself to compete. We did very well with the ball, with the amount of chances we created against Manchester City. But the result is not what we want. We want to win! Stay humble, stay humble. It’s just one point!”A disappointed but sporting Kyle Walker talks. “I think we created a lot of chances to put more than one past them. But they’re a well-organised team. It’s going to be very difficult to come here, a lot of teams will come here and drop points. So full credit to them, they deserved the point. We’ve had enough chances. I’ve heard the ball went in off Boly’s hand, but it’s hard for the referees and we just had to go and get the equaliser, which we did. And we could have nicked it at the end. We know it’s going to be tough this season, we need to go again, and dust ourselves down.”Wolves vice-captain Conor Coady speaks to Sky. “It was good. That’s what we’ve got to do in this ision, we have to play really well. They’re a fantastic side, they move the ball fantastically well. But we stuck to our plan really well, showed we can play, and we had a few chances. I think a draw was a fair result. I though we deserved a goal, no matter how it went in, we’ll have to have a look back at it! They’re one of the best football clubs in the world, and we had a go at them. We’re very pleased.”That’s Wolves’ second point of the new Premier League season, and a rare instance of dropped points for Manchester City. Controversy over the Wolves goal, of course - shades of offside and hand ball - and City hit the woodwork three times. The luck wasn’t with them today. And yet on balance, a draw seems the right result. City weren’t quite at their sparkling best, while Wolves announced themselves as a team to be taken very seriously with a resolute performance. They soaked up plenty of City pressure, and attacked the champions with style and purpose too, something not too many teams have managed of late. It was a wonderfully entertaining game. For differing reasons, neither side deserved to lose.And that’s that! A draw, and a fair result. Pep embraces Nuno warmly. It’s no more than Wolves deserve.90 min +5: Aguero takes, and sends the free kick towards the top left. Rui Patricio is beaten all ends up ... but the crossbar comes to Wolves’ rescue! The ball clips off the top of the frame, and out for a goal kick.90 min +4: Sane embarks on a discombobulating dribble down the left, skipping past five challenges from a very tight spot! He lays off for Aguero, who is clipped on the ankle by Moutinho. This is a free kick in a very dangerous position, 25 yards out, just left of centre.90 min +3: Sane crosses from the left. Mahrez heads harmlessly behind.90 min +2: City ping it around the middle of the park again, but Wolves are holding their shape and there’s no way through.90 min +1: Sane balloons the corner straight out of play. On the touchline, Pep frowns and crosses his arms very, very tightly.90 min: Silva feeds Sane down the left. It’s a corner. There will be five minutes of added time.89 min: Nothing comes of the set piece, but City can only half clear. Jota makes his way down the left and whips to the far post, where Doherty heads wide.88 min: Traore again zips down the right, leaving Mendy behind again. He blasts low into the centre for Jimenez, but Kompany slides in to intercept and Laporte slashes out in a panic for a corner.87 min: Traore goes on a power dribble down the right. He walks past Mendy and loops long. Jota chests down and tries to Le Tissier a spectacular shot across Ederson and into the top right. It’s over the bar, but not by much. A fine effort.86 min: A long free kick is launched into the mixer by City. Kompany rises to win a header, but he’s been climbing on the back of an opponent. The resulting free kick is celebrated like a goal. Wolves fans desperate for their team to hold on for a point against the champions.85 min: Jonny is replaced by Ruben Vinagre, while Raheem Sterling makes way for Riyad Mahrez.84 min: Jonny’s up and about again. Sane’s corner leads to another, after which he’s bundled off the ball. He skips about in frustration.82 min: Sterling probes down the right and wins a corner off Jonny, who immediately goes down with cramp. Wolves have worked hard this afternoon. Manchester City have worked them hard.81 min: The game’s got a bit fragmented. Sane dribbles down a blind alley. Laporte launches one long that goes straight through to Rui Patricio.79 min: Corner for Wolves out on the right. Moutinho’s delivery is headed away powerfully by Fernandinho.77 min: City make a second change. Ilkay Gundogan is replaced by Leroy Sane.76 min: City play keep-ball in the middle of the park. Then suddenly Mendy barrels down the left and whips a cross in. Jesus meets it six yards out, heading down powerfully. It looks a certain goal ... but Rui Patricio hacks clear with his feet. That’s some save.74 min: A break in play. Doherty is down after accidentally clashing heads with Jesus. It looks as though he’ll be OK to continue.72 min: Aguero spins down the inside-left channel and sends a snapshot towards the top right. It’s always going wide. And then Wolves make their first change of the afternoon, Helder Costa making way for Adama Traore.70 min: Aguero goes over in the Wolves box, dribbling in from the left and feeling a brush on his shoulder from Moutinho. The referee isn’t interested.Silva wins a free kick just to the right of the Wolves area. Gundogan whips a gorgeous ball to the far post, where Laporte steams in and powers a stunning header into the top left! There was no stopping that, it was a bullet! Laporte’s first goal for City draws the champions level!67 min: A slo-o-o-ow replay of the Wolves goal suggests even more controversy. Moutinho’s cross brushed the head of Doherty, standing just in front of Boly. So Boly was possibly offside as well as using his arm.66 min: Wolves launch a counter attack. Jota races down the left and should be clear on goal, but he miscontrols and is forced wide left, unable to shoot. Instead he waits, and pulls the ball back for Neves, who drags a shot wide left. This is a really entertaining game.65 min: City are coming at Wolves in the relentless style. Silva dances down the left and reaches the byline, but can’t find anyone with his pullback. Then he tees up Gundogan on the edge of the box, but Gundogan’s low bobbler is swallowed by Rui Patricio.63 min: From the corner, the ball pings around the Wolves box awhile. Rui Patricio eventually claims it to loud cheers. This could be a long half hour for Wolves.62 min: A corner for City out on the right. Before it can be taken, Bernardo Silva is replaced by Gabriel Jesus.61 min: A free kick for City out on the left. Bernardo Silva’s delivery is no good. But this is otherwise a fine response to falling behind from the champions.59 min: City come straight back at Wolves. Sterling and David Silva bustle into the area down the right. A few flicks. Neves is right behind Silva as he goes over. Silva wants a penalty ... but he’s not getting one, having kicked his own heel while going over. Silva is beyond livid, sure he’s been barged in the back. He’s booked for complaining.The corner’s worked back down the left flank to Moutinho, who curls a stunning ball to the far post. Boly flies low to meet it with his head and flicks it into the right-hand corner, Ederson rooted to the spot! The ball also flicked Boly’s arm, though that’s not been spotted by the ref ... or even any of the City players, who aren’t complaining.56 min: Kompany and Laporte are snoozing, and allow Costa to barge clear down the inside-left channel. Costa is one on one with Ederson. He hesitates, and Ederson is able to turn his shot around the post for a corner. A chance spurned! But no matter, because ...55 min: Fernandinho has a whack from distance. It’s deflected out for a corner on the left. Gundogan curls one into the box, but it’s easily headed clear by Coady.54 min: City continue to ping it around. Jota again loses his rag and clatters Walker to the floor. Another free kick just outside the Wolves box, but City try a quick one that doesn’t come off.52 min: Wolves can’t get a sniff of the ball. It’s all City. Laporte floats a pass down the inside-right channel, but it’s just a bit too long for David Silva.50 min: More early second-half pressure from City. Aguero slips the ball to Sterling on the left edge of the Wolves box. Sterling drops a shoulder to cut inside, and curls a shot towards the top right. But it’s a wild one. “On a scale of one to Serge Aurier, how badhilarious was Mendy’s foul throw?” asks Adam Kline-Schoder. “Good to know that professional footballers are human too.”48 min: The corner ends up at the feet of Walker, who shoots low and hard from distance. A second corner is the result. Kompany meets it at the far post, but his header is always going high and wide.47 min: City stroke it around for a bit. Jota gets fed up and bowls Aguero over. A free kick, just outside the Wolves area to the right. Gundogan curls in. Coady heads over the bar to concede a corner fine defending seeing the box was teeming with City players.And we’re off again! No changes. City get the ball rolling for the second half. “Can I be proud of a team I do not support?” wonders Ian Copestake. “Is great to see Conor Coady, formerly (for want of a better word) groomed by Liverpool as the next Gerrard, throwing himself into that role with complete conviction.”What’s Jonathan Wilson’s catchphrase again? Goals are over-rated? That’s as good a 45 minutes of goal-free football as you’re likely to see. Really not sure how it’s stayed this way, but here we are. See you soon for another fine 45?45 min: Jimenez withdraws from a 50-50 in midfield with Mendy, and City are away on a quick-break. The ball’s shuttled to Bernardo Silva, who dribbles into the area from the right. He’s got Rui Patricio in his sights, but hesitates a little, and Coady is across quickly to scuff the ball away from danger.44 min: Mendy takes another throw. The Wolves crowd give him pantomime pelters. Then Kompany gives the ball away with a loose pass out of defence ... but Jota can’t take advantage. Kompany has been very sloppy today his passing has been all over the shop.43 min: Costa barges Mendy off the ball, and breezes into the City area from the right. he cuts the ball back for Neves, who unleashes an instant low drive that’s blocked pretty much at source. Then there’s a throw to City out on the left. Mendy takes ... and steps a good yard infield while doing so. Foul throw. Not a great 60 seconds for the City left-back.42 min: Coady is booked for coming through the back of Aguero. He can have no complaints about that one.41 min: City come close again. David Silva slips a pass down the left for Mendy, who hammers a low ball across the face of goal. Rui Patricio parries, but only to Aguero, six yards out. Aguero scuffs his shot, the ball having snagged under his feet, and Rui Patricio smothers. How is this game goalless?40 min: Jimenez has the ball on the edge of the City box. He can’t sort his feet out. City swarm him and the chance is gone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce220a98436aa07c2fa9c6a29689fae7962220c6/0_966_2539_1523/master/2539.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc08815c0410b043c1e42e02d80873bc","title":"11 ways to be more creative","story":"Where do great ideas come from?

The Tiger Who Came To Tea came about when I was trying to entertain my daughter with a bedtime story. Mog, the first of that series, was just about our cat. I’d never had a cat and always wanted one, and it was just about all the things he did, which to me were such a surprise. The Crocodile Under The Bed came about because my children used to think there might be something under the bed. Ideas come in bits and pieces.Judith Kerr’s new book, Mummy Time, is published on 20 September.My creative sparks come at the moment when a meeting is over and everything has been decided and agreed on. Of course, during the meeting – typically, with clients and staff members – we brainstorm and discuss a lot, rapidly and with incentive. Even so, there are times right afterwards that I realise I was wrong and made bad decisions. Then I immediately call the people who were present and tell them I’ve changed my mind, with sincere apologies.I don’t behave like a God-like architect. Being able to say sorry is key to being a designer, and can be a source of inspiration.The V\u0026ampA, Dundee, Scotland’s first design museum, opens on 15 September, vam.ac.ukdundee.It’s putting yourself into unfamiliar worlds that does it, looking at something from a naive perspective. I’m lucky enough to travel a lot. I go to the local museums and like being exposed to the worlds of sculpture or cooking, or music – anything that is not my core area of design.For example, we have a restaurant in London, and when it started, I worked in the kitchen at times. You learn a lot from working in a team. Sometimes putting yourself in a junior position again gives you a different perspective. And sometimes it’s about learning adjacent or oblique skills that may not immediately feed into what I do. In the kitchen, you have a lot of very repetitive activities, like chopping, washing or grating. They become mechanical. You have to concentrate, but it becomes automatic, leaving the mind free to wander. I am always coming back to certain lessons that I have learned over the course of my career:Lesson 1: The worst is the best. (A Sufi saying.)Lesson 2: More and more of less and less.Lesson 3: “What you’re doing is not important, what is important is the state of mind in which you are doing it.” (Constantin BrâncuȘi)Lesson 4: Don’t be afraid to make mistakes.There is something about movement that is very good for allowing my brain to go into free flow. I’m quite good at having thoughts when I’m driving or cycling or walking. I think you go into this place when you do something very physical and your brain starts to put together interesting thoughts. I also get this when doing something mechanical with my work, like collage. The act of cutting out pieces of paper, the intricacy and the concentration combined, allows my brain to pick up on other thoughts.I often find myself staring out of the window. I think we assume that’s dead time, or an act of procrastination, when actually that time of just staring, when your brain goes into a slightly bored state, is quite important. In it, we start to notice things and put them together.But if I get really stuck, I’ve learned not to just sit with it. If I’m working on a novel or picture book and I get downhearted, I go and do something different. I might start on a new story, or revisit one I started a while back. Sometimes I’ll draw. Sometimes the movement of the hand releases something else that’s stuck in my mind.I like to try to find something that’s not on the internet. I go around lots of old bookshops. There are amazing charity shops in Walthamstow, east London that sell rare, limited editions. I like finding odd, obscure objects, so odd that when you type their name into the internet nothing comes up. The collection I currently have in shops was inspired by a really obscure book about upholstery and fabrics from the 60s that featured bold florals, sort of Americana: camper-van florals. More recently, a picture of an artist covered in oil got me thinking about using an oil effect on shoes and bags. I like collecting a physical thing that you can touch, and turning it into something new.Creativity is good in the morning. I take one hour for myself to just play around without any purpose or design in mind. I always carry a sketchbook with me, a pencil, some tape, a file with different-coloured paper, and things to collage with. Most of my work is based around graphic elements and colours, and I fill my sketchbooks with patterns and designs that I often refer back to. I love going for a coffee in that hour: I’ll spread out on the table, usually outside or it might be when I’m travelling, when there is more freedom to be playful.I love going to see other art forms, especially theatre, and I’m an obsessive reader, not just of books but everything – magazines, newspapers, Twitter. I also love listening to the radio. My mind has a strange habit of remembering all kinds of information that often seems completely pointless, yet sometimes it all comes together to form this clear concept from beginning to end and then it becomes a story that I feel has to be told. After that, all I have to do is convince everyone else to help me make it real. That’s usually the hardest part.I walk long distances. I walk to go through zones of the mind. I become empty and aware and I listen. I never know what I am listening for and then it comes, sometimes indirectly, sometimes as a stirring.Creativity is our normal and fundamental way of being. It is everything else – our education, our social conditioning, our cultural mores, our upbringing – that imprisons our creativity. If you don’t believe me, watch a child at play. To them all things are possible because they have not learned that some things are impossible. We don’t need to learn to be creative. We need to unlearn not being creative.I am always most creative in a quiet and peaceful environment, somewhere I can escape the overload of the senses that we are all subjected to now. For me, being in nature and in particular the British landscape, with no distraction, is my main source of inspiration. Also, I have three young children, so at the moment I find their naivety and wide-eyed view on the world refreshing and unexpected. I can find inspiration in my girls’ drawings, what they collect on a walk and what they notice. I find that the best ideas well up from the subconscious and knock on my “conscious” door. When I hear one knock for the third time, I know I must act. It happened like this with my series of photographs, Concorde. At the time it was in no way obvious that spending weeks around Heathrow and south London, looking out for the Concorde plane, would result in a strong work. But in the previous two years, the idea to do just that had popped into my mind on three or more occasions, without any outside cue. Listening to those ideas is important – to hear the faint voice of what you’re genuinely interested in, and filter out the loud noise of desire and vanity. • Commenting on this piece?

The South West Coast Path runs along the top of the cliff, but there’s also a lower path, the Hooken undercliff path. To reach it from Branscombe beach, you go up through the caravan park, and up what we call Heart Attack Hill to this beautiful little path that snakes along the cliff face. At one point, it drops down to a deserted part of the beach where only the locals go. This picture was taken towards the end of the undercliff path, looking back into the valley towards Branscombe beach.There are some sea stacks off the beach that you can climb up on to if you’re feeling adventurous. And in the cliff face, there’s a cave where some hippies used to hang out. The path up to it has been eroded, but if you haven’t got the dog, you can climb up on a rope through the foliage into the cave (that’s local knowledge: not for the grockles). It’s a little hairy so I’ve done it only once. It smelled of pee.I grew up in the suburbs and moved to the city – Glasgow – so until five years ago I had no experience of living in a rural location. We thought of Devon after seeing it on Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s River Cottage show: “Where’s that?” Being here changes you as a person, and it must have changed my work. I’ve built a little drawing board in the spare room, and do a lot of black-and-white drawings here. When we first moved in, I made the work for an exhibition in Copenhagen they wanted big drawings, so they were as big as would fit into that room – 127.5cm wide and 92.5cm high – all stored under the bed.If it’s a nice day, we’ll walk to Beer for a vegetarian pasty and loop back over the fields it takes about two hours. I ate meat for 47 years, until I started doing this walk. On the path to the beach I’d say hello to the cows and the calves, the sheep and the chickens, and I thought, “I can’t do this any more”, much to the disdain of the locals. One early morning, I saw eight dolphins off the beach – a special moment. And I’ve seen an adder or two they tend to be out in early summer, sunning themselves, but fortunately they’re very shy.Walking along the undercliff one day, I saw some alexanders growing. They’re a green vegetable, a bit like a tenderstem broccoli but with an aniseed flavour. I was served them once at a zero-waste restaurant in Brighton called Silo, but had never come across them anywhere else. I was just about to pick them when a dog peed on them. Maybe that accounts for the aniseed.Once, we were on the beach after the mackerel had chased all the little whitebait on to the sand, thousands of them flipping around. We brought home a carrier bag full and prepared them in a little flour and egg white and lemon juice. They were absolutely delicious nature’s bounty. Were it not for the dog pee, I’d have eaten them with alexanders.This summer I’ve been drawing a lot. I walk the dog, work a few hours, swim in the sea, work some more. There’s something meditative about being close to the water: it reminds me that I am a little electrochemical being that needs to be earthed somehow, and the sea lets me discharge whatever electrical currents are in my brain. There’s a certain contentment and peace about my work now, which is fine: I’ve done enough angst in my lifetime.A former  Weekend columnist, David Shrigley installed a seven-metre thumb on Trafalgar Square’s fourth plinth in 2016, and was shortlisted for the Turner prize in 2013. His satirical, often surreal work encompasses drawing, film, installation and performance his most recent book is Fully Coherent Plan: For A New And Better Society (£14.99, Canongate). A former marshland, this Thamesmead walk covers wild nature, urban developments – ranging from high-rises and artificial waterways to terraced streets and suburban cul-de-sacs – with pastoral landscape, all of it split by major roads. It’s an interesting time for this part of south-east London, as it awaits large-scale redevelopment, with thousands of new homes planned.A few years ago this landscape was the focus for an MA Architecture studio I was leading on at Central St Martins. Our brief was to come up with project ideas exploring proposals for new forms of enterprise. Our approach, as with Assemble, was first to look at what was already happening, then build on that and learn from local experts. We met with a priest, residents, business owners, developers we looked at the history as well as people’s ambitions for the future. Some students celebrated the beautiful and peculiar landscape, others found new potential for Thamesmead’s brutalist sky walks and empty garages. We encouraged an open-minded, unbiased, imaginative, playful approach.Starting at Abbey Wood station, you cross the road to see the ruins of the 12th-century Lesnes Abbey. It was built with stone from Normandy and the ancient monument sits in a nature reserve with adjacent woods and a cafe. Look out for the Green Man carved into a tree.Cross Abbey Road by the footbridge and wander past the adventure playground and through Southmere Park towards Southmere Lake. Just south of the lake, you can explore the 1960s, low-rise housing estate that was the dystopian setting for the Stanley Kubrick film A Clockwork Orange. The estate was part of an ambitious plan to clear the overcrowded Victorian terraces of inner London. Prepare to get lost in the warren of walkways on different levels, part of a vision to construct elevated streets for pedestrians. If you leave the lake at the north-eastern tip, turning off to Belvedere Road and walking east, you’ll reach Crossness pumping station. It’s open to the public on selected days, and on a guided tour you can see the splendour of this Victorian “cathedral of ironwork”. Built by Sir Joseph Bazalgette for London’s sewerage system in the 19th century, it’s been dubbed London’s Cistern Chapel. Keep your eyes peeled for the cast-iron laxative decorations! Next, head east to the Crossness nature reserve, until you hit the muddy Thames beach that looks across the river to a striking industrial landscape.If instead you leave the lake at the north-eastern corner, swing left across Eastern Way and into the field at Crossway Park to get on to the Crossway Lake canal and footbridges and paths to Manorway Green. Carry on walking until you get to the Thames. A wide expanse of river opens up views of the city’s industry. Turn right and carry on walking towards the Thamesmead Ecology Study Area. The landscape is beautifully wild with an expansive, veiny mud tide.Maria Lisogorskaya is a member of the architecture and art collective Assemble, which began in 2010. Its 16 to 20 members have backgrounds in design, anthropology and construction. Assemble won the 2015 Turner prize for their Liverpool community project, Granby Four Streets.I call this walk “the circuit”. It’s only a 10-minute drive from where my wife, Susan, and I live in Bristol, but it’s amazingly rural. The walk takes an hour and a half and the great thing about it is the variety of different landscapes – open meadow, woods, farmland and an amazing view of the city. Then you come down a rural road which has these imposing walls, and pass a church and a converted stately home. Often a walk takes you up and then back down and the view is different when you walk the other way but this takes you on an incredible circuit.We’ve been doing this walk every six weeks for 25 years now. Generally we go for a walk on a Sunday morning and I like to go to different places, but this walk has been accommodated into my general being. We’ll even walk it in the rain.I enjoy returning to the same place and noticing the differences, albeit predictable, because seasonally they come and go in the correct order, of course. I find it very reliable it’s stability in our changing world.It’s the reassurance of the seasons unfolding the wild garlic, the bluebells, the buttercups, the blackberries. Spring is so uplifting in March the wild garlic is a sight to behold, but May is the most emphatic, because everything is so green and lush and fresh. By June and July, it starts to wither somewhat. Other things change. As the result of a storm in 2012, we now have to climb over collapsed trees across the path. And when we pass through the field, it’s upsetting to see some of the bramble hedges – which were full of blackberries – have been stripped out to make the farm more efficient. We pick them there’s still enough to make a pie.This is our most regular walk, but I’ve never photographed it until now. If I do something for leisure it doesn’t mean I need to photograph it. When I’m shooting I walk miles. I haven’t got an app that tells me how long I’m walking for, but it’s a lot.I don’t regard myself as a “creative” person - I don’t like thinking about creativity in isolation. I just love being out there, discovering, and turning it into pictures. Whether that’s people or landscapes, it’s the same issue all you’re doing is trying to articulate your ideas into a photograph.Martin Parr is a documentary photographer known for his anthropological approach to postwar Britain and class. He opened The Martin Parr Foundation in Bristol in 2014, and is a member of Magnum Photos.I used to do this walk with my daughter Rose, after she was born 31 years ago. We’d start at the Chiswick High Road end of Duke’s Avenue. The trees that line this London street are a continuation of the avenue of trees in the gardens of Chiswick House. We would continue along the avenue until we came to the vast flower bed, a little way down and to the right. At one end of that is a slope, at the top of which stands a wonderful glass house of camellias, which were originally brought by boat from China in the 18th century. We’d go in there to see the famous collection of flowers and afterwards, once Rose could walk, she would always roll down the slope outside. We’d sometimes get a drink just in front of the house. Now, there’s a rather grand restaurant. Back then there was only a shack that sold soft drinks and a couple of Mars bars.In those days the house wasn’t open to the public, as it is now. We would peep in sometimes it was empty because they hadn’t decided what to do with it. Just in front there was, and still is, a cedar of Lebanon, planted in 1720 when William Kent designed the garden. We called it the climbing tree, and Rose would always want to clamber on to it. Then we would go through a little iron gate to say good morning to the goldfish in their tiny round pond. After that we’d feed the ducks on the big lake, and walk over the bridge towards the wild woodland part of the gardens, where the squirrels would come right up to you. Rose had particular favourites and gave them names. Then we’d pass the small pond with the Greek temple and sit opposite for a while with the squirrels. Eventually we’d walk back out and up Duke’s Avenue.This watercolour took me about a week to do, combining a couple of photographs that my wife, Chrissy, took recently of the tree, with an earlier picture of Rose. I used a graphic design, rather than a painting technique: scanning the photographs to the size I wanted and then tracing them, so I had a basic drawing ready and could work into it with paint.Watercolour is a difficult medium but incredibly satisfying when you get it right. The secret is to keep the paper as the white in the picture so if you’re painting a face, and there’s a highlight somewhere, you try to paint all around it, keeping the white paper. There are different stages. I painted the sky first as a flat blue, then the branches against it. Then I added a thin blue glaze and painted up to it. You can wet the paper and put watercolour on, but it doesn’t dry the way it first goes on it does stuff with the water. It’s magical.Once I’m working from a photograph, any information comes from that. I remember the walk and I remember the tree, so there’s no need for me to go and see it. I’m 86 and lucky I’ve got a long-term memory. Once I decided this was the walk I wanted to paint, I just sat and recreated it in my mind and slowly it all came about.I hadn’t been back in recent years until last month, when Chrissy and I did that same walk to see Giffords Circus – only I’m in a wheelchair now. So there was a strange poignancy to be retracing our steps but with me, as it were, in the pram now.Peter Blake  is best known for his work using collage and advertising imagery, and exhibited alongside David Hockney in the early 1960s. Co-creator of the Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover in 1967, he was dubbed the “godfather” of British pop art. He was knighted in 2002, and has lived in Chiswick, west London, since 1967. His exhibition, Peter Blake: A Life in Drawings and Watercolours, runs until 8 September at Waddington Custot, London.I’ve lived at my house in Preston for 30 years. My home studio overlooks Avenham Park, which I usually walk through every day – before I start work early on summer mornings, at around 5.30am, or to see friends across town, or to take visiting artists to the Continental pub for drinks and dinner. The walk is both the aperitif and the space in which the business gets done.The 10-minute route to the pub is different every time I do it. There are seasonal changes, of course, but even if I go twice in one day, the River Ribble will be different. Sometimes the tide is really high and the water is rushing around from the Lake District, bringing all sorts of stuff with it. I’ve seen a dead cow on that river, and I don’t think I’ll ever get the image out of my head. On other days, it’s idyllic and there are swans floating along in a very Victorian way.At the steps into the park, there are cannons that look out across the river to the hills beyond the town, as if they’re defending Preston against marauding hordes, which makes me laugh. Sometimes I half cross the bridge to watch the river, but mostly I walk along it, past the Pavilion cafe. There used to be a tacky old bandstand there every Sunday, there would be brass bands playing and little old ladies would sit down with their sandwiches, and it was really nice. But obviously it wasn’t quite swish enough for Preston, so they knocked it down and built this really beautiful wooden pavilion. It has changed the whole nature of the park they do great meals and cake.After that comes the huge railway bridge, which has wonderful echoes as you walk under it. The path leads in to Miller Park with its statue of Lord Derby and strange grotto. On a good day, there’s a fake waterfall that seems to fall from the railway track into a pool below. It’s bizarre.Just before arriving at the Continental you get to the railway track out of town. It’s an important point for me, because I’m always going out of Preston and then coming back, either to install shows, or to go to London or the airport. I kind of like leaving Preston because it’s a small place and there isn’t much to do – but I’m always incredibly happy to come home. I love working with the other artists who live in and around the city, and who also exhibit internationally.The walk epitomises what many people don’t know about the city. It’s beautiful in a funny way, and perhaps too attached to its Victorian heritage a contemporary poverty mixes uneasily with the architectural wealth of the past. I am very attached to several cities, including London, Amsterdam and Venice but Preston nestles comfortably in that group.Lubaina Himid was a key member of the UK’s Black Arts Movement in the 1980s, and won last year’s Turner prize. • Commenting on this piece?

In a bid to highlight the realities of breastfeeding, celebrity mothers are sharing their breast pump photos online, and experts claim they are helping to fuel a rise in women expressing milk.As mothers attempt to reconcile the pressures of work with the often relentless demands of breastfeeding and childcare, they are trying in growing numbers to pump milk. Last week, Goldman Sachs became perhaps the first firm in the UK to pay for breastmilk to be couriered home if female staff are away on business.Alison Spiro, an adviser for the Institute of Health Visiting, said more mothers were attempting to pump milk in a bid to spread childcare more equitably.“We are seeing dads much more involved in childcare, and manufacturers have focused advertising on the fact that fathers can feed their babies breastmilk.”Anna Burbidge, from breastfeeding support group La Leche League GB, said her organisation had noticed an increase in mothers talking about expressing.“The increase in assisted conception, along with mothers giving birth prematurely, having multiple births and becoming mothers later in life, can sometimes lead to challenges with lactation,” she said.Another major explanation for the rise is work commitments. “For many who are in employment, this is the only way they can combine breastfeeding with their jobs,” said Caroline Gatrell, lecturer in work and family at the University of Liverpool, who pointed out that it is not always a straightforward option.“It involves collecting milk into sterilised containers, which is time-consuming and may be noisy, and it must be refrigerated and taken home in a cool bag. It can also be difficult at work because mothers must pump at regular intervals.”Cost can also be a deterrent. “The equipment is very expensive. It’s over £100 to buy an electric pump,” said Spiro. According to Katherine Twamley from the department of social sciences at University College London, an increasing number of parents opt to pump because they want to share the feeding process with their partner, but cuts to local breastfeeding support services means that people lack the correct advice. “My research shows there are increased aspirations to share feeding via pumping, but most are unable to successfully manage this. Like breastfeeding, mixed feeding needs peer or family support,” she said.For some women, pumping enables them to prolong breastfeeding, involve others in the feeding process and enjoy the odd night out. “It gives me freedom to work and not be the only one feeding my son,” said Sarah Wallace, who has a 10-month-old.Others, however, say they were left with no choice but to express if they wanted to give their baby breast milk. Dance instructor Beccie Savage, 43, was advised at hospital to express for her son as he was underweight and had trouble feeding. He ended up preferring the bottle and rejecting the breast so she exclusively pumped for six months. Although it enabled her to go back to work part-time six weeks after the birth, she said it was not as easy as the celebrity selfies suggest.“It’s really hard having to sterilise all the time, and doing it every two to three hours is painful,” she said. “I don’t regret it but there wasn’t enough support for me at the beginning.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

It’s not just about you: going back will affect everyone in the family, and they’ll need to do more. Delegate, organise and schedule – be clear about who needs to do what and when. Not just the cooking but the being in for the plumber, the washing, the first point of call for school if you’re unable to answer the phone.If you want to change direction, be realistic. Think about how your next position could be a step on the way to your ideal job. If you’ve been an accountant, say, then a move into branding with a charity is going to be a stretch. Your first move might need to be into finance in the charitable sector.Maximise your social networks. Make friends with LinkedIn: it’s where all the jobs are. Follow the people who are hiring – it might feel like stalking, but it’s not. Get your profile updated and ask ex-colleagues for recommendations. On Facebook, look for groups where you know people will be posting the sort of opportunities you’re looking for follow the organisations that are hiring people like you. Same with Twitter. Dedicate at least an hour a day to this. And double-check all your online profiles.Mothers want flexibility but there’s not a lot on offer. The flexible-working site Timewise found that fewer than one in 10 quality jobs (ie paying over £20k a year) is advertised as flexible. Don’t apply only for those jobs. Focus on what you have to offer. If you’re confident you can deliver the job in a way that suits you and the employer, be prepared to negotiate. Start the conversation with what you can do, not what your limitations are (no one wants to hear about your complex childcare arrangements).• She’s Back: Your Guide To Returning To Work by Lisa Unwin and Deb Khan (Urbane Publications, £9.99).

From the stunning coastlines of Crete, to the lively festivals of Thessaloniki and the sacred sites of Delphi, the country combines beautiful landscapes with rich mythology and literature. Go on a sunset wine tour beside the bright-blue seas and domes of Santorini, believed to have been the home of the mythical land of Atlantis. Or visit Delos, where Apollo, the god of poetry, truth and prophecy, is said to have been born. Travel to one of the world’s largest natural harbours in Ithaca and you’ll see why Odysseus is intent on returning here in Homer’s Odyssey. Literature is inescapable in Greece. Athens offers its own tour of the spots where writers from all over the world once spent their time keen cyclists can take a three-hour bike tour around historic Athens and Plaka. Families with teens can be led around the city by a street-art expert, exploring the graffiti and urban art of a thriving creative scene. And if it’s great food you’re after, why limit yourself to eating when you can learn how to make it too? Join one of the city’s cooking lessons designed to give tourists a chance to recreate seven traditional Greek dishes, before heading home with a recipe book.If you’re in the market for a lazy holiday of sun, sand and sea, Crete could be the place for you. With its secluded bays and pink-sand beaches, Greece’s largest island is stunning and hospitable. Elounda is perhaps the fanciest part – a good spot if you’ve got a bit of cash to spend, or for the honeymooners. Alternatively, you could take the heart-stopping drive through narrow roads on steep cliffs to Stefanou Beach, an incredible cove of turquoise water. Elafonisi Beach is the place for pastel-pink sand. It is near a national park where tourists are known to come and do a five-hour hike through the gorge. Nature lovers might also enjoy Pátmos, designated as the “Holy Island” of Greece. Its settlement, Chorá, is a world heritage site, where white houses sparkle under the Aegean sun between historical streets leading from the island’s port, Skála, to the famous monastery. This is where John the Apostle wrote the Book of Revelation, having been banished to Pátmos by the Roman authorities. Ultimately, Greece’s extraordinary literary legacy is evident almost everywhere you look. Whether you’re exploring the inner cities or taking time out on the beach, a holiday in Greece is a great chance to familiarise yourself with the abundance of literature written about this ancient, mythical and beautiful country. And you might want to start with any number of the audiobooks listed below, perfect for listeners heading there this summer.The Magus by John Fowles, NaxosNicholas Urfe is a young Brit teaching English on a fictional Greek island, based on Spetses. Bored and consumed by his loneliness, he stumbles on to a wealthy estate and its Greek owner, Maurice Conchis, a man who may have collaborated with the Nazis. The two develop a friendship, and Nicholas is drawn into Conchis’s mysterious ways and psychological games, becoming a performer in re-enactments of the Nazi occupation and obscene parodies of Greek mythology. This is a chilling thriller, as well as a postmodern classic, in which the narrator, Nicholas, grows unsure of what is real. Many of its settings exist, however. The Lord Byron School, where Nicholas teaches, is the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses, and Villa Bourani is a private house on the south side of the island, overlooking a popular public beach.The Names by Don DeLillo, MacmillanDeLillo knows how to write a dense and elusive novel. And he doesn’t miss the mark in this tale about the mythological world. The characters are bizarre, yet well realised, and the author uses their story to look at family loss and language. It’s classic DeLillo, in so far as all the players are smart and eloquent, including the children, and it is stylish throughout – much more than just your average exotic thriller. Set in Athens, this is a story that moves away from conventional plot to focus on politics, culture, religion and mythology.Murder in Mykonos by Jeffrey Siger, HachetteWhen a backpacker goes missing on the island of Mykonos, no one is sure if it is her body that is found in the ancient church. Andreas Kaldis, the new chief of police, recently arrived from Athens, is faced with an island of locals who are used to doing things their own way. The case reminds him, and veteran homicide investigator Tassos Stamatos, of the ritualistic murders of a few years ago, but the suspect has since killed himself. So who could the killer be? The book reveals its author’s intimate knowledge of Mykonos, with very visual descriptions and lots of information about the historic churches. Perhaps it’s no surprise this was a bestseller in Greece.Exit West by Mohsin Hamid, PenguinIn the newest novel by the author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist and How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, Hamid tells a story about migration, in which the refugee journey happens through a portal. While living in an unnamed country taken over by war, Nadia and Saeed hear of “doors that could take you elsewhere, often to places far away”. The couple pass through a portal and find that they are on the Greek island of Mykonos, in a refugee camp. Here, “everyone was foreign, and so, in a sense, no one was”. Exit West is a timely tale about the global refugee crisis, much of which Greece has witnessed first hand. This modern history of the country is just as compelling as its mythology.Captain Corelli’s Mandolin by Louis de Bernières, AudibleSet on the Greek island of Kefalonia, the novel follows Antonio Corelli, an Italian army captain who comes to the island in the early days of the second world war. Corelli begins a love affair with Pelagia, the daughter of local doctor Iannis. Their relationship is complicated, as is to be expected in wartime, and atrocities mount around them, in both their personal lives and the life of the island itself. This is a love story and a war story – a tale of an island that is occupied first by the Italians, then the Germans. The characters are gloriously rendered and Captain Corelli’s Mandolin uses its magical setting to tell a now-famous story about romance and courage.Shirley Valentine by Willy Russell, Laughing StockYou’ve probably seen the film, adapted from the play of the same name. Shirley is a lonely middle-aged Liverpudlian woman in a loveless marriage. When her friend offers to take her on holiday to Greece, she packs her bags and heads for the sun. The gorgeous island of Mykonos is a strong attraction for both tourists and, seemingly, many of the writers who go there. And it’s the same for Shirley, who rediscovers herself here, along with the happiness she’s been longing for. Hers is a story of finding self-confidence, and recognising it’s never too late to start again.Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis, Recorded BooksMaybe you’ve seen the film too? Written by Cretan Kazantzakis, the novel tells the story of a Greek intellectual who befriends working man Alexis Zorba. Zorba is a larger than life and unpredictable, unlike the narrator, who is modest and reserved. The two become friends, and the passion in Zorba’s character reminds both narrator and reader of the joys of living. Set in Crete, the tale captures the island’s passionate spirit – full of its smells, tastes and wines.The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller, IsisThis is The Iliad skilfully told from another perspective. Writing from the point of view of Achilles’s best friend, Patroclus, Madeline Miller convincingly reimagines the relationship as a romance, casting a different light on the Trojan War. Achilles is given a human touch. He is gentle and capable of love. It’s a new side to an ancient story and it’s super smart. The men are not positioned as brothers in arms, but as the soul mates that Homer hints they might be. Greece’s wealth of mythological and classical literature is complemented by this masterful modern interpretation.My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell, AudibleThis autobiographical work tells the story of British zookeeper, conservationist and TV presenter Gerald Durrell’s childhood on the Greek island of Corfu, where he discovered his interest in the natural world. Home-schooled during this period, Durrell became friends with a Greek doctor, Theodore Stephanides, who acted as a mentor to the boy and kindled his fascination with local fauna. The book is as much about the author’s family experiences as it is about Corfu. “It was originally intended to be a mildly nostalgic account of the natural history of the island,” wrote Durrell, “but I made a grave mistake by introducing my family into the book in the first few pages.” My Family and Other Animals is as charming as it is full of sunny olive groves and cypress trees, and all the more enjoyable for it.Mythos by Stephen Fry, PenguinAncient Greek literature has inspired creators from Shakespeare to Walt Disney. The Greek myths are told to you here by the ever-soothing voice of Stephen Fry, who takes you from Zeus to Athena with his typical humour. The Greek gods of the past become relatable, as pop culture, modern literature and music are woven into their stories. It is joyfully informal, yet full of the literary legacy threaded through so much of the tapestry of contemporary Greece.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

Other major holdings include a £43m stake in Google parent company Alphabet, £35m of shares in Facebook, a £24m stake in Apple and £23m of investment in Netflix.The tech companies are posing an existential challenge for the BBC, whose audiences are migrating to new platforms. On Thursday, the BBC’s director general, Tony Hall, warned an audience in Sweden that “new global players” have created “huge super-inflation” in the price for new programmes. Later the same day, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, proposed a tax on tech giants such as Facebook, Google and Netflix to help subsidise the BBC’s continued operation.But the figures show that the surging share price of these major tech companies is good news for the 50,000 beneficiaries of the BBC’s pension fund. BBC workers have not been able to join the scheme since 2010, meaning that while employees are dealing with challenges from the likes of Netflix, older and former colleagues are benefiting from the financial success of these media rivals.Funding the generous defined benefit pension scheme is a substantial drain on BBC resources. The pension fund received £156m from the BBC during the last year – equivalent to about £6 from every licence fee.The BBC said the stock holdings remain a relatively small part of the overall fund, which manages more than £16bn in assets across a range of investments. The scheme is run independently of the corporation by trustees who set investment priorities in consultation with the BBC and financial advisers, although four trustees are appointed by the BBC and another four are elected by members.The fund has a £1.8bn shortfall, and a long-term deficit reduction programme is being funded from the BBC’s income at a time when the broadcaster is having to make cuts in other parts of the organisation. Other substantial holdings include £40m in Chinese internet giant Tencent and £27m in Elon Musk’s Tesla."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caf9c6c6391474eab89d48af73e4b6575c7a7639/0_242_7242_4347/master/7242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77f72e81248f59706bf87d0d3f806a6d","title":"lets move to callander and the trossachs","story":"It looks like Disney bought up the place and squished the whole of Scotland into a few square milesWhat’s going for it? “The Highlands in miniature”, they call it, and, true enough, the Trossachs (great name, by the way), do look as if Disney had come along, bought up the place and squished the whole of Scotland into a few square miles.

Yet converting offices into tiny living spaces doesn’t even need planning permissionShockingly small flats that apparently measure as little as 3.6 metres by 3.6 metres (12ft x 12ft), residents packed in “like sardines”, a busy six-lane highway just yards away, broken glass and rubbish strewn all around outside ... is Newbury House in east London the 21st century version of a Dickensian slum? Or is this simply the harsh reality when you live on a small island that’s desperately short of housing?Across the country, office buildings are being converted into “apartments” that are in some cases smaller than the size of a typical bedroom, and fall far short of national space standards. These office-to-residential conversions are controversial because they don’t require planning permission – and there’s growing concern in some quarters about poor-quality accommodation, overcrowding and a lack of usable outdoor space.Now a leading architect who is one of the London mayor’s “design advocates” has named and shamed what she claims is “one of the worst examples” she has ever encountered: a tatty-looking seven-storey former office block next to the A12 in Ilford, east London, which has been converted into rental flats.Land Registry records show that Newbury House is owned by a company based 4,000 miles away in the British Virgin Islands, which could well be pocketing several hundred thousand pounds in rent a year – not bad for a property it bought for £1.4m five years ago.In a comment article for a building design website, Julia Park said Newbury House represents “a new low” in office-to-residential conversions and that “no one should have to live like this”. However, she adds that this is by no means an isolated case. She has written to the communities secretary, the housing minister and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, expressing her concern.The conversion appears to have gone ahead as planned, which means each of the six upper floors is now made up of 10 self-contained studio flats. So that’s 60 flats. The architect’s drawings describe 18 of the studios as “singles” and 42 as “doubles”.According to the plans, the smallest singles are just 13 sq metres – that’s a room just a fraction bigger than 3.6 metres by 3.6 metres – while the smallest doubles are 14.7 sq metres. Yet the government’s own space standard – known as the “nationally described space standard” – states that the minimum floor area for a new one-bedroom one-person home (including conversions) is 37 sq metres, and for a one-bed two person home it is 50 sq metres. While these minimum sizes are not compulsory, they do apply in London, but only to schemes that go through the planning system.Park, who is head of housing research at architects Levitt Bernstein, stumbled on Newbury House while in the area for a site visit on a blazingly hot day earlier this month. There were curtains drawn across many of the open windows, and she could hear voices from inside, including those of children.It is understood Redbridge council has been using Newbury House for temporary accommodation since December 2017. The council uses it to house single people while they wait to get a social housing place, and also young people leaving care.She adds: “I do not know who lives here but I am concerned that some may be vulnerable people on low incomes. I say this because it is inconceivable that living in these conditions could be a positive choice for anyone.” Money paid a visit to Newbury House this week. It is right next to the A12, with all the pollution and traffic noise that that entails. We were told we couldn’t come into the building to knock on residents’ doors, and shortly after that we were notified that we would have to leave or the police would be called.The building looked very shabby, and the small area of outdoor space was strewn with rubbish including large amounts of broken glass. Looking up at the flats, we could see windows propped open with fizzy drink bottles and wooden cooking spoons, and hear music playing. We managed to give our phone number to one of the residents before being told to leave, and he later called to tell us about life in Newbury House.The man, who did not wish to give his name, told us he had been housed there by the council. He said the residents were “packed in like sardines”, and added that many of the people living there had “issues”. He said there were 10 flats on his floor, and six floors of accommodation.Asked about his flat, he said: “It’s very small – very substandard to what the government requires.” He added that there was no ventilation.The man also said the building had become a “crime magnet,” with fighting and drugs, and added: “I’m just worried someone is going to be killed.”His account was backed up by a notice pinned to the wall of the foyer that was spotted by Money which said there had been complaints of antisocial behaviour including drug-dealing and “weed smoking”.Documents relating to the building conversion state that the developer was Dorchester Estates, which describes itself as a “boutique real estate company” with branches in London and the Middle East. However, Dorchester Estates told us it was the managing agent. A Land Registry search found that the building’s registered owner is a British Virgin Islands company called Newbury House Ltd, which gives its address as Trident Chambers, contactable via a post office box number in the islands’ capital, Road Town.During the past few years there has been a frenzy of office-to-residential conversion activity in some areas. This boom is largely down to the fact that in 2013 the government relaxed the rules to allow office buildings to be turned into housing without the need to go through the planning process. These so-called “permitted development” conversions are also not required to meet space standards.One resident of a former office in Croydon told the researchers: “I’m speechless. How can this be allowed in a civilised country? It’s so wrong. The politicians who allowed this need to come and live here. It’s a total nightmare.”The Rics report added that all the indications were that the conversions were “highly profitable” for developers. So how much money is Newbury House’s owner making from those living there? That’s hard to say. But it could potentially be several hundred thousand pounds. Let’s say there were 60 people living there, each entitled to the local housing allowance (the name given to housing benefit for private tenants) for a one-bedroom home in that postcode, which adds up to £8,332 a year, or £4,024 for those under 35 living on their own. LHA helps cover the cost of rent and is usually paid to the inidual, but a council will sometimes make the payment direct to the landlord.Even 60 lots of the lower figure, with nothing added on top, would add up to £241,000 a year.Redbridge council told us it had a “comparatively small” social housing stock, and that people could wait a long time for a home to become available. “Like much of London, we also have high levels of arising homelessness, and we need to find good-quality and affordable solutions as temporary accommodation and private sector options to meet that need. Newbury House is part of that provision for single homeless households.” It said the government “needs to do more to help us realise our ambitions”.Sheffield is home to the UK’s smallest houses, while Cambridge’s are the biggest.That is the headline finding of a new survey which will add to the debate on so-called “shoebox” homes. However, there may be caveats attached.The research by LABC Warranty, which provides warranties for new-build homes, used data from property websites Rightmove and Zoopla to analyse house sizes within a five-mile radius of 20 UK cities.It said that in Sheffield, the average floor space of a privately owned home was 61.2 sq metres.The researchers collected data including the size of the living room, kitchen, master bedroom and bathroom, as well as determining the average number of bedrooms and whether the property had access to a garden. However, it appears the analysis did not include certain areas, such as a hallway or staircase, which means it may underestimate the true picture.The three cities with the next-smallest average house sizes were Southampton (64.9 sq metres), Bristol (65 sq metres) and Glasgow (65.2 sq metres). Meanwhile, the figures for London, Manchester and Birmingham were 65.7 sq metres, 67.2 sq metres and 69.9 sq metres respectively.The two cities with the largest typical house sizes were Cambridge (71.8 sq metres) and its academic rival Oxford (70.7 sq metres).Earlier research claimed that Britain’s new-build homes were already the smallest in Europe.And in 2015, research from the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) showed that more than half of the new homes under construction were too small to meet the needs of those who buy them. It found that homes in Yorkshire were the smallest in England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96f3479f8551765a9e5f1d0de3ef7fb8d046eead/0_302_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdef139e858388a67a93a00b6d822acc","title":"uk sport funding compete paralympic level boccia","story":"Jamie McCowan uses his allowance on equipment and training for the ball sport bocciaI started playing the ball game boccia after going to the Ayrshire Special Games when I was nine and had just started using a wheelchair. I didn’t think Paralympic sport was an option at the time, but the Scottish coach saw I had potential.My brother, Scott (also a Paralympian), and I have Duchenne muscular dystrophy and both play boccia, a target sport with the aim of getting more of your coloured balls closer to a white ball, the jack, than your opponent. It’s similar to bowls and pétanque, but there’s no Olympic equivalent – it’s only in the\u0026nbspParalympics.Scott and I live with our parents and have our dad and other staff as carers. We started off representing Scotland, then got into the Great Britain squad, and Scott competed in the London Paralympics. We also competed in the Rio Paralympics.Our category in boccia is called BC3, which means we have to use a ramp to propel the balls and have\u0026nbspan assistant to get the ball down the ramp – mum and dad are our\u0026nbspassistants.The boccia programme for this Paralympic cycle, and the buildup to Tokyo 2020, receives about £3.7m from UK Sport. As part of this, I have an athlete performance award for sporting costs of £1,250 a month, or £15,000 a year.The award varies depending on what level the athlete is at the more success you have, the higher up the levels you can go. Our level of funding is deemed “podium potential”, which means we have the potential to win medals at world championships and the Paralympics, but haven’t done so yet. Its purpose is to support athletes to train with less financial worries. I spend my award on equipment. A set of 13 boccia balls costs between £300 and £700. After the Rio Paralympics we made tactical changes that required new sets of balls. There’s other equipment, too, such as the ramp and a helmet with a pointer on the end to release the ball. We had to get new head pointers, which cost about £100 each time.We also spend money on a van to transport our wheelchairs and equipment, taxis, as I can’t drive due to my condition, and a sports hall to train in. Sometimes we need to take a taxi to a venue 30 or 40 miles away, which adds up to a couple of hundred pounds. Other costs include airport parking, food at competitions and supplements.The funding also pays for our physical-conditioning equipment. We use the money to improve our neck control and for the use of head pointers through a neck resistance harness, which costs £100-£150.Like any sport, it’s about those small percentages in performance and the money has contributed to us being one of the fittest squads. When I was more able, the funding also paid for gym membership, but now I use it to access hydro pools and strength programmes that help me play at an elite level.Part of the funding agreement is that we have to make a number of appearances at schools and sports clubs. It’s great to show others what disabled people are able to do and to inspire them.Away from the sport, Scott and I like going to gigs – we go to four or five a year. I spend a lot of money on music – my favourite album is Hotel California by the Eagles, it’s perfect. We like football, too, and support Celtic and watch them play.Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a deteriorating condition so it’s great to travel round the world and play sport at such a high level. Sport has changed my life for the better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9589d8788f02bca84703864dc3812dbb52e4dbd0/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d5045a41f7d9240dd488899a2375021","title":"dirty laundry bleached bumholes and reading uni the secrets behind ed sheerans success","story":"On the eve of a new documentary, what can we learn about the man behind the music?Like Brexit, Dr Alex off Love Island and suffocating dread, Ed Sheeran is bloody everywhere. Not only is his current album ÷ (AKA Divide, released in March 2017) still in the upper reaches of the chart, but his songwriting-for-hire sideline doesn’t show any signs of stopping. After writing hits for the likes of Justin Bieber, 1D and Rita Ora, he has recently co-penned Eastside by Benny Blanco, Summer On You for US boyband PrettyMuch, and Because, the sonic equivalent of a damp flannel, for the thankfully departing Boyzone. Meanwhile, 2002, his co-write with Anne-Marie, is still pinging around the UK Top 40 more than four months after its release.Later this week, lucky Apple Music users will be able to watch Songwriter, an “intimate” (ie it was filmed by his cousin) documentary that, as the name implies, will focus on the Galway Girl creator’s increasingly influential penmanship. In fact, the trailer teases an extended section focused solely on the creation of that ill-judged update on B*Witched’s C’est La Vie, with Sheeran teasing out the song’s chorus wearing a Hooters T-shirt. At one point, high on the fumes of creativity, he gestures to someone off screen and utters the words no one wants to hear: “Could you just get on the fiddle?”Given his ubiquity, here’s a five-step guide to knowing when you’re listening to an Ed Sheeran composition …When Ed Sheeran was six, he broke his leg. At 15 he was smoking hand-rolled cigarettes. He first kissed a girl on a Friday and doesn’t reckon he “did it right”. We know all this because he details it so poetically on his rose-tinted paean to Suffolk, Castle on the Hill. Sheeran’s love of the not-so-distant-past isn’t solely confined to his own songs, however. In 2014, he penned 18 for One Direction, a song that saw the then-20-year-olds looking back to a time two years prior, while 2012’s Moments had Zayn remembering: “Flashing lights in my mind, going back to the time Playing games in the street, kicking balls at my feet.” Eastside, meanwhile, opens with the wistful “When I was young, I fell in love,” before everyday life arrives to mess it all up: “Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family A house and everything in between And then, oh, suddenly we turned 23 Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously.” The nostalgia payload, however, was saved for Anne-Marie’s 2002 (“Paint a picture for you and me Of the days when we were young”), which focuses on a trip to the woods when she was 11 and features a chorus made up of lyrics from four “old” songs, one of which was released two years after the titular time slot.Newsflash: Ed Sheeran is rich. If you have seen a picture of Ed Sheeran, however, you’ll know he doesn’t like to flaunt his wealth, choosing to style himself as not just “boy next door”, but “boy next door’s younger brother who works three days a week at Game and whose hoodie smells of Corn Flakes and wanking”. Divide’s What Do I Know? paints Sheeran as “just a boy with a one-man show No university, no degree,” which is odd because his whole vibe is very second-year-at-Reading-Uni. This skint vibe is kept up in his songwriting Shape of You describes some sort of trip to a buffet (“You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat”), while Liam Payne’s Strip That Down (“One Coke and Bacardi, (sippin’ lightly)”) and PrettyMuch’s Summer on You (“We’ll drink beer like it’s champagne (champagne)”) aren’t exactly anthems for excess. The frugal facade reaches its apex on the Sheeran co-penned Your Song by Rita Ora: “And then we make love right there on your best friend’s couch.” Not even a Novotel, Ed? Come on.Generic trop-bop Shape of You was originally written with Rihanna in mind, a woman who once cooed the line “with the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets” on California King Bed. Perhaps that’s what made Sheeran think she would be right for Shape of You, considering the song’s jolting moment is the similarly TMI: “and now my bed sheets smell like you,” a line that conjures up images of Sheeran’s ginger chin bristles tickling the lyocellcotton blend as he inhales another person’s musk. 1D’s Moments also continues a laundry list of lyrical laundry lists, focusing on some tardiness vis-a-vis the washing: “There’s a pile of my clothes at the end of your bed as I feel myself fall.”Sheeran is now engaged to his childhood sweetheart but will that stop his songwriting strand of painting women as villains? Justin Bieber’s Love Yourself, which Sheeran originally wrote for Divide, is smothered in bitterness from the patronising “Oh girl for goodness sake” line, to the faux life advice of the chorus, to the itchy chin emoji of “And I didn’t wanna write a song, ’cos I didn’t want anyone thinking I still care, I don’t.” Perhaps Sheeran assumed Divide already had its bitterness anthem in the shape of New Man, which snarkily pokes fun at an ex’s new boyfriend for renting a house and bleaching his bumhole, while also saving some sneering for the lady herself who has dared to move from eating crisps to eating kale. While One Direction’s Little Things plays at empowerment, it is actually a checklist of women’s flaws, some of which the band refused to sing live as their career unfolded, specifically the truly awful “You still have to squeeze into your jeans, but you’re perfect to me.”In an interview with notoriously candid hip-hop radio show The Breakfast Club, Sheeran shared, well, he shared a lot. As well as letting us know he wouldn’t have sex with Taylor Swift (“Too tall”), and that he thinks ine intervention helped his sex life (“I think God looked down at some point and said: ‘You need some help getting laid. Here is a guitar. Go forth, my son.’”), he also shared that while he does enjoy giving oral sex, he doesn’t “do the sucking the farts out”, which is good to know. He applies this awkwardness around sex to his songwriting, asking “Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?” on Thinking Out Loud, sharing that he’d like to be “between the sheets till the late AM” in Don’t and offering the most teenage-sounding description of a kiss ever in Sing: “One thing led to another, now she’s kissin’ my mouth.” It makes sense that he’d co-create Liam Payne’s Strip That Down, a song about drinking, dancing and snogging that’s about as sexy as a trip to the Fatberg exhibition.Songwriter is on Apple Music from Tuesday 28 August"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96b752ecc5253de516e53d2342a03a1fca3a2c5d/212_467_5061_3036/master/5061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef66380c6615f376419c697817e6fa95","title":"hers one to watch invitation to hers liverpool duo","story":"The Liverpool duo lovingly channel the 1980s, complete with drum machine, nods to Twin Peaks – and a special touring guestWith Tracey Thorn gone dance-pop and Morrissey gone wrong, where can bedsit-indie hearts go to pine these days?

And I wrapped a whole tissue roll around my underwear, just to keep my underwear dry until I got home. I once Sellotaped tissue to my underwear. I didn’t know what else to do.”This was the quote, from a schoolgirl in Leeds, that stunned me into realising that young women in the UK were experiencing the trauma of period poverty. All women have faced the mess of an unexpectedly early period, but the idea that, for some, this was the bloody reality of every day of every period was profoundly upsetting and galvanising.I began donating period products to my local food bank and then, keen to have a greater impact, I became involved as a volunteer coordinator for the Red Box Project, whose aim is to ensure that no young woman goes without access to menstrual protection. The project uses donations from local communities to provide red boxes filled with period products and spare underwear to more than 750 schools across the UK and, before the holidays, this number was increasing by more than 100 each month.And poverty is just one issue that may affect a person’s access to period products. There are myriad social and cultural reasons why products might not be available at home, many of which are linked with the stifling stigma that persists around menstruation. At the Red Box Project, we don’t ask why people need to use our boxes we believe everyone deserves equal access to period products, whatever their situation.In Scotland, vital steps are being taken to address these issues. In addition to its current pilot scheme to offer access to free period products to low-income families, the Scottish government announced last week it was becoming the first national government ever to provide free access to products in all schools, colleges and universities.Progress is also being made in Wales, where the government allocated £1m earlier this year to address period poverty in communities and improve facilities in schools.In England, we are being left behind. Yes, £1.5m from the “tampon tax fund” was pledged to the Brook project to address period poverty in England. But I cannot celebrate an allocation of pre-committed funds (raised from the injustice of VAT on menstrual products) to enable a charity simply to carry out its work. The government has said that period poverty is an issue for schools to tackle themselves, but at most schools I have visited to deliver red boxes, I have met staff who have been buying pupils period products with their own money. The responsibility to ensure that everyone can participate in their education lies with the government, not inidual schools or teachers. The right to an education is a fundamental human right, which should be unencumbered by biology.Almost 40 years have passed since Gloria Steinem contemplated what the world would look like if men menstruated. I’m willing to bet we wouldn’t be having this conversation if they did. Because period poverty is not simply another facet of poverty: it is a reflection of a society ridden with gendered inequalities. And it is an insidious issue. It disenfranchises and disempowers, affecting access to education and to opportunity. So I call for our government to fund free, universal access to menstrual products, in schools and in our wider communities. Because, as it stands, its inaction on period poverty is a bloody disgrace.Gemma Abbott is a volunteer coordinator for the Red Box project, a community-led initiative that aims to ensure that no young woman misses their education because of their period "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22cc90331bc3dd3d69512d5aa9a70e80ef3ea246/9_528_2902_1740/master/2902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ff4cfd76b31639b44b49479e72dd66","title":"andy murray us open not realistic to win this year","story":"Flushing Meadows holds glorious memories for the Scot but, at 378 in the world as he grinds his way back from hip surgery, he believes this year’s title is out of reachSerena Williams sent a tremor of concern through the US Open when she pulled out of a press conference days before her opening match on Monday against the unseeded Pole Magda Linette, advising organisers she felt “under the weather” – but at least Andy Murray is still in the draw.Outside the seedings at a major for the first time in 12 years and ranked 378 in the world as he grinds his way back from hip surgery, Murray does not think he can win the tournament where he made his breakthrough six years ago. His opponent on Monday is the Australian James Duckworth, who is 67 places below him in the rankings.Almost a year to the day after pulling out of last year’s Open Murray said on Friday: “This one feels slightly different because, for the last 10, 11 years, I have been preparing to try and win the event. I don’t think that is realistic for me this year.”Williams, who surprised everyone but herself by reaching the Wimbledon final this summer in only her second grand slam tournament since a traumatic childbirth last September, was smiling and relaxed during practice on Thursday but did not, apparently, feel up to fulfilling media obligations 24 hours later. It was easy to sympathise, given the shambles of an all-day rolling press conference conducted like a bank holiday weekend puppet show on the court of the newly roofed Louis Armstrong Stadium.She is expected to play – although it was uncertain whether or not the USTA would follow the bizarre ruling of the French federation, which has banned her from wearing the black catsuit she needed to contain the muscle spasms that plagued her after her emergency caesarean section.Certainly his demeanour was better than on the day he pulled out of Wimbledon this year, having given every indication he was ready. He also withdrew from the Rogers Cup in Canada after Washington, then went out in three sets in the first round of the Cincinnati Open last week.Murray has not played Duckworth, a talented player who has had his share of injury setbacks and is in the tournament after the late withdrawal of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. If Murray is anywhere near the level he showed when losing a tough three-setter at Queens to Nick Kyrgios, then beating Stan Wawrinka and losing to Kyle Edmund at Eastbourne, he should progress to the second round.He would then play either Feliciano López or Fernando Verdasco. Juan Martín del Potro is his likely opponent in the third round. The Argentinian, who won here in 2009, said on Friday: “I’m in good shape. As everybody knows, this is my favourite tournament on tour. I have big expectations playing in New York.”Del Potro, the third seed, will have higher expectations than Murray, although the British player has the memory of a titanic Olympic final win over him on which to draw.Murray does not see the status quo changing much this year. Rafael Nadal returns after skipping Cincinnati, where the second seed, Roger Federer, reached the final, losing to Novak Djokovic, who looks almost back to his best. Djokovic and Murray quit the 2017 season on the same day at Wimbledon but the Serb’s elbow injury looks to have healed far more quickly.Asked if he took comfort from the return of Djokovic, Nadal and Federer from various health problems, Murray said: “All injuries are completely different. Some are more serious than others. Someone is out for a few weeks with a muscle injury. It’s very different to somebody recovering from a surgery on certain parts of the body. It’s notoriously more difficult.“I haven’t really looked at them so much as an inspiration for a comeback. I’m trying to deal with the situation that I’ve been in as best as I can myself.“But I do feel that, once my body is right again – which takes time when you haven’t played many matches in a year – I’m sure that my level will be OK to get me competing at the top of the game again.”Meanwhile, Heather Watson beat Katie Swan 6-2, 6-4 to join Johanna Konta in the women’s draw at Flushing Meadows. The last two British hopefuls in qualifying found themselves up against each other and experience won out, with Watson defeating 19-year-old Swan in an hour and 14 minutes. Having not won a match at Flushing Meadows since lifting the junior title in 2009, Watson has now claimed three victories in a row."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57fbddf05dfdba24b46d9b15e6cd03581268c68f/0_101_3546_2128/master/3546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb20fb751bbadeca5bebfb187189d885","title":"vuelta simon yates","story":"As a Vuelta a España hoves into view with perhaps a dozen potential winners in a field of exceptional quality, topped by the Tour de France stars Nairo Quintana, Thibaut Pinot and Vincenzo Nibali, it is hard to believe there was a time when the third Grand Tour of the cycling season looked horribly out on a limb. In 1995, at the instigation of the late Hein Verbruggen, the then president of the UCI, the race was moved from its traditional late April-mid May date to the back end of the season, to a chorus of concerned voices.As late as 2008 there was still debate over the calendar slot but in recent years it has become clear that Verbruggen had a basically sound idea: the Vuelta could extend a narrative for the cycling season that would naturally peak in July with the Tour de France. It probably helps that the Tour de France has come to be dominated by Team Sky since 2012 Julys now regularly end with a bevy of Grand Tour specialists looking for a new target having failed to knock the British team off their perch. Luckily for them, that target now comes up within four weeks.This iconic ascent in the Picos, home to some of the last wolves in Europe, is the third consecutive mountain-top finish in a series that should shape the overall standings before a brutal final week. It is relatively long at 11km and comes after a lumpy stage through Asturias but the previous two days’ climbing are what make it truly tough this year.Santillana del Mar – Torrelavega, time trial\u0026nbsp(32km)The only substantial time trial in a Vuelta that is largely for the climbers, this looks pancake flat and will give the few strong time triallists a chance to regain time. A big day for Richie Porte and Rigoberto Urán if they can get here in one piece.The grand finale at the end of a short, brutal stage that has six categorised climbs and 4,000m of height gain. The final climb is not super long but the stage itself is brief enough to encourage attacking from the gun. It will be impossible for a team to control so the race could be turned upside down.With last year’s winner, Chris Froome, absent, along with Geraint Thomas – to the obvious benefit of the Tour of Britain – Quintana, Nibali and the Italian Fabio Aru top the contenders’ list by virtue of the fact that each has already won at least one Grand Tour, or in Nibali’s case all three. However, Nibali has had so little time to get over the broken vertebrae he sustained in the Tour de France that he says he has his eye on the world championship instead, while Quintana and Aru have impressed only in their inconsistency in the last couple of seasons.Like Nibali, Richie Porte and Rigoberto Urán are looking to redeem their seasons after crashes ruined their Tours de France Porte has just signed a two-year deal with Trek-Segafredo but he has still to prove he can finish on the podium of a Grand Tour. An attack of gastroenteritis on the eve of the Vuelta has not helped. Pinot is also in search of redemption: the Frenchman rode a strong Giro d’Italia, but fell apart in the final 72 hours, ending up with pneumonia that compromised the middle part of his season. If Quintana falters, Alejandro Valverde may step up, but at 38 he is surely too long in the tooth to repeat his 2009 victory.Even without Froome or Thomas, there is a serious British contender in the Bury climber Simon Yates, who led the Giro for 13 days this spring but cracked on the penultimate mountain stage. If he can make the leap to overall victory in the Vuelta, it would delight statisticians as, following Froome and Thomas’s wins in the Giro and Tour, this would be the first time the same nation had won all three Grand Tours in the same year with three different cyclists.The Dutchman Steven Kruijswijk is another credible candidate, having finished fifth in the Tour, but the young Colombian Miguel Ángel López carries more weight, figuratively at least. At 24 he has shown a near-perfect improvement curve since winning the Tour de l’Avenir in 2014 last year at the Vuelta, he took two stage wins, while this season he managed third in the Giro behind Froome and Tom Dumoulin.It is not only the candidates for the overall win who will be seeking redemption in the next few weeks. The French sprinter Nacer Bouhanni has had a season marred by disputes with his Cofidis team and is in a dire need of a major victory, while the former British champion Steve Cummings has fought ill-health and has been waiting all year for the Dimension Data team to give him a start in a major Tour.After taking stages in the Tour de France in 2015 and 2016, the Wirral racer was left frustrated when Dimension Data opted to put all their strength behind Mark Cavendish in this year’s Tour, a plan that ultimately came to nothing. Cummings acknowledges this has been a disastrous season for him – as it has for his team – which puts him in precisely the same situation as 2012, when he relaunched his career with a stage victory at Ferrol."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06018906984d5a7340f2ebb0b2b8bbd7685f181e/0_286_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29f532ecf6ebb5627042caeb49aa1fb7","title":"larry dean bampot review assembly checkpoint edinburgh","story":"Assembly Checkpoint, EdinburghDean is a standup with the popular touch and an easy swing to his style. Just don’t go expecting anything high-conceptWednesday was a day of ups and downs for standup Larry Dean. In the afternoon: a maiden nomination for the Edinburgh comedy award. Early evening: show derailed by a woman having an epileptic fit in the front row. Dean dealt with the incident as well as possible, but it disturbed his flow as the gig stopped, started and stopped again. At the end, I left with the impression of another solid and enjoyable set by the Glasgow man, but no advance on his previous work. On other days, he may make a stronger impact.The show was intended, Dean tells us, to be a celebration of loved-up life with his Australian boyfriend. But that relationship ended just before the fringe, so – one hasty rewrite later – we get a set ranging across his childhood, family, sex life and recent breakup. Much feels familiar from previous shows: the blokey take on his homosexuality his hoity-toity mum jokes about his Catholicism. My heart didn’t exactly soar at the routine about masturbating in a public toilet while someone is pooing next door. Another, about fellating a slimmer with “excess skin”, is no more high-minded but comes with a choice word-picture (“I felt like one of those Victorian photographers …”) to recommend it.This isn’t comedy distinguished by ideas, then – but there is probably no point expecting high-concept from a man who claims not to remember when he last read a book. There is still plenty to enjoy, though, from a standup with the popular touch and an easy swing to his style. The image of Dean rounding up EDL marchers with his libido, One Man and His Dog-style, will be hard to shake. The turns of phrase are vivid, too, as when he explains what he means by his dad’s “East-End-of-Glasgow look”, or says of New Zealand’s earthquakes, “I’m not used to floor weather.”Characteristically from a feelgood act who – coarse content notwithstanding – has more smooth edges than sharp ones, Dean brings even the story of his recent breakup to a heartwarming conclusion. The ex-couple’s friendship is secure, apparently – and Dean will make plenty more friends with this brand of cheeky, chatty, all-smiles comedy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a6b247bd3841a9446a70e98534da38bd233e910/0_97_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d336a2ae78c94633487ba66f1db596","title":"lindsay kemp a life in pictures","story":"The experimental British choreographer and mime, who collaborated with stars such as David Bowie and Kate Bush, has died in Italy at the age of 80"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4011e285e0fb073b92ed5ba1cc3071d3ec13336/615_4_4201_2520/master/4201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3e1742f5494a893ccef5e354f731d7a","title":"tesla to stay public after investors tell elon musk please dont do this","story":"Shareholders persuade entrepreneur electric carmaker is better off on stock marketElon Musk has abandoned his plan to take Tesla private, and said shareholders had persuaded him against the idea.The electric carmaker’s founder shocked investors earlier this month after tweeting that he was considering taking the company, which floated in June 2010, private. In a statement on Friday night Musk announced he had decided against the move based on feedback from shareholders, including institutional investors, who said they had internal rules that limited the stake they could hold in a private company.The plan was cancelled after a board meeting on Thursday, Musk said. “Although the majority of shareholders I spoke to said they would remain with Tesla if we went private, the sentiment, in a nutshell, was ‘please don’t do this’,” he wrote in the blog post.Musk initially considered privatisation because he said it would avoid the short-term pressures of reporting quarterly results. In his tweet announcing the move, which was written while he was driving to the airport, he said funding had been secured for the deal. The company, however, said later that the details still had to be worked out with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.Taking the company private would have freed Tesla from having to make quarterly financial reports to the stock market and abide by strict governance rules.Musk said he had worked with the investment firms Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Silver Lake to consider all options, and that he had also talked to investors.“Given the feedback I’ve received, it’s apparent that most of Tesla’s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company,” Musk wrote.He said his belief that there was more than enough funding to take the company private “was reinforced during this process.”Tesla has faced growing financial pressures this year as it works to build more of its Model 3 cars. He told the New York Times that he had an “excruciating” year leading Tesla.The company reported another record loss on 1 August, but Musk said he expected it to be profitable in the second half of 2018 and beyond.

I myself share those sentiments.”Varadkar’s speech, delivered first, highlighted the “dark aspects” of the Catholic church’s history. “The failures of both church and state, and wider society, created a bitter and broken heritage for so many, leaving a legacy of pain and suffering. It is a history of sorrow and shame,” he said.Child sexual abuse, the Magdalene Laundries, mother and baby homes, and illegal adoptions were “stains on our state, our society and also the Catholic church. People kept in dark corners behind closed doors, cries for help that went unheard.”He added: “Wounds are still open and there is much to be done to bring about justice and truth and healing for victims and survivors.”Varadkar called on the pope to listen to victims, insisting: “We must now ensure that from words flow actions.”The Ireland of the 21st century was “a very different place today than it was in the past,” Varadkar said. The country was more erse, less religious and had modernised its laws, “understanding that marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions, and that families come in many different, wonderful forms, including those headed by a grandparent, lone parent or same-sex parents, or parents who are orced.”The changes meant the time had come “for us to build a new, more mature relationship between church and state in Ireland – a new covenant for the 21st century”. It would be one “in which religion is no longer at the centre of our society, but in which it still has an important place”.Pope Francis’s brief visit to Ireland will be dominated by demands for action at the highest levels of the Roman Catholic church to deal with the systemic cover-up of abuse by priests and church institutions.An Alitalia flight carrying the pope, his entourage and the Vatican media corps touched down at Dublin airport just before 10.30am on Saturday for only the second papal visit to Ireland.At a low-key ceremony on the tarmac, he was greeted by politicians, bishops and dignitaries, and presented with flowers by the five-year-old daughter of Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney. A Skoda bearing a papal flag stood by to take Francis to his first engagement, meeting the Irish president, Michael Higgins, at his official residence.In the next two days, Francis will have a rapturous welcome from thousands of pilgrims who have travelled to Ireland for the Catholic church’s World Meeting of Families. But there will also be protests over the church’s handling of multiple clerical sexual abuse scandals that have catastrophically damaged its moral authority and standing in Irish society.Simon Harris, the health mininster, said it would be a weekend of mixed emotions. He tweeted ahead of the pope’s arrival: The itinerary for Francis’s short trip is filled with events typical of a papal visit: meetings with politicians, dignitaries and church leaders, homilies and speeches, popemobile tours, and masses. He will address the World Meeting of Families, a triennial gathering of Catholics from more than 100 counties, and visit the huge Marian shrine in Knock.At Phoenix Park, Francis will celebrate mass with half a million people on Sunday. At the same time, survivors of sexual abuse and their supporters will hold a vigil at Dublin’s Garden of Remembrance. Another vigil will be held at the site of a mass grave containing the remains of infants which was discovered last year at a Catholic mother-and-baby home in Tuam where almost 800 children died.The Vatican has confirmed that Francis will meet privately with survivors of clerical sexual abuse, although no details of the meeting will be disclosed in advance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3305d79dc74fe81ceb479036562329adfb7bd88/0_0_4201_2521/master/4201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee750433c5b3f854c29ac169dddb0f13","title":"nordic countries happy reputation masks sadness of young says report","story":"Exclusive: Significant minority of young people in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland ‘struggling or suffering’The Nordic countries top the polls as the happiest in the world, but the assumption that life in Scandinavia is all bicycles and big smiles disguises the sadness of a significant minority of young people, it has emerged.Among those in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland who do not say that life is good, some of the largest numbers are among the young – and particularly young women. While the reasons will vary from one inidual and one country to another, it is thought that stress, loneliness and feeling under pressure to succeed may be playing a large part in their unhappiness.Contentment in the Nordic nations has been the envy of the rest of the world. In indexes of global happiness from the UN and the OECD – measured not just by wealth but also by people’s own sense of satisfaction with their lives – the same clutch of countries always come out top. This year Finland took first place in the UN’s World Happiness Report league table, even though its GDP is below that of the US and Germany.Faced with a happiness survey, it is normal for people living in Nordic countries to score seven, eight or nine out of 10, says the report. “A value of less than seven can therefore be seen as a deviation,” it says. They looked at those who scored between five and six, whom they classified as struggling, and those who scored between zero and four, deemed to be suffering.Michael Birkjaer of the Institute, one of the authors, said young people were increasingly reporting higher stress levels and loneliness around the western world.“More and more young people are getting lonely and stressed and having mental disorders,” said Birkjaer. “We are seeing that this epidemic of mental illness and loneliness is reaching the shores of the Nordic countries.”The reasons were guesswork, he said – although the Institute plans further research. “We have some evidence as to where the problem may lie. In Denmark the perfectionism culture is a huge topic.”Young people feel they are expected to excel in exams – something referred to as “the 12th grade culture”, he said. “It is a huge debate in Denmark and not something we can ignore.”It may be that the world appears a harder place in which to prosper. “We have seen these decreases in happiness in many countries since the financial crisis, even though countries like Denmark have regained economic growth.”Social media may also play a part in the unhappiness of the young, he said. A previous government study had shown high levels of loneliness in young people. Many say they are alone when they would like to be with the people they see on Facebook or Instagram apparently having a good time.Taking into account all age groups, poor general health was most often reported by those who appear to be struggling or suffering. Poor mental health came second, followed by inequality of income, unemployment and limited social contact, which the authors used as a proxy for loneliness. Older men who were unhappy were less likely to see family and friends than older women.“Mental health problems among young people manifest themselves in the form of stress, depression, anxiety, self-harm, consumption of antidepressants and, in extreme cases, suicide. The latter is a particularly big problem in Finland, which otherwise ranks as the happiest country according to the World Happiness Report 2018. Here, suicide is responsible for one-third of all deaths among 15–24 year olds.”Ulf Andreasson, senior advisor in the policy analysis and statistics unit of the Nordic Council of Ministers and an author of the report, said they wanted to look further because everybody knows people who are not happy, in spite of the image. “We also had a feeling that being unhappy in the Nordic countries perhaps comes with some kind of stigma,” he said. “If everybody is happy and I’m unhappy, is it OK to give voice to that? We wanted to de-stigmatise being unhappy.”"},{"url":null,"title":"smart","story":"Practical, hands-on courses offer career progression and skills enhancement outside traditional CAO system"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Varadkar refers to \u0026lsquopeople kept in dark corners, behind closed doors\u0026rsquo whose cries of help went unheardVaradkar hopes papal visit will mark \u0026lsquonew chapter\u0026rsquo in Ireland\u0026rsquos relationship with churchFailure has \u0026lsquorightly given rise to outrage and remains a source of pain and shame\u0026rsquoFormer resident at Nazareth House calls on pope to do something for the survivorsPontiff has no plans to announce measures to address clerical abuse during Ireland visit\u0026lsquoIn January my faith was shattered when our daughter was diagnosed with leukemia\u0026rsquoAlmost five kilos of heroin and crack cocaine were seized in a house search in BluebellIndependent report identifies \u0026lsquoconfusion\u0026rsquo in relation to oversight of air-sea search and rescueFirm under fire for agreeing to cover cost of submissions backing new service area near EnnisPat McDonagh\u0027s proposed Co Clare project will have \u0026lsquosignificant negative impact\u0026rsquoLocal authority originally advised alternative location before councillors altered city planThe \u0026lsquogame-changing\u0026rsquo procedure reduces recovery time to as little as 48 hoursIrish Prison Service seeks to open eatery that will employ ex-offenders near MountjoyParty leader tries to head off challenge to his position in \u0026lsquoide and conquer strategy\u0026rsquoVatican spokesman says Pope Francis will address \u0026lsquocultural problem\u0026rsquo of abuse during Irish visit\u0026lsquoIn 1979, we were selling six or seven flags at a time, now I\u0026rsquom barely selling one or two\u0026rsquoPrices remain typical of any weekend in Dublin, say hotel owners"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3606797.1535147627!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"locals express shock at supermac s campaign revelations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPat McDonagh of Supermac’s. File photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyA number of established retailers and hoteliers in Ennis, Co Clare, have expressed their “shock” at the revelation that the company behind a plan to build a large motorway service area outside the town had agreed to pay the cost of submission fees in support of the plan. The business interests, who as a group have opposed the plan, have described the revelation, and the fact that some of the more than 180 supportive submissions to the council were forged, as an “unsavoury sideshow” which it hoped would not “undermine the planning process”. Businessman Pat McDonagh and his Supermac’s fast food franchise wants to build a large motorway service station, complete with retail and restaurant outlets, just off the M18, 4.8km east of Ennis.Shortly before the deadline for submissions closed this month, a single batch of more than 180 letters was received by Clare County Council. However, when the council wrote back to the supposed submitters, acknowledging also their payment of the requisite €20 fee, 40 of them contacted the council to say they had not made any submission, nor paid €20.This week, it was further revealed that Supermac’s had agreed to pay for the €20 submission fees, though no money had been handed over as yet.The company did not say who organised the campaign of submissions, only that a petition was being organised locally. It denounced the forging of signatures (which in at least one case was that of a dead person) saying: “This company is horrified to learn from the media that this exercise was not conducted legitimately and disowns the actions taken and wants to distance itself completely from them.”Yesterday, Allen Flynn, owner of the Old Ground Hotel, one of the opposing interests, said on behalf of the group that he was “genuinely shocked” that Supermac’s had agreed to reimburse people writing in letters of support.He added: “At the end of the day, the hope within our group is that this unsavoury sideshow is not allowed undermine the planning process.”Meanwhile, a woman whose late father was alleged to have made a submission in support of the plan has spoken of her surprise to find his name among those purporting to have written to Clare County Council.Paddy Russell of Clarecastle died in November 2003. His daughter Anne Marie was taken aback to learn that 15 years later, on August 10th last, he had apparently written to the council’s planning department.In the letter, the late Mr Russell declared his “full support to Mr Pat McDonagh for his recent planning submission for a Motorway Service station at Junction 12” of the M18.The letter to the council, similar to others delivered in bulk, was alleged to have been sent from Mr Russell’s home in Clarecastle.The council replied with a standard acknowledgement (for the observation letter and €20 fee), which was received at the nearby address of his daughter, whose story appeared first in the Clare Champion.“I was away last week in Germany,” Ms Russell told The , “and when I came back there was a letter addressed to my late father. When I opened it, I said ‘oh good God’.”The current occupant of her father’s former house had apparently kindly dropped the letter into his daughter’s home, some 500 meters away.Asked if she thought her father would support the plan, were he alive, Ms Russell said: “I’d say he’d go to the meetings and listen to the discussion but sure, he’d be 86 at this stage.”And her own view? “I suppose it would be good for employment but it should go through the proper channels . . . There’s something rotten with whatever is going on in Clarecastle – whatever is going on.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pope francis arrives in dublin","story":"  August 24, 2018Widespread road closures to take effect from Saturday morning to facilitate visit   August 25, 2018Pontiff has no plans to announce measures to address clerical abuse during Ireland visit "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3606832.1535141062!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"supermac s service station plan not very tasty and tempting for locals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPat McDonagh of Supermac’s. The company said it was shocked to learn that some of the letters of support for its planning application sent to Clare County Council were forged. Photograph: Joe O\u0027ShaughnessyIf the large-scale motorway service station that Supermac’s entrepreneur Pat McDonagh wants to build near Ennis in Co Clare is ever constructed, it will certainly be a feature on the landscape.But its critics say it will have a “significant negative impact” on the vitality and viability of the town centre of Ennis and two local villages, as well as breaching the policy of the Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) in relation to services on the motorway network.Supermac’s Ireland, a fast-food and retail franchise, initially sought to distance itself from this week’s controversy over forged letters of support, sent to Clare County Council among a batch of 187 submissions delivered en masse to the planning department just before the deadline for such observations.However, the admission by Pat McDonagh, Supermac’s founder, that his company agreed to underwrite the cost of the support campaign (which could run to €3,600) has placed more question marks over the whole affair.The company had said it was shocked to learn that some of the submissions were made by people who had not, in fact, written the letters bearing their names. It condemned the action “utterly” and said it disowned such support.The company is keen, nonetheless, to press on with its plans, but it is facing an amount of stiff opposition. Then came the acknowledgement that the company was financially connected to the campaign (although it says that it has yet to actually pay for the cost of the submissions).The plan remains on the table, as it were, and the council is due to make its decision by September 4th. Whether approved or rejected, it would seem likely that the losing side will appeal to An Bord Pleanála.The plan is for the development of a 4.8-hectare site just off the M18 LimerickGalway motorway at Junction 12, some 4.8km east of Ennis, and 3.5km east of the adjoining village of Clarecastle.If given the go-ahead, Mr McDonagh and Supermac’s want to construct a centrally located two-storey building with a total floor area of 2,564sq m, with 100sq m allocated for retail and 710sq m allocated for eating and seating.In addition, there would be staff and office facilities of some 188sq m, a travel and tourist information centre of 148sq m, and toilets, storage and maintenance space amounting to just under 1,000sq m.There would be parking for 142 cars, eight motorbikes, 10 coaches and 15 HGV vehicles.Ennis prides itself on being a commercially successful place in challenging times. People connected to the local chamber of commerce will tell anyone who asks that the town had six retail outlets ranked within the country’s top 100, as defined by Retail Excellence Ireland. The town has also been declared Ireland’s friendliest.So it is perhaps not surprising that local vested interests came together to oppose a plan which they say “will rip the heart out of the town”, as a spokesperson put it.Nine of them, all members of the chamber of commerce, came together and submitted a 50-page objection.The nine are the Old Ground Hotel, the Temple Gate Hotel, Hotel Woodstock, Treacy’s West County Hotel, Ryan’s Centra supermarket, Hogan’s Mace supermarket, the County Boutique, the Woollen Market and Clarke’s Daybreak supermarket and petrol station.They look at Mr McDonagh’s Barack Obama Plaza motorway service area at Moneygall and see its mirror image near their town. And when they do, they see their businesses, and the jobs and life they argue they bring to Ennis, as under serious threat.According to their submission, if the plan gets approval it will have a “significant negative impact on the vitality and viability of Ennis town centre, Clarecastle village centre and Crusheen village centre which is contrary to the policies of the Clare County Development plan 2017-2023”.They argue that the proposal is also against the policy of Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), which devises policies in relation to services on the country’s motorway network.According to TII, motorway service areas (MSAs) are “essential for driver safety and to ensure the availability of services and amenities for drivers”.In line with this, TII says there should be one “on-line service area” on the M18 between junctions 7 (which is Sixmilebridge) and 12 (which is Ennis). The “on-line” element is central to objections to the McDonagh plan.On-line means the services offered are accessed directly from the motorway. In other words, drivers leave the carriageway and drive straight into the service area, as is the case on various Applegreen service areas on, for instance, the M4 and M1.The Ennis service area would be “off-line” meaning the motorists would have to exit the motorway proper, enter other roads and drive to the service area, albeit a short distance.Mr McDonagh has twice before sought permission to develop the site. One application was turned down by An Bord Pleanála the other was withdrawn.In rejecting the first application, the board cited problems with access roads, and Clare council policies of “maintaining high-quality built and natural environment”.“The board considers that the proposed development, by reason of its design . . . would not integrate satisfactorily with the rural and predominately flat landscape in the hinterland of Ennis.”Pat McDonagh will be hoping that, this time, it is third time lucky."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

bishops, religious superiors, priests and others - adequately to address these repellent crimes has rightly given rise to outrage and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community.I myself share those sentiments.The pontiff\u0027s predecessor, Pope Benedict, has also addressed the issue.His frank and decisive intervention continues to serve as an incentive for the efforts of the church\u0027s leadership both to remedy past mistakes and to adopt stringent norms meant to ensure that they do not happen again, Francis added.He said the Church in Ireland had played a role in child welfare which could not be obscured.It is my hope that the gravity of the abuse scandals, which have cast light on the failings of many, will serve to emphasise the importance of the protection of minors and vulnerable adults on the part of society as a whole, he said.In this regard, all of us are aware of how urgent it is to provide our young people with wise guidance and sound values on their journey to maturity.The Pope said he also wished to acknowledge women who in the past had endured particularly difficult circumstances.On Northern Ireland, he praised those who helped forged the historic Good Friday Agreement in 1998.In an apparent reference to the political deadlock in Northern Ireland, which has seen the region without a properly functioning devolved government for 20 months, Francis said: We can give thanks for the two decades of peace that followed this historic agreement, while expressing firm hope that the peace process will overcome every remaining obstacle and help give birth to a future of harmony, reconciliation and mutual trust.The speech came after a private meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, and later the Irish premier urged the Pope to listen to the victims in his own address at Dublin Castle.Earlier, he met Irish President Michael D Higgins at his official residence in Phoenix Park.Pope Francis plants a tree during a meeting with Irish President Michael D Higgins, at Aras an Uachtarain in Phoenix ParkHundreds of thousands of people are expected to welcome Francis during his whistle-stop tour of the capital city and Co Mayo over the weekend.In the coming 36 hours, the Pope will witness a country that has undergone seismic social changes in the four decades since the last papal visit in 1979, when John Paul II was lauded by a nation shaped by its relationship with an all-powerful Catholic Church.Senior Irish clerics and other dignitaries gathered on the apron of the runway at Dublin Airport to greet the Pope and clapped as the Alitalia flight landed just before 10.30am.Irish and Vatican flags were flown from the cockpit windows as the aircraft taxied toward its stand.Francis emerged from the plane soon afterwards, walking down the steps to be greeted on a red carpet by Ireland\u0027s deputy premier and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, his wife, Ruth, and their three daughters, Jessica, Beth and Annalise.While the Pope is sure to receive a warm reception from the thousands of pilgrims who have travelled to be part of the occasion, he will also be met by protesters angry at how the church dealt with the sex abuse scandals that have damaged trust in the religious institution and seriously weakened its influence on Irish society.Mr Coveney acknowledged that many people had mixed feelings about the visit.I think it\u0027s been difficult for many people, for victims, for Catholics and many of the clergy, he said.But I hope and expect that this weekend will be a very powerful moment. He has a personality that can reach out to Irish people.LGBT protestors from Dublin Pride and We Are Church with flags and umbrellas on Ha\u0026#39Penny BridgeAt some point over the weekend, the Pope will meet a number of abuse victims in a private meeting.Earlier this week, he wrote a 2,000-word letter to Catholics in which he condemned the crime of sexual abuse by priests and subsequent cover-ups.He demanded accountability in response to fresh revelations in Pennsylvania in the United States of decades of misconduct by clerics.Francis is ostensibly in Ireland to attend the World Meeting of Families (WMOF) - a major global church event focused on promoting family values.However, he will also fulfil a number of other engagements.With Ireland in the midst of a high-profile homelessness problem, the Pope will meet a number of affected iniduals and families at a centre run by a religious order.Tens of thousands of people are expected to line the streets of Dublin city centre on Saturday afternoon as he passes through in his famous Popemobile.In the evening, he will join 82,000 pilgrims at a musical festival in the landmark Croke Park Gaelic Athletic Association stadium.On Sunday, the Pope will fly west to Co Mayo, where he will follow in the footsteps of John Paul II and take part in a religious service at a holy shrine in Knock.He will then return to Dublin for the closing centrepiece of the WMOF event - an outdoor Mass in front of an expected congregation of half a million people in Phoenix Park.Steve Bannon: Trump will be impeached unless Republicans hold the House of RepresentativesBlockbuster drama about scheming concubines heralds growth of Chinese cultural influence abroadVenezuela refugee crisis evokes darkest days of Europe in 2015, UN warnsFacebook accused of targeting young LGBT users with \u0026#39gay cure\u0026#39 advertsHotel fire in Chinese city of Harbin kills 18Teenage Youtube star McSkillet dies in 100mph crash going wrong way down California highwayBest independent schools in 2018: Full league table for A-Level results Dating apps and heatwave to blame for a record rise in syphilis cases, health trust saysScott Morrison named new Australian prime minister as Malcolm Turnbull ousted Hurricane Lane floods homes as some swim in powerful waves: track the storm\u0026#39s path here Private schools\u0026#39 top A-level grades drop to lowest level in eight years, figures showAbortion at home legalised after Government bows to pressure from campaignersHurricane Lane: Hawaii hit by landslides and floods as storm spins towards islands -

It was a fairly low-key event, with a portable stage not much bigger than the park’s bandstand. The lineup was comprised of mainly tribute acts.Fast forward to 2018, and Bingley Music Live, as the event evolved into, is preparing for its biggest three-day festival yet, on the weekend of Friday 31 August. This time the roster is a little more impressive: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Jake Bugg, Public Image Ltd, Shed Seven, former Spice Girl Melanie C… and all on a stage that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the summer’s big-name festivals.But, so what? Festivals are big business in the UK, and the summer calendar is stuffed with internationally-renowned acts zipping between fields across the country. Just down the road from Bradford, the Leeds Festival is twinned with its more venerable cousin Reading, and together they form the apex of the festival pyramid with old-stager Glastonbury (when it’s not having a fallow year, like this summer).But also on the calendar is Latitude, the Isle of Wight Festival, RiZE (formerly the V Festival), Wireless, Creamfields, BBC Music’s Big Weekend, Bestival… it seems that no matter where you are in the country, sling a 12in picture disc like a frisbee any time over the summer and you’re almost certain to hit a music superstar on the head.But what makes Bingley Music Live a slightly different beast is that just like the inaugural Music at Myrtle\u0026nbspevent in 1991, it is still run by the local authority. No longer free, of course, because you don’t get Noel Gallagher out of bed on the sort of money you can make up by adding a few quid on the council tax bills. But value for money certainly, compared to the big commercial festivals, and certainly pulling its weight in the ring with many of them.A spokesperson for Bradford Council said\u0026nbspthat when Music at Myrtle was set up in 1991, nobody really expected that it would become the major player it is now. She says:\u0026nbsp“When we held our first small free concert few could have envisaged that the festival would grow to attract such big names as Pet Shop Boys, Kaiser Chiefs, Manic Street Preachers, Chic and Nile Rogers, All Saints, Jess Glynne\u0026nbspand James who have all played over recent years.”The key, though, is that Bingley Music Live has grown organically. Bradford Council never set out to make a full-blown festival, it expanded a little bit year by year. She adds:\u0026nbsp“Although it has come a long way from its humble beginnings and it is unusual for a council to be involved in such a big festival we have grown it gradually and now it sees 15,000 people a day flock to the town for festival weekend.”\u0026nbspIn its early years, Music at Myrtle was split into themed days, with old rockers such as Bradford’s own Smokie on the bill, newer bands for the younger audience, and jazz. In 1998 Bradford Council partnered with local radio station Pulse to make the event a two-day festival, with Pulse using their clout and contacts book to bring in bigger names such as Liberty X, McFly, Rachel Stevens and another Bradford boy-done-good, Gareth Gates.That continued into the 2000s, until what was then billed as the Party in the Park hit its first major bump in the road. In February 2007, the event was summarily cancelled. Rising costs and declining audiences were blamed, and the Pulse’s station director, Tony Wilkinson, told the local paper,\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspArgus, that support from the music industry for such small festivals was on the wane. He said that the record labels did not have “as many artists out on promotional tours to provide a top class running order”.Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo ParkWhat nobody envisaged in 2007, though, was that the music industry was in the throes of a massive shakeup. Downloading and streaming of music was in its infancy then, and music acts still made the majority of their money from physical album and single sales. However, a decade on, that situation is reversed nowadays it’s the touring of live shows and pounding the festival beat that earns pop and rock bands a crust.It would be nice to think that Bradford Council was playing something of a blinder back in 2007, but the chances are that it was pure serendipity. Either way, within a couple of months of the announcement that the Myrtle Park festival was dead, it rose from the ashes.The original plan was to scale back on the A-listers and give more of a platform to unknown, local bands. The rescue package had been put together wholly by Bradford Council, and they were obviously mindful of the budgetary restrictions of putting on a big festival but still wanting to provide residents with a music event of some description.Indeed, it was the residents of Bingley in particular who lobbied the council to save the festival in some form. This was at a time when the financial crisis was just bubbling over, and it’s fair to say that Bradford had been hit harder than most cities. Neighbouring Leeds had stolen a march on city centre development and by the mid-2000s had a thriving retail and leisure sector that put it in a stronger position to weather the credit crunch.aren’t too far removed from its neighbouring Leeds\u0026nbspBefore the financial collapse, Bradford had been on the up as well. Large swathes of the city centre had been demolished to make way for a brand new shopping centre built by Westfield. The majority of the work on taking down the tired, old buildings began in 2004, but by 2007 everything had stalled, leaving Bradford with an infamous hole in the ground that made it look as though it was ground zero of a meteor strike. It wasn’t until 2015 that the centre was completed and opened… and, to be fair, did help to kickstart a much-needed revitalisation of Bradford.So it was understandable in that atmosphere in 2007 that people wanted some form of entertainment, and Bingley Music Live was it. That year’s festival was indeed\u0026nbsppared down, but still attracted some recognisable names – Bruce Foxton’s post-Paul Weller “From The Jam” outfit, the Charlatans, the Bluetones. The following year brought the Happy Mondays, Echo and the Bunnymen, and local heroes Terrorvision.\u0026nbspBy the time the first headliners the Charlatans returned in 2012, the festival had added a third day on the Friday, and the festival was really on an upward curve.But can a local authority really justify the cost? There are partners of course, including Ticketline, Mercure Hotels and Carlsberg. But surely it doesn’t make any money?According to a Bradford Council reply to a freedom of information request last month asking for income and expenditure on Bingley Music Live over the past three years, in 2015 there was income of £946,000 against just over £1m in costs. In 2016 income was down at £822,000 against very similar costs, but last year, with costs standing at £1.15m, there was gross income of £1.3m… leaving a net surplus of £222,000.Having attended the event last year, those figure’s aren’t surprising. It was packed and money was flowing over the bars and food concessions. It’s also a very family-oriented event. And with ticket sales ensuring 15,000 come through the gates every day this year –\u0026nbspwhich the coup of booking Noel Gallagher has certainly helped with –\u0026nbspit looks likely that Bingley Music Live is on an upward trend.Being in the middle of one of the Bradford district’s big towns as well, rather than in splendid isolation on a field somewhere in Hampshire, there are extra benefits. My council spokesperson says: “The event is a big thing for Bingley’s businesses, with its many excellent pubs, bars, shops and places to eat all busy with people for the full weekend. The festival is also embraced by the local Bradford and Bingley Sports Club who provide camping for festivalgoers on their fields.”Ariana Grande and James Corden perform hit-filled version of TitanicWhy drag queen Vicky Vox is starring in Little Shop of HorrorsCamp Bestival forced to close early due to poor weather conditionsWhile Bingley Music Live might be unusual in being local authority-run, its model of being an “urban festival” is one that is becoming increasingly popular… and can pay idends for local economies.Journalist Claude Lynch, writing in CityMetric earlier this year, said that while the big, camp-out-all-weekend festivals were declining, smaller, urban festivals were thriving… and possibly because of a sense of community. He wrote: “Multiple studies into the dynamics and economics of festivals make similar arguments about how to drive ‘re-patronising’ – in other words, how to make festivalgoers want to come back next year. Evidence suggests that ‘social identification’ – having something in common with other festivalgoers – is often just as important as the quality of the music or the food. Festivals can capitalise on this boon of social identification by offering a self-contained event designed\u0026nbspwith both locals and tourists in mind. Locals are more likely to patronise events that emphasise community spirit while tourists are enthused by events that symbolise and epitomise the local culture.”From very humble beginnings 27 years ago, Bingley Music Live has survived and thrived, often against the odds, and when international superstar Noel Gallagher takes the stage in a couple of weeks’ time, it will be the culmination of the dogged determination that gets things done in this part of the world… and looks like providing the template for the future of live music.For more information go to bingleymusicliveMusic at MyrtleEnter

huge number of brands, ranging from Always to Vicks, has filed applications with the US Patent and Trademark Office to trademark FML (f**k\u0026nbspmy life), LOL (laughing out loud), NBD (no big deal) and WTF (what the f**k).According to the applications, P\u0026ampG hopes to use the phrases to advertise a variety of cleaning products, including liquid soap, dishwashing detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners.The filings were made by P\u0026ampG in April of this year, and are still being considered by the US PTO, which has requested clarification from the company, according to trade magazine Ad Age. \u0026nbspProcter \u0026amp Gamble declined to comment on the applications.While the company may now be trying to use online millennial culture to promote its goods, one of

is expected to “skim past” our planet in the next few\u0026nbspdays.\u0026nbspAs it hurtles through space at a speed of\u0026nbspover 20,000 miles per hour, a number of news reports have highlighted the\u0026nbsp“close approach”\u0026nbspit will make towards Earth.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGiven the potential devastation that could result from the collision, here\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsplooks at\u0026nbspwhat this asteroid actually is and how likely it is to hit us.\u0026nbspNF23 is a relatively large asteroid that, according to current Nasa data, will make what the agency calls a “close approach” to Earth on 29 August.It is classified as an “Atens” body, which means its orbit comes into the vicinity of Earth.Some have described as bigger than the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Colosseum and the London Eye, while others have opted for more local comparisons\u0026nbspusing Leicester Cathedral and the Victoria shopping centre in Nottingham as the yardstick against which to measure this cosmic visitor.Nasa estimates the asteroid is somewhere between 70 and 160m in diameter, meaning that if it was at the bigger end of the scale it would indeed rival major landmarks like the pyramid.Almost certainly not. While Nasa has described the asteroid as “potentially hazardous”, it\u0026nbspis expected to pass us by a distance of 3 million miles.The diameter of the Earth is about 8,000 miles. Any object that comes within 4.6 million miles of the planet comes under the “potentially hazardous” category.Other asteroids are actually expected to pass much closer to our planet in the coming days, although admittedly ones only measuring around 6m.Nasa have previously issued a statement saying that “no asteroid currently known is predicted to impact Earth for the next 100 years”.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/24/13/liam-fox-china.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3905566  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 24 August 2018  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/24/13/liam-fox-china.jpg","title":"british women top drinkers in world aberystwyth university","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027More parity in drinking may in part be due to more women engaging in paid work\u0026nbspand therefore in post-work drinking.

Police are investigating the scene after a man and woman were exposed to nerve agent novichok and are in critical conditionDr Mackiewicz, whose research looks at women in the 16-24 age bracket,\u0026nbspsaid there was a greater stigma attached to women drinking than there was to men.“If men go out drinking, it’s ‘oh they are a typical male’ but if a woman goes out drinking, it’s seen as dreadful. Tabloid articles always pick on women - they will always have pictures of women half-dressed drinking. It’s been happening since the 18th century. William Hogarth, a London artist, had a series of prints where women are condoned for drinking alcohol.”\u0026nbspThe study found that among countries where alcohol consumption is commonplace, just two other countries - South Korea and the Gambia - witnessed men and women consuming the same quantities. However, in both instances, it was considerably lower levels than those in Britain.In historic terms, far more men drank alcohol than women. Men born between 1891 and 1910 were twice as likely as their female counterparts to consume alcohol and more than three times as likely to be involved in problematic use.But a study published in the journal BMJ Open in 2016 found that in all three respects, this had almost reached parity among those born between 1991 and 2000.Katherine Twamley, senior lecturer in sociology at University College London, said the stigma which surrounded women and drinking had declined.“On the face of it, this research does suggest more convergence among men and women in their practices,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“More parity in drinking may in part be due to more women engaging in paid work\u0026nbspand therefore in post-work drinking. There is also much less stigma around women drinking than say 50 years ago. These can be considered as positive changes for many women.”\u0026nbsp“But as a feminist scholar, I would say that huge amounts of feminist debate has centred around the kind of gender equality we aspire to as well as how we can achieve it. As in, do we want women to become just like men?\u0026nbsp“Traditionally masculine behaviours are in general more respected in society - competitiveness, risk-taking, ambition - while behaviours traditionally associated with femininity and women have received less respect - such as care and compassion.\u0026nbsp“For me, to see parity in drinking alcohol as a boon for gender equality is a mistake, especially as it relates to dangerously high levels. This could be seen as a further signifier that traditionally male culture is being seen as the standard by which women should live.\u0026nbsp“That is a race to the bottom\u0026nbspin this particular instance. And given that women experience worse health impacts for the same amount of alcohol intake, one could say that it is, in fact, a sign of further inequality rather than equality.”\u0026nbspThe new study also found giving up drinking completely is the only way to avoid the health risks associated with alcohol.Alcohol-related problems kill around seven per cent of men and two per cent of women every year\u0026nbspand drinking is the leading cause of death and disability for people aged 15-49.Despite previous research suggesting\u0026nbspmoderate levels of drinking may protect against heart disease, the new research concluded that any supposed health benefits\u0026nbspare radically offset by the costs.Addressing the findings on women, Andrew Misell, a director at Alcohol ConcernAlcohol Research UK, told The Independent:\u0026nbsp“Women have been drinking more like men for a number of years now, and as a result, alcohol-related health problems amongst women are increasing. But the reasons why women are drinking more is complex.\u0026nbsp“One of the key reasons links to changes in society where women are much freer to choose their own lifestyle today than they were in previous decades. Of course, none of us would want to change our freedom of choice in this or many other issues.\u0026nbsp“But the fact of the matter is that we all, male and female, need to consider our relationship with alcohol – how we drink and why and consider whether we need to change our drinking habits to improve our health and wellbeing both for the short and long-term.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/24/13/liam-fox-china.jpg","title":"wetherspoons dog ban uk pubs chain pet owners","story":"Created with Sketch.Chain spokesman says the pets\u0026nbspare ‘unpredictable’\u0026nbspand cause too much messClick to followThe IndependentNew policy will be strictly enforcedWetherspoons bans dogs in all of its pubs across BritainJD Wetherspoon has decided to ban customers from bringing dogs inside any of the company’s\u0026nbsppubs across the country. \u0026nbspThe popular chain has announced it would be “strictly enforcing” a nationwide ban on canines from 10 September.A spokesman for Wetherspoon\u0026nbspsaid dogs were “unpredictable” and causing too much mess, so its previous\u0026nbsplight-touch\u0026nbsppolicy on the pets would be coming to an end.Man ‘steals fruit machine cash’ in front of Wetherspoons drinkersWetherspoons staff ‘refuse to serve breakfast to homeless men’Wetherspoon’s warns it could run out of beer due to CO2 shortageWill Wetherspoons really only sell British booze post-Brexit?“Even well behaved dogs can be unpredictable –\u0026nbspevery dog owner thinks their dog is perfect,” said Eddied Gershon.“We welcome a lot of children and families and younger children in particular can be unpredictable around dogs and many are scared of dogs.“We serve a lot of food.

There are not the parliamentary numbers to support a no-deal Brexit,” he said.“And I will vote, as a Conservative MP, in whatever way is necessary, on whatever motion will achieve the result of stopping a no-deal Brexit.”Theresa May has insisted leaving without any agreement remains an option – despite her own civil servants warning of food and medicine shortages and huge tailbacks at the UK’s borders.The prospect has appeared to grow over the summer as the talks remain deadlocked, with some Tories – led by Jacob Rees-Mogg and Iain Duncan Smith – insisting it holds no fears.But The Independent revealed in June that pro-EU Tories are considering using a “humble address” – the tactic Labour used to force the government to release Brexit economic assessments – to block a no-deal\u0026nbspexit.Now Mr Boles, the former skills and housing minister, has echoed that readiness, arguing his party must pursue a “reasonable Brexit deal that everybody can live with”.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens

not support a no-deal Brexit,” he told the Financial Times.Such a revolt would almost certainly be sufficient to deliver a Commons majority to prevent the UK crashing out, teaming up with the opposition parties.It would be likely to force the prime minister back to the negotiating table, perhaps with a request to the EU to extend the Article 50 deadline beyond March next year.The crisis could also open the door to a fresh referendum, giving voters the option to remain in the EU, if the prime minister is unable to win parliament’s approval for her strategy.The Tories\u0027 plan for a

could disrupt delivery of foreign sperm to BritainA deal struck with some Tory rebels in June means a “meaningful vote” motion – to be tabled if no Brexit agreement has been struck by next January – cannot be amended.Instead, MPs would merely be able to debate the stalemate, even with departure day from the EU little more than two months’ away at that point.However, under parliamentary rules, a humble address can be laid by a group of backbenchers – as well as by the Opposition – and that vote is binding on the government.Some pro-Brexit Tories simply believe the no-deal threat strengthens Britain’s hand in the exit talks – but others are desperate for that “clean break”, rather than to accept further compromise with Brussels.In the interview, Mr Boles, a former supporter of remaining in the EU, condemned “intolerant, intemperate talk” obstructing a Brexit compromise.“What we can’t allow is for one side to win and to grind the faces of the other side in the dust,” he said. “I put colleagues of mine in both camps squarely in my sights when I say that.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our

infighting has erupted again\u0026nbspas Conservative Brexiteers accused Philip Hammond\u0026nbsp of launching another “dodgy Project Fear” with warnings over the economic impact of a no-deal

fall by 10 per cent.But his remarks came just hours after his cabinet colleague and Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, attempted to reassure the public over a disorderly exit and cited “opportunities” that could arise.Labour not taking new Brexit deal vote off the table, McDonnell saysConservatives reject Banks’ attempt to join partyUK expats face losing access to pensions in event of no-deal

can be achieved, but that leaving on WTO terms is not as absurdly frightening as the chancellor of the Exchequer thinks it may be.“The Treasury’s Brexit panic means you can no longer trust the Treasury’s forecasts.”Marcus Fysh, a second Tory MP, referred to the Treasury’s previous “dubious” forecasts before adding that the chancellor seemed “determined to wheel them out again for yet another instalment of dodgy project fear”.A government source also told the Daily : “This was a deliberate intervention by Philip, he knew exactly what he was doing.”Pro-EU campaigners described the contents of the letter as a “Brexit bazooka” while John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Mr Hammond ad threw a “hand grenade” into the debate over a no-deal scenario.But the Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, defended the chancellor, claiming the letter published on Thursday said “nothing new” and that Mr Hammond was “absolutely committed” to the prime minister’s Chequers blueprint for Brexit.“This is provisional analysis that the Treasury published back in January this year and I think all Philip was doing was simply referring back to that in response to a senior member of parliament,” Mr Lidington told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.In his letter, addressed to the senior Tory MP and chair of the Treasury Select Committee, Nicky Morgan, Mr Hammond said: “This January provisional analysis estimated that in a no-dealWTO scenario, GDP would be 7.7 per cent lower (range 5.0 per cent -10.3 per cent) relative to a status quo baseline. This represents the potential expected static state around 15 years out from the exit point.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union “The analysis did not estimate the path the economy and different sectors might take under no deal and the potential for short-term disruption.”He added: “GDP impacts of this magnitude, were they to arise, would have large fiscal consequences.”In her response, the pro-EU MP, Ms Morgan, replied: “The chancellor has confirmed that the government forecasts a disastrous hit to our economy and living standards in the event of a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit.”The row came as the World Trade Organisation director general Roberto Azevedo has said a no-deal Brexit would not “be the end of the world” but added it would not be “a walk in the park either”.Kael De Gucht, the former European commissioner for trade, also suggested the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was “highly unlikely” and that he believed at the very least a “very vague deal” will be agreed before Britain formally leaves the bloc in March 2019.“In the end there will be a deal,” he told said. “Whether this is a solution is quite a different question.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/07/19/texas-dems.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/07/19/texas-dems.jpg","title":"ted cruz beto orourke nfl players texas funding kneeling hollywood fundraising","story":"Created with Sketch.Analysts say the Texan\u0027s comments could prove to be a winning strategy in the 2018 midterm electionsClick to followThe Independent USTexas Congressman Beto O\u0027Rourke addresses the press after he and other politicians visited the tent city June 23, 2018 in Tornillo, TexasWhat Democrats can learn from Beto O\u0027Rourke viral speech on patriotism and peaceful protestDemocrats are taking notes after Beto O’Rourke’s comments defending NFL players for kneeling during the US national anthem garnered nationwide support.\u0026nbspThe Texas congressman — whose long shot senatorial campaign against Ted Cruz now trails the incumbent by just four per cent, according to the latest polls — made headlines this week when he said he could “think of nothing more American” than peaceful protests like the NFL’s national anthem demonstrations.In a video that has since received millions of views, the Democratic candidate (running in a deeply red state) displayed genuine appreciation at a recent campaign stop for the NFL players carrying out the protests. Political analysts have pointed to the comments as a potentially winning strategy for Democrats faced with answering isive comments along the campaign trail leading up to the 2018 midterms — from Donald Trump’s impeachment, to kneeling during the anthem.In an off-the-cuff statement, Mr O’Rourke highlighted peaceful protests shaping American society throughout history while focusing on the actual issues NFL players are attempting to spotlight by kneeling during their televised games.“My short answer is no, I don’t think it’s disrespectful,”\u0026nbspMr O’Rourke said when asked about his thoughts on the matter from a voter. “Here’s my longer answer, but I’m gonna try to make sure that I get this right because I think it’s a really important question. And reasonable people can disagree on this issue. Let’s begin there. And it makes them no less American to come down on a different conclusion on this issue, right?”“Peaceful, non-violent protests, including taking a knee at a football game point out that black men, unarmed, black teenagers, unarmed and black children, unarmed, are being killed at a frightening level right now, including by members of law enforcement, without accountability, and without justice,” he added. “And this problem – as grave as it is – is not gonna fix itself and they’re frustrated, frankly, with people like me, and those in positions of public trust and power, who have been unable to resolve this or bring justice for what has been done and to stop it from continuing to happen in this country.“And so non-violently, peacefully, while the eyes of this country are watching these games, they take a knee to bring our attention and our focus to this problem to ensure that we fix it. That is why they are doing it. And I can think of nothing more American than to peacefully stand up, or take a knee, for your rights, any time, anywhere, in any place.”The comments sparked massive support from Americans of various backgrounds and affiliations, from celebrities and athletes to elected officials and moderate voices.\u0026nbspThey also began a conversation about how Democratic candidates should answer questions with honesty and compassion towards a variety of perspectives, especially during a politically ided time like 2018.\u0026nbsp“A great example of a person who does this well is Beto O’Rourke in Texas,”\u0026nbspsaid Jon Favreau, Barack Obama’s former director of speechwriting, in this week’s episode of the podcast Pod Save America. “The way he answers some of these questions, the way that he talks to his constituents, it’s like, ‘reasonable people can disagree on this issue. On one hand he’s a strong progressive, he’s an unafraid progressive, he’s a confident progressive on a whole bunch of different issues,” he added,\u0026nbsp”but on the other, he’s willing to use a language which says, ‘yeah, I’m willing to cooperate and compromise with Republicans — when it helps your life’.”\u0026nbsp“We don’t know if Beto can pull this off,” he added, “but the campaign that he is running and how he answers questions, and how he talks about issues, that is the model for candidates in 2018 and 2020, whether or not he pulls this off.”Ted Cruz criticised Mr O’Rourke after the comments went viral, claiming his Democratic opponent “raised big” money from Hollywood for his defence of the football players.“Beto raising big $$ from Hollywood by supporting NFL protests of the national anthem,”\u0026nbspMr Cruz wrote on Twitter. “But in Texas? Vast majority of Texans stand for the flag, honor our veterans, and support the brave men \u0026amp women of law enforcement”.“People can protest without disrespecting the flag,”\u0026nbsphe continued.\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesIsrael\u0027s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, second from left, speaks as Lithuania\u0027s Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis, second from right, Latvia\u0027s Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis, left, and Estonia\u0027s Prime Minister Juri Ratas listen during a news conference at the Martynas Mazvydas National Library in Vilnius, Lithuania.

But the president has dropped into a number of battleground states, visiting Pennsylvania, Alabama and Ohio before elections there this year.\u0026nbspMr O’Rourke, a one-time punk rocker who has spent the past 18 months visiting all of Texas’ 254 counties, has consistently out-raised Mr Cruz, including raking in $10.4mn to the incumbent’s $4.6mn during the three-month period through June.\u0026nbspHis campaign declined to comment about the prospect of Mr Trump coming to Texas. Mr Cruz remains favoured in the race, but told hundreds who thronged a recent rally:\u0026nbsp“We’ve got a battle on our hands.”“The far left is angry,”\u0026nbsphe said. “They’re energised and they’re filled with rage and fury at the president. That’s dangerous”.Cruz attacks Democrat for using a nickname even though he do the sameFormer Obama cabinet secretary warns Ted Cruz: ‘be very afraid’Ted Cruz posts Zodiac killer puzzle on TwitterHowever, Mr O’Rourke is now receiving unexpected support leading up to the midterm elections from a host of voices and influential personalities who otherwise may not have ever learned of his candidacy were it not for his NFL comments.\u0026nbspPro Bowl running back Arian Foster has begun campaigning for the Democrat, joining him at multiple campaign stops and travelling across Texas on Thursday.Mr O’Rourke is now running political ads across the state highlighting his comments about the NFL.

A month later, Russia’s Supreme Court upheld the decision and ordered the group’s official representation to disband. \u0026nbsp“It doesn’t matter where in Russia they try to worship – in their meeting houses, which the state is beginning to confiscate, or in private homes,” said\u0026nbspGeraldine Fagan, author of Believing in Russia – Religious Policy after Communism. “It\u0026nbsprepresents the worst roll back of religious freedom since the fall of Communism.” \u0026nbspIt is unclear exactly why the Kremlin chose to use its broad extremist laws against the movement. Initially\u0026nbspthe Russian Justice Ministry’s moves against the group appeared to be\u0026nbspa response to an aggressive leafleting campaign.\u0026nbspSome have suggested the group’s opposition to overt patriotism and violence played a role. The influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, which views Jehovah’s Witnesses as a dangerous sect, is also apparent.\u0026nbspIn the 17 months since the ban was enacted, dozens of Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses have been arrested. Most of an\u0026nbspestimated 175,000 members of the denomination\u0026nbspin Russia no longer advertise their faith. Many, it seems, are looking for new lives elsewhere.\u0026nbspAccording to the Finnish Immigration Service, the number of applications from Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses grew from five in 2016 to more than\u0026nbsp100 in 2017 and 2018. The number of asylum applications also grew, from 193 in 2016 to 309 in the year to date. The\u0026nbsplatter figure\u0026nbspincludes all kinds of groups – from opposition activists to refugees from the northern Caucasus.Finnish immigration officials told The Independent the vast majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses applications have yet to be processed. There had been only a “handful” of accepted applications and a “handful” of negative decisions, officials\u0026nbspsaid with nearly all of those rejected since appealing.\u0026nbsp“Each of the cases is dealt with on an inidual basis,” The Independent was told. “Persecution of these groups has not been systematic across Russia, and the approach of the ministry has taken this into account.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaks to the media during a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, AustraliaHigh waves hit Jeju Island, South Korea, as powerful Typhoon Soulik gradually approaches the Korean PeninsulaA Palestinian man throws his child in the air following morning prayers marking the first day of Eid al-Adha celebrations on the compound known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem\u0027s Old City.

Austria makes its BIGGEST EU priority avoiding hard BrexitMr Howe explained that studies on the effective costs of a no deal showed Britain would still have to pay around \u0026pound5billion in tariffs to Brussels but insisted it would be significantly less than its current contributions.He continued: The European Union would naturally, in fact, it\u0026rsquos required by WTO rules, to impose the same tariffs on imports from the UK as it does from the rest of the world.Studies have been done on how much that would be and that\u0026rsquos around \u0026pound5billion a year which exporters pay, it\u0026rsquos under half our current net budget contribution.Time is running out and if no deal is struck by the time we leave in March the UK will revert to trading under WTO rules.Brexit news: Martin Howe described the pretty vast effect a no deal would have on UK consumers (Image: CHANNEL 4 NEWS)Under a no deal\u0026nbspscenario, Britain can enter into free trade agreements without the imposition of costly tariffs.David Paton, professor of industrial economics at Nottingham University Business School, said: \u0026ldquoBrexit provides the UK with a historic opportunity but only if we choose to free ourselves from EU protectionism and leave the customs union and single market.By doing so, we can expand our links with the fastest growing economies around the world, decrease prices in the shops and re-design our economic and tax policy in a way which works for the UK rather than having to do as we are told by the European Commission.The Department for Exiting the European Union said: \u0026ldquoWe firmly believe it is in the interests of both the EU and the UK to strike a deal. That remains the goal on both sides and we are confident that this will be achieved.\u0026ldquoBut it is the job of a responsible Government to prepare for all scenarios, including the unlikely event that we reach March 2019 without agreeing on a deal.

There is no core of resident UK workers who would be encouraged to work in our industry.To help solve the problem post-Brexit, Mr Chambers claimed it \u0026ldquowould mean the reintroduction of season agricultural workers scheme which as very successful all the way through the 1960\u0026rsquos, 70\u0026rsquos, 80\u0026rsquos and 90\u0026rsquos and even the early 2000\u0026rsquos.He said: \u0026ldquoThat gave us a good supply of keen, eager, enthusiastic workers from eastern Europe, who were prepared to come and work here for relatively short periods, because of\u0026nbspthe seasonal\u0026nbspnature of our business, and they would all go home.\u0026ldquoThe benefit for them was not that they were living in the UK, it was the ability to earn pounds, which then when they took them back into their own currency it gave them very good return for their effort.Mr Chambers claimed\u0026nbspBritish\u0026nbsppeople could pick fruit, but claimed UK workers would be less productive and they simply would not be able to recruit enough workers to fill the roles.He said: \u0026ldquoBritish people can do the jobs, it\u0026rsquos not rocket science, it just requires two arms and two legs.\u0026ldquoThe reason British people would not be encouraged to do the jobs is because they are seasonal, so you would have to\u0026nbspcome and\u0026nbsplive on\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspfarm, because you need to start very early in the morning or work as a time period, after six months or five months or three months, when the crop finishes you then need to go and find another job. Living in the UK you need a steadier income.Brexit news: Tim Chambers claimed the UK very good opportunity to prosper outside of the EU (Image: EXPRESS)Mr Chambers added his farm would not be able to recruit the\u0026nbspnumber\u0026nbspof workers they needed in the south of England.He said: \u0026ldquoI think the national unemployment is around four\u0026nbsppercent, in the southeast it is just over three\u0026nbsppercent. Our farm needs 1,400 to 1,500 people to work, there\u0026rsquos not that number of people in Kent probably unemployed and we are just one farm in Kent.Mr Chambers also claimed British people would be \u0026ldquoless productive. He said: \u0026ldquoIf you are coming from eastern Europe and you think of your own money, not in pounds, it feels you are earning a very good salary, so the incentive is there to push a little bit harder and work a little bit faster.When asked about what it would mean if British people took the roles seasonal workers currently fill, Mr Chambers explained how it could push fruit prices up.He said: \u0026ldquoIf we had to employ English people to harvest our fruit I would guess it could cost us 15 to 20\u0026nbsppercent\u0026nbspmore to the harvest cost.Mr Chambers said this increase would be reflected on British shoppers in the supermarkets, but added it was \u0026ldquohypothetical to estimate.Despite concerns,\u0026nbspMr Chambers is confident Britain will be able to overcome any issues facing it as a result of Brexit.The berry farmer said his farm lost crops in the summer last\u0026nbspyear\u0026nbspas a result of recruitment\u0026nbspand said he knows of farms in the north that are struggling to recruit seasonal workers this year.But Mr Chambers was confident about the country being able to make a success of leaving the EU.He said: \u0026ldquoThere are lots of countries out there who are doing very well outside of the European Union and the global economy is changing so you have got Africa, South-East Asia, South America, they are growing populations with growing demands for goods and services and within the EU we are slightly restrained with what we can do.\u0026ldquoI think the country has a very good opportunity outside of the European Union to trade and to prosper.\u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think for our industry, my sector of industry which is just berries and horticulture, it is very specific, I don\u0026rsquot think initially there is any problem that we could not solve.National Farming Union President, Minette Batters, last month outlined the importance in Britain still being able to attract seasonal workers from the EU.She said: \u0026ldquoIt is an absolute priority that we do manage to ensure we get a global agricultural scheme in place. We are asking the Government to trial this.\u0026ldquoWe have seen an enormous shortfall in workers coming here from the EU and that has been massively exacerbated by the feeling of uncertainty, the exchange rate, this is incredibly urgent.Early this year Michael Gove signalled he would support a special deal for farm workers after Brexit and said the case for a seasonal agricultural workers scheme after the UK leaves the EU next year was \u0026ldquocompelling.A Defra spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe understand the importance of seasonal labour in supporting a successful and effective agricultural sector, and are considering how best to support the needs of the sector both before and after the UK exits the EU.

Will our current free movement regime be rebadged as a “Labour Mobility Framework”?Such a move, speculated on in the media this week, would be politically toxic and very poorly timed. It would also betray her own instincts, which she rightly gave voice to when she became Prime Minister.Striking a chord with millions of people angry and alienated at their voices being ignored by the political elite on immigration and the downside of globalisation, delivered for her record poll ratings then and a real feeling of hope that at last people in power were listening.Yes, the main driver for the Leave vote was about democracy, independence and national sovereignty but it was also about the fundamental choice that a UK outside the EU would have: Who comes to our country and on what basis – decided by our own Parliament.Voters have noticed that the tightening of the labour market and record employment levels, as revealed by the Office for National Statistics last week, mean that at long last real wages – i.e. pay packets less inflation – are slowly rising and that belatedly big business is beginning to move away from an over reliance on cheap foreign labour, undercutting the pay and conditions of indigenous workers and giving rise to higher welfare dependency.It might seem a radical concept, but such employers might just have to pay workers decent wages, train them better, improve their skills and try hard to retain them. That’s why EU workers are still coming to the UK in huge numbers, despite ridiculous Project Fear stories to the contrary.So yes – Brexit will mean higher pay for British workers! Top businessman Stuart Rose, briefly spokesman for the Remain campaign, accurately predicted such a development before the EU Referendum.Regrettably, the multinationals’ trades union, the CBI didn’t get the message: No surprise that they now want no restrictions on foreign workers post Brexit – in other words an endless pool of cheap labour just like now.Likewise, they’re happy to defend the growing gap between average pay and that of FTSE 100 bosses.Ironically, The Prime Minister could still snatch victory from defeat on this issue, notwithstanding her lamentable record as Home Secretary on reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands.The alternative White Paper which David Davis and his Ministers were working on prior to it being dumped at Chequers, was much more evidence-based and looked to many workable international examples of mobility agreements between first world countries like Australia, the United States, Japan and Canada, as a model for future EU-UK immigration arrangements, to our mutual benefit.The policy would have been informed by the Migration Advisory Committee which reports next month, focused on what was the sensible policy for the whole of the UK and all business sectors rather than a noisy minority and their well-paid advocates.It also sought to end the systemic bias towards low paid and low skilled EU citizens over the well qualified from across the globe.It was pro controlled immigration and not about pulling up the drawbridge and that’s where most British voters are now.Will Theresa May use the opportunity to keep faith with the millions of people in the north and the midlands, in south Wales and south west, who look to her to keep her promises and defend their interests and not just those of the well heeled, the multinationals and those comfortable with the Brussels status quo?Will putative leadership contender Sajid Javid have the courage to resist further attempts at craven supplication on continuing free movement in all but name? Will Conservative MPs who benefited from the highest ever blue collar vote for their party in history, ignore their own electors’ concerns and just accept further concessions?The electoral prospects of her party depend on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Appropriation.In the eyes of today’s politically correct policers of “wrongthink”, there is no greater crime than cultural appropriation.Cultural appropriation is when people embrace the grub or music or ideas of a culture that isn’t theirs.Like when Kylie Jenner wore her hair in cornrows. Or when Katy Perry donned a Japanese kimono. Or when drunken lads on a university campus put on sombreros as they neck shots of tequila.All of these things have been branded cultural appropriation by today’s potty warriors against “offensiveness”.And to this blacklist of things we must never appropriate, we can now add non-native foods.This is not the first time Jamie Oliver has been criticised for making foreign dishes. Two years ago foodies were up in arms when he put chorizo in paella — which the Spanish tend not to do.Clearly Jamie Oliver is only allowed to cook “white” British food, like roast beef and toad-in-the-hole.Not Cornish pasties or Yorkshire puddings, though.After all, what right does a man born in Essex have to appropriate the food of Northerners and people from the West Country? And presumably Dawn Butler only ever tucks into Jamaican dishes.If it is cultural appropriation for Oliver to make jerk grub, surely it must be cultural appropriation for Ms Butler to rattle up a bit of sushi?This would be the crazy conclusion to the war on cultural appropriation — none of us would ever dip into other cultures and experience their pleasures.What is most depressing about the Butler/Oliver spat is that it confirms how mainstream the miserabilist, divisive PC worldview has gone.It used to be just time-rich posh kids and snowflakes on university campuses who raged against cultural appropriation.Like the officious students at Cambridge who banned an Around The World in 80 Days fancy-dress party for fear students would wear “culturally appropriated” costumes.Or the clipboard bores at the University of East Anglia who banned students from wearing sombreros.Or the easily offended muppets at the University of Ottawa in Canada who banned a yoga class, because for white people to indulge in this ancient Indian discipline is an act of “cultural genocide”.I bet you never knew that when you do a pelvic tilt at your local gym you are being a horrible racist.Now, however, with Butler’s missive against the crimes of Jamie Oliver, this PC claptrap has crept from the fringes into the political centre. Butler is Shadow Secretary for Women and Equalities, and she is very close to Jeremy Corbyn.Is this what we should expect under a Corbyn government? Finger-wagging at anyone who deviates from PC rules?The worst thing about the clampdown on cultural appropriation is how divisive it is. The message is that we must always stick with our own cultures and never borrow from others.Didn’t that used to be known as racism?In recent years, Beyonce has been slammed for wearing a sari. Glastonbury has banned attendees from wearing Native American head-dresses.

They both agreed: too much soy sauce, but otherwise delicious. Last month Gwen van der Zwan, from the Netherlands, tried cannibalism for the first time.However, shes no Hannibal Lecter and no humans were hurt in the making of her dinner.Instead, she made the meal from her own blood - which she had painstakingly drained into a medical bag that day - after becoming fascinated with the idea of trying a human sausage.Why is my idea considered disgusting, but doing the same thing with pigs blood isnt? she asked at the time.Although shes rare in acting publicly on her unusual tastes, Gwen is far from the only one to be fascinated by cannibalism.Dating-style fetish sites match up those desperate for human flesh with those who want nothing more than to be eaten alive themselves.Cannibal seeks meal, one post reads. This 37 year old male seeks a nice cute piece of meat. I prefer girls.Another says: Im a thirty-something man looking for a female so we can sample each others flesh. Cut together, cook together, and eat together. Non-lethal cuts so we can enjoy eating one another. Would-be victims refer to themselves as longpigs - a term meaning human flesh which was used by man-eating Pacific islanders who thought people tasted like pork.But why would anyone want to eat, or be eaten by, someone else?Experts say that cannibalism is largely to do with power - breaking the ultimate taboo leaves man-eaters feeling euphoric.Therapist Karen Hylen has even suggested that cannibalism can become addictive for a small number of people with psychopathic tendencies, comparing the act of eating someone to a cocaine high.On Reddit, a growing number of posters chat openly about their fascination with cannibalism, although comments seem to often be driven more by a morbid curiosity than anything else.Bill Schutt, author of Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History, ate a human placenta when writing his book.He told Sun Online: We think cannibalism is revolting because thats what our culture dictates. Other cultures that didn’t get that memo have had very different attitudes toward cannibalism. For example, in the mid-20th century, the Wari people of Brazil were apparently just as upset to find that Western anthropologists buried their dead as the anthropologists were aghast to learn that the Wari ate their loved ones after they died.In June, a 38-year-old man took to Reddit to share the story (verified by Vice) of a dinner party where his friends tucked into a meal made from his amputated foot.After a motorbike accident in 2016, he had the smashed limb cut off - and doctors let him keep it.Then, three weeks later, he threw a brunch for ten willing friends where the main course was tacos made from the flesh which had been amputated.The anonymous man posted photos of the dish, and explained how he kept his mangled foot in the freezer until it was time to cook it.Then he cut out a chunk of flesh, marinated it overnight and sauteed it with onions, peppers and lime juice.Posting on Reddit, he says: I taste like buffalo. But chewier. Super beefy and a little fat. We werent looking to go all Hannibal and get gourmet - just to make it so no one gagged.My friends and I always had this joke, he adds. If you could try human flesh in an ethical and healthy way, would you? And we always said of course. Well the opportunity came up and I called them on it.It was a neat experience, and I wouldnt change it.Obviously if you kill someone to eat them then the appropriate offence would be murder. There could be liability for unlawfully preventing a burial or outraging public decency if a desecrated body was publicly exposed or eaten in public.But we couldnt criminalise the eating of human flesh as most of us consume bits of our own bodies, like nibbling your own fingers for example.So although eating human flesh isnt strictly illegal, consenting cannibal arrangements can stray into dark territory.Samantha says: The law sets limits on what you can lawfully consent to. So, for example, you couldnt consent to someone chopping off your finger to consume it.In the UK you certainly couldnt consent to being killed to be eaten.Where we have seen cases of cannibalism in English law these have been charged as murder.In Gwens case, it all started because she had been thinking about how her friends would react if she really made a dish from her own bodily fluid - so last month she got online and ordered a set of needles and a blood bag.A couple of days and a few YouTube tutorials later, she punctured the skin on the inside of her elbow and started filling a bag with half a litre of her blood.Listening to the sounds of blood splashing into the bag, Gwen wondered: What would my mom think if she saw me sitting in my living room like this?Once she had extracted half a litre of her own blood from her now weak and purple-looking arm, she removed the needle - accidentally squirting a few droplets onto the carpet.Then, with the help of a close, not-too-squeamish friend, Gwen mixed lentils, tomato puree, soy sauce, and herbs into a filling and sloshed in almost the entire bag of blood.The kitchen looked like a slaughterhouse, she jokes in a Munchies article.Amazingly, many of Gwens friends were eager to try her creation, which she served up, MasterChef style, on white plates with a bloody jus.We cut happily into the sausages and chewed on them as if we were judges on a cooking show, she writes.The texture was very good and the level of spiciness was perfect. Unfortunately I went a bit heavy on the soy sauce, so the sausage is a bit salty. Not bad, though.However, not all would-be cannibals are so easily satisfied with just a bite of blood sausage.An alarming number of online posts feature requests for victims willing to be eaten alive to satisfy cannibalistic sexual desires.The forum which hosts hundreds of these posts is the evolution of Cannibal Cafe, a now-defunct website for cannibals seeking the same.Supposedly, the message board is for fetishists who want to role play as man-eaters, but we know from a high-profile case on Cannibal Cafe that some users were deadly serious about eating someone they met online.German IT technician Armin Meiwes was among the unknown number of legitimate cannibals lurking on the site.In the most notorious case of cannibalism this century, he posted: looking for a well-built 18 to 30-year-old to be slaughtered and then consumed.Bernd Jürgen Armando Brandes, an engineer from Berlin, answered his advert in March 2001, stating that he was willing to be killed and eaten.A few days later, the pair met in Meiwes home in the small town of Rotenburg and filmed a video where Meiwes cut off and ate Brandes penis, with his consent.As Brandes bled to death, Meiwes fried the penis in a pan with salt, pepper, wine and garlic.He later stabbed his victim the throat and hung his body on the meat hook.He ate the remains over the following ten months, hiding body parts in his freezer and eating up to 44 pounds of human flesh - all for the supposed sexual pleasure of it.The cannibal wasnt arrested until 2002, when another ad he posted online was brought to the attention of the authorities.Even though his victim had agreed to being killed and eaten, he was eventually convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.Today, Meiwes is a vegetarian and says he regrets his crime, but he estimates that there could still be as many as 800 active cannibals in Germany alone.As for the number of cannibals elsewhere, experts say its impossible to guess.But new posts pop up on the cannibal forum every day, and based on the chatter online it seems like the appetite for these dark and unconventional tastes is only growing.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But that’s where we have got it so wrong.It comes as no surprise that nearly 50 per cent of UK schools are failing to achieve the target 25 per cent of A-level entries in STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The nation is crying out for STEM skills. It is estimated there is a STEM-worker shortfall of 40,000 — and it is set to rise. We are facing a national crisis.Yet schools are rewarded on delivering grades, not different subjects. And this relentless focus on grades means youngsters are potentially being deprived access to high-paid and fast-growing careers.Research shows interest in maths and science dramatically declines during secondary school.When it comes to gender, there is a big difference. Interest in STEM subjects drops by 56 per cent among boys and 74 per cent among girls.Quite often girls underestimate their performance and, although they get better grades in maths and physics at GCSE, fewer of them take the subjects at A level than boys.There is this perception that you have to be a genius to do maths or science, but that is not true.Often teachers will say unless you get a grade A in maths or science at GCSE, don’t even bother taking it for A level. The reality is, even if you get a lower grade in the subject, it is still viewed very well by employers. Even if you take just one STEM subject, it will open up so many more doors.This is one of the reasons I created Future Finder, a free app to show young people the relationship between subject choices and their career pathway.After all, this is about preparing them for a job, not getting them to the top of the school system.Science is also fun, it is creative. It’s not dull and nerdy, which is how it is often perceived.We need to tell youngsters there are such jobs as autonomous vehicle engineers, gamification designers and carbon capture technicians, because you can’t be what you can’t see.Sixty-five per cent of children entering primary school now will end up working in jobs that don’t yet exist. And unless young people are learning the right skills, they’re not going to get them.Nearly 30 years ago, when I set up a data analysis company with my husband Clive, people threw data away because it was too expensive to keep. We went on to create Tesco Clubcard, the world’s first supermarket loyalty card.We were only a small business, but we had the skills to figure out something Tesco couldn’t on its own — exactly what its customers were buying.It revolutionised the way we shop, the supermarket doubled its market share within the year and we went from employing 30 staff to 1,500.We were at the forefront of a new science and it was an amazing time.I’m incredibly lucky and I’ve had a brilliant career. Now I want to help give back by preparing tomorrow’s talent.I was the chair of Your Life, a national campaign to encourage youngsters to consider careers in STEM.As a result of that movement, the Government now gives schools an additional £600 per pupil studying maths at A level.Figures also show that STEM subjects are becoming more popular. More than a third of all A-level entries in 2018 were in these subjects and more girls are taking STEM subjects.But we are already far behind countries such as America and China. That gap is only going to get wider too, as we estimate we will need 1.3million more science professionals by 2030.If schools are the talent factory then we need to deliver the skills the nation needs. We must start by giving extra weighting to maths and physics when it comes to measuring a school’s success.We are defined by the talent coming through our schools.

Quite the reverse.

Precious little.WHAT credibility can Labour’s promises over the freedom of the media possibly have when their single biggest financial backer is the odious Max Mosley?Leave aside that he is a former fascist who was present as his father Oswald’s thugs marched through a Jewish area of East London chanting “Jews out”.He now bankrolls Corbyn’s mob, to the tune of £300,000 last year alone, because he knows they will try to crush the popular Press given the chance.

We have got agreement on about 80 per cent of the issues.Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer claimed the release of todays technical notices was a sign of panic from ministers.He said: No Deal has never been a viable option. It has never been credible and I dont think the Prime Minister thinks it is a viable option.Dressing up the severe consequences as if that could be accepted or that could somehow be smoothed, is not to reassure anybody.And Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit select committee, complained that the documents dont provide an answer to the Irish border question.He said: There is still no clarity on how the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland will be avoided, and ministers have simply told businesses to seek advice from the Irish Government.This is an extraordinary abdication of responsibility.Business leaders welcomed the publication of more details - but warned ministers they must go further in reassuring Brits that No Deal would not lead to disaster.Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce said: Public preparations for all eventualities – and clear, crisp communication with affected businesses – are long past due.UK Finance boss Stephen Jones added: The Government is taking a pragmatic approach to addressing critical cliff-edge issues and to ensure consumers and businesses can continue accessing vital cross-border services.Anti-Brexit campaigners blasted the dossier, claiming it proves No Deal would devastate the UK.Labour MP Ben Bradshaw from the Peoples Vote campaign said: We are in this shambolic situation because the Government has utterly failed to come up with a proposal that is acceptable to either the EU or even their own party.They have made a catastrophic mess of this process from start to finish and that’s we’re looking down the barrel of a disastrous No Deal Brexit.David Davis, the previous Brexit Secretary, claimed he wanted to publish the No Deal notices as early as March -

Corbyn’s speech was full of cuddly sounding expressions.But the real message was clear: Never mind all that freedom nonsense — let’s nationalise the news.So, the Labour leader says he wants to invest taxes in public-interest journalism.Who would want journalism that goes against the public good?But the question is: Who decides what the public interest might mean?Government ministers? High court judges? Simon Cowell and Cheryl? Jeremy Corbyn’s press office?Look a little closer and it is clear there is no consensus on what qualifies as public-interest journalism.It is just an ethical-sounding excuse for imposing your own interests on what are really matters of personal taste and political preference.One thing seems certain: It will not be the British public deciding which sort of public-interest journalism taxes should finance.Corbyn wants his state-backed media fund to be “independent”.A buzzword that should raise the question: Independent of what?There are no independent angels floating above the grubby political battles below, with only the public interest at heart.Everybody has interests and agendas of their own.Labour’s independent media funding body would be another government-backed quango, stacked with placemen from the political and cultural elites.Corbyn had the nerve to protest that the media today is “unaccountable”.Yet his independent media board would be less accountable to the public than newspapers, which must respond to their readers who pay their hard-earned money for their newspaper of choice.As for taxes funding journalism to create a more informed public — informed by who, peddling which line?It is not hard to imagine the sort of information Corbyn wants the media to feed us, it would be like the old Russian Communist party paper Pravda.It is no coincidence that the Labour Party’s biggest individual donor last year was the odious, Press-hating Max Mosley.The Labour leader singled out something called the Bureau Of Investigative Journalism as an example of an independent outfit that should be given charitable status and tax perks.Would that be the same self-righteous bureau that prompted the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme to throw its ethics overboard a few years ago and falsely inform us that a Tory lord was a paedophile?Newsnight never recovered its reputation in the wake of the debacle.When Corbynites talk about wanting a more “diverse” media, one thing they do not mean is diversity of content and opinion. They want a conformist media that will report what it is told and not ask awkward questions.Even the BBC — bastion of the Remainstream media establishment — is too insolent for Labour’s tastes.If you want to see the real face of Labour’s attitude to journalism, just look at Corbyn’s smirking response to a Sky News reporter who asked him some straight questions about the recent wreath-laying controversy.His contemptuous reply basically said, “You have no right to know what I do or think” — in which case, neither do the mass of viewers.Labour’s track record gives the lie to any notion that it is interested in a more open media.The non-Corbynite deputy leader, Tom Watson, is an even more embittered Press-hater.Who does Jeremy Corbyn think he is, to be laying down the law on what a free Press should or should not investigate, and protesting to regulators when they report facts or express opinions not to his liking?Yet Corbyn’s quasi-Stalinist vision of State-approved journalism seems to go down well with his cultish fan club, who ensured that #ChangeTheMedia was trending on Twitter even before he spoke in Edinburgh.Perhaps they should more honestly have made it #ChangeTheMedia-OrElse.“Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or The Mail,” Corbyn claimed yesterday, “doesn’t automatically make it news.”If he had his way, it would be more a case of: “Just because it’s news, doesn’t automatically mean it should be allowed on the front page of The Sun.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Remainer sabotage? Or just another tone-deaf blunder?Either way, he left the Government looking even more chaotic than usual.Will No Deal happen? Consider this:Britain has offered “unconditional” security cooperation with the EU post-Brexit. In response, Brussels vows to CHARGE us to access its databases.They want capitulation, not a deal.JEREMY Corbyn’s sole motive in “changing the media” is to silence a hostile Press.The giveaway was when he attacked broadcasters yesterday for following up Sun stories. “Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or Mail doesn’t automatically make it news,” he whined.Could this be because recent front pages have exposed Labour’s racism? That IS news, as page one stories in the two biggest daily papers tend to be.Britain already has the world’s most vibrant media. Corbyn is feigning some high-minded interest in improving it. But the last thing he wants is it holding a future Labour Government to account.He detests scrutiny, as his tantrums sparked by tricky questions prove.As for his plan for a state-run Facebook rival, can you imagine anything more ridiculous or pointless?The ­Austin Allegro of social media, making ­gargantuan losses for taxpayers?And how about his “Netflix levy” to fund the BBC?Is there no limit to the costs he wants to pile on ordinary people?NOW, by contrast, is the time for the Tories to CUT taxes.There is depressing talk of a new hike to fund the NHS. But the public finances are in unexpectedly good shape, the deficit plummeting and growth on the up.Corporation tax should be as low as Ireland’s, stamp duty slashed to get the housing market moving, fuel duty lowered, and income tax cut too.With No Deal Brexit more likely, we need to boost the economy and lure investment with a low-tax regime as never before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

narrowly lost a vote against Turnbull.Under intense pressure to call a second vote, Turnbull convened a party meeting after receiving a letter signed by the majority of party members calling for a change of leader.Morrison defeated the key challenger Peter Dutton, a former Cabinet minister, by a vote 45-40.Turnbull said before the ballot that if he lost hed quit parliament, leaving the new government facing a by-election for his Sydney seat that could see it lose its one-seat majority.Australian media reported that foreign minister Bishop, having been defeated in the leadership ballot, would likely also resign from politics.Turnbull came to power in a party-room coup in September 2015.A social liberal and multi-millionaire former merchant banker, he has struggled to appeal to

got asked to join the next year.And that’s how he started his first marathon.“I struggled, but it was a nice atmosphere, everyone was encouraging, and when I’d finished, I’d done something I had never thought I would,” he said.25 years past, Brooks had run past snaked and been escorted by rangers with guns, looking out for polar bears.He had also won everything – from a sack of potatoes to a cowbell – for his efforts.Brooks is said to be the first person from the UK to complete marathons in all 50 states in America, as well as Washington D.C, plus  13 provinces and territories in Canada.His glorious record included 108 half marathons, 451 full marathons and 12 ultra marathon, that is any race longer than the traditional 26.2-mile-long marathon.451 marathonsMarathon PB: Three

His enthralling true story has now been made into the movie, BlacKkKlansman. But first director Spike Lee had to be convinced the tale was real.In events that seem too fanciful even for Hollywood, Ron became the first black member of the all-white KKK.Ron’s gripping memoir tells how he was even asked to LEAD the vile group’s Colorado Springs chapter, so convincing was his cover. The intelligence he gathered let cops stop bombings, stamp out the burning of crosses to intimidate black locals and also identify white supremacists in the military ready to prepare explosives and supply guns.Ron — played in the movie by John David Washington, son of Hollywood A-lister Denzel — recalls: “From an intelligence standpoint, we were successful. No cross-burnings in seven and a half months during this investigation.“They talked about bombing two gay bars — but they didn’t. We stopped two Klansmen whose job in the military was to deal with explosives from carrying out a threat to bomb. They talked about stealing automatic weapons from Fort Carson (army base) in preparation for a race war. We gained valuable intelligence.”For decades, the KKK waged a campaign of hate, violence and murder against non-whites. Ron was frequently on the receiving end of racist abuse.He was sworn in as a Colorado Springs police officer on his 21st birthday in 1974, and spent those first years honing his skills as an undercover cop, becoming their first black undercover narcotics detective.His infiltration of the KKK came about almost by chance. In 1978, while scanning the local papers for suspicious activity, Ron spotted a classified ad for a local KKK chapter. He answered using his real name, doubting he would hear back.Now 65 and retired, Ron says: “I told him I was a white man, that I hated blacks, Jews, Mexicans, Asians, that I thought the white man had not got a fair deal in this country. I signed my real name instead of my undercover name and mailed it off, thinking I would get a pamphlet, a brochure or something.”Two weeks later, the phone rang at Ron’s desk. To his amazement, it was a local KKK organiser.Shocked Ron reached for the most hate-filled response he thought would impress a Klan member.The delighted Klansman replied: “You are just the kind of guy we are looking for. When can we meet?”Ron says: “I had to formulate a plan real quick. I told him I couldn’t meet him now. We agreed to meet a week later.I started putting things in motion, getting a white officer to pose as me for this face-to-face meeting.”Ron scrambled to put together an official investigation, recruiting narcotics officer “Chuck” — not his real name — to play Ron in person. He would conduct most of the work over the phone, while Chuck went to secret Klan meetings. Star Wars’ Adam Driver plays a character similar to Chuck in the movie.Though their voices sounded very different, the investigation was never rumbled — despite one close call.Ron, who now lives in Utah, says: “The people I was dealing with were not, to use an old adage, the brightest bulbs in the socket. Only once in the entire seven months of the investigation was I ever challenged as to why my voice sounded different to Chuck’s.“Chuck had gone to a meeting I set up and later that day, as I thought about something said at that meeting, I got on the phone and called the local organiser. I started talking as if I’d been at the meeting.“But he said, ‘You sound different — what’s the matter?’ I coughed a couple of times and said I had a sinus infection. He said, ‘Oh, I get those all the time. Here’s what you need to do to take care of that’.”Ron even had conversations with “Grand Wizard” David Duke — a former Klan boss and one of America’s most reviled racists.Ron came across a phone number for “the Voice of the Klan” and Duke, played in the movie by Topher Grace, picked up on the other end.Ron says: “He laughed and said, ‘I’m the Voice of the Klan’. He identified himself as the Grand Wizard, the director. I told him I was a new Colorado Springs chapter member and was honoured to speak with him.“He was very much like Donald Trump in that he liked to be fawned over. He liked flattery. I played that game and flattered him a lot.”During their conversations, Duke, now 68, had no idea he was talking to a black man. He found out for the first time a decade ago. Ron even describes Duke — a white supremacist and Holocaust denier — as being pleasant to talk to when he wasn’t discussing race.Ron says: “Inevitably, race would come up. Dr Jekyll turned into Mr Hyde and the monster in him came out. He said vile things about racial groups and people of colour, ethnicities and people, as they put it, who were not ‘pure Aryan white’.”The racism Ron fought has not gone away Ron cheekily asked Duke if he ever worried about talking to black men over the phone without realising.The clueless Duke told Ron he could tell if callers “weren’t pure Aryan white” by the way they pronounced “certain words and phrases”. The remark had Ron “cracking up laughing”.In another twist, Ron was asked in his role as police officer to guard Duke at a rally in Colorado. Duke never recognised the man he had been speaking to on the phone.Ron even had a Polaroid photo taken with Duke, throwing his arms around the Klan leader. Behind the camera was Chuck, the cop who played his white alter ego.Ron says: “Duke ran to get (the photo) out of my hand. I told him, ‘If you touch me, I will arrest you for assault of a police officer. That is worth about five years in prison. Don’t do it’. He stood there dumbfounded.”Sadly, the picture was lost as Ron moved house 40 years ago.His undercover operation was brought to a close in March 1979, after the local organiser of the Colorado Springs Klan asked Ron to take over as LEADER. Instead, he was ordered by the police chief to shut down the investigation and cease all contact with the group.Ron says: “The chief made it clear he wanted ‘Ron Stallworth, Klansman’ to completely disappear.”No arrests were made during the sting. Ron says: “That was always a bone of contention around law enforcement circles — and among people like David Duke, who try to downplay it. Nobody was arrested for a criminal offence.”But, Ron insists, the investigation WAS a success. When he got a tip that a cross-burning was about to happen, the police would send cars to prevent it.When the operation was wound up, Ron’s boss ordered him to destroy all evidence of the investigation.But he took home some files — including his Klan membership card with his name on it. After his operation ended, Ron spent time as a narcotics investigator and on special assignment with the Colorado Attorney General’s organised-crime strikeforce. He retired in 2005, writing his memoir in 2014.Spike Lee’s film opened here yesterday, a year on from the death of Heather Heyer, 32. She was killed in Charlottesville, Virginia, when a white nationalist driver ploughed his car into a crowd of people protesting against a far-right rally.Footage of that is included in the film, underlining that the racism Ron fought against has not gone away.Ron says: “Spike Lee has done a masterful job making this movie.”Predictably, a lonely dissenting voice is that of duped David Duke. The bitter racist tweeted: “This whole KKK film is a big lie.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet, we can’t help but feeling we are looking at a cover-up.“It’s been over nine months since Carl’s death and we’re no further forward in getting answers… I owe it to Carl to get the full picture.”Now a Sun investigation has established that the allegations involve two “incredibly mild” incidents of inappropriate touching, and a more serious allegation which was “recycled” - having initially been dealt with a year and a half earlier.On one occasion, he supposedly put his arm around an activist in a bar at a political event the summer before his death.It was apparently months before this was reported to the Welsh Labour Party.Another allegation seems to have involved him touching another woman’s knee.We have been told that the third allegation against Mr Sargeant was “recycled”.It was an old claim first made in 2016 by a Labour Party employee who apparently said Mr Sargeant once ‘twanged’ her bra strap.No action was ever taken against him.But this complaint was re-heated and resubmitted days before his death in 2017.The reason this is important is because a Labour Party member must make a complaint to trigger a party investigation.A Welsh Labour Party source, who does not want to be named, told The Sun: “This historic complaint was resurrected because - unlike the other two complaints - it was made by a Labour Party member.“Someone, it’s not clear who, went back to the Labour Party member who made this complaint in 2016 and asked her to resubmit it as if it were new.”The tragedy unfolded in Downing Street on Monday, October 30, 2017, when the so-called ‘Sexminster’ scandal was gaining momentum.That day, Wales’ First Minister and its Labour Party leader Carwyn Jones visited Theresa May in Number 10.He then told the media he had never received a “direct allegation” about sexual harassment involving a Welsh Assembly Member.Yet strangely, over the next few days several insiders, including a BBC reporter, received text messages tipping them off that Sargeant was about to lose his job in a forthcoming reshuffle - meaning they knew his fate before he did.On Friday November 3, Sargeant was told by Carwyn Jones vague details about the harassment allegations and abruptly dismissed.The decision to fire him from government was made after one of Jones’s senior Welsh Assembly aides, Matt Greenough, who is paid from the public purse, had talked to his accusers.It’s not known what, if any, official notes were taken of these conversations or where they took place.All of this happened sometime between Monday afternoon and Friday morning.The matter was then handed over to Labour, becoming a party issue.At no stage were the police involved.Oct 30, 2017: First Minister Carwyn Jones tells media he had never received a “direct allegation” about sexual harassment involving a Welsh Assembly member.Early Nov: Allegations of sexual harassment made against Sargeant. The 2016 “bra twang” allegation is said to have been resubmitted.Nov 2: Presiding Officer Elin Jones orders a review into how complaints of sexual harassment are dealt with by the Assembly.Nov 3: Sargeant sacked as Secretary for Communities and Children and suspended from the Labour Party pending an inquiry.Nov 6: Carwyn Jones tells media he’d become “aware of a number of incidents at the beginning of last week” involving Sargeant.Nov 7: Sargeant found dead at his home in Flintshire.Nov 10: First Minister orders an inquiry into how he handled Sargeant’s sacking.Nov 13: Inquest opens and a provisional cause of death is given as hanging.Nov 23: First Minister refers himself to independent inquiry to examine whether he breached the ministerial code over a 2014 claim there had been no complaints about bullying in his government.This was a cruel blow for the well-liked Sargeant, who rose from a job at a chemical plant to first representing his beloved Labour Party in the Cardiff parliament in 2003.A friend told us: “Carl was an authentic working class politician, which is very rare in politics these days. He was very popular among the grass roots of the Labour Party.”On Monday November 6, Carwyn Jones told the BBC he had become “aware of a number of incidents at the beginning of last week” involving Sargeant.He said: “I asked my office to speak to those women involved who had provided detail of those incidents. As a result of those conversations I felt I had no choice but to refer the matter to the party.”Note that Jones did not use the term “alleged incidents”, ADD “seemingly” suggesting Sargeant’s guilt had already been established when it certainly had not.Sargeant’s lawyers immediately wrote to the Labour Party describing Jones’s comments as “clearly prejudicing what is allegedly an independent inquiry” by the Labour disputes office.The letter made clear his “anxiety”.This was pertinent given he was reportedly on anti-depressants.And it raised the “very real possibility that the evidence of the witnesses is being manipulated.”The next morning, November 7, Sargeant was found dead at home on the Flintshire council estate where he grew up.But why would anyone have it in for Sargeant?The answer: dirty politics.Sargeant - the popular voice of the people in Welsh Labour - was considered a strong contender to be the next leader.This apparently worried supporters of the altogether more middle class would-be candidate, Vaughan Gething.Leighton Andrews, a former minister in Welsh Labour, has spoken of a “toxic culture” in the party and accused Jones of presiding over “minor bullying, mind games, power games, favouritism, inconsistency of treatment to different ministers, deliberate personal undermining on occasion”.“Carl was unquestionably the target of some of this behaviour,” Andrews wrote recently.“The relentless drip-drip of disinformation — and worse — had a strain on his and others’ mental health. The First Minister was made aware of this by several ministers, including myself. Nothing was done.”Sargeant was apparently considered the biggest threat to Gething.A friend of Sargeant said: “It does look like this was all orchestrated because a group of people wanted Carl out of government. They took advantage of the whole Sexminster frenzy in Westminster and said ‘Right, what have we got on Carl, how can we sack him? We need a reason to sack him.’ So they concocted it.”All this might go some way to explaining the latest twist in this saga.This week Bernie Sargeant and her son Jack, who successfully stood for election in his father’s Assembly seat of Alyn and Deeside in February, announced they are seeking a judicial review into how the independent inquiry into the death will be run.The inquiry, led by Paul Bowen QC, was announced by Carwyn Jones within days of Sargeant’s death.Its remit is to investigate how Sargeant was treated by the First Minister.Not only has it still not begun, triggering the cover-up claims, The Sargeant family believe they will not be allowed to attend the inquiry and their legal team will not get the chance to cross-examine witnesses, including Carwyn Jones.One friend commented: “First there was a stitch-up, now we’re seeing an attempted cover-up.”The Labour Party refused to comment.Carwyn Jones refused to comment.GOT a story?

This suggests that Hackney have made an error, which they now realise.Mr Ahmed received his first fine on June 18 but claims he wasnt notified of the fine until one month later.In the meantime he had committed another eleven offences.“The penalty charge notices have made me very upset, annoyed, angry, frustrated and stressed, he told the MailOnline.“Theyve also given me insomnia and Ive suffered huge financial loss.Between 7am-10am and 3pm-7pm drivers cannot turn left from Mare Street onto Richmond Road to reduce pollution at a nearby school.But drivers have complained poor signage and a lack of warning about the new restrictions have unfairly hit them in the pockets.The council has already dished out more than 14,000 fines since the restrictions were introduced in June, the Hackney Gazette reports.The fine is £65 if paid within two weeks and doubles after that - with drivers told they could face court action if they fail to pay within a month.RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: The number of fines being given to drivers at this junction suggests something is wrong - and it might well be that the sheer amount of signage and a difficult road layout is to blame.The sign is immediately past a busy pedestrian crossing and between two sections of bus lane on Mare Street.A driver would have just moments to read all the traffic signs and decide whether they were permitted to turn left.And unlike on a straight section of road, they would have no opportunity to correct the manoeuvre if they then realised their mistake.A review of all the street signage around the junction would also be very welcome.The fines have sparked outrage among drivers on social media.Writing on Twitter, Trajon2000 said: Councillors will be giving themselves a big pat on the back for that, oh and a big payrise.Just a thought here, if they put more of these signs around the borough to catch people out, could we have a council tax reduction please.A Council spokesperson said: “The changes to this junction are part of our pioneering school streets initiative which is improving air quality and making it easier and safer for families to walk and cycle to and from school.“The notices already meet all Department for Transport requirements, and we have now added additional signage to ensure all drivers comply and help make our children’s school journeys healthier.“While it is the responsibility of drivers to read this signage and adhere to the road closures, we will of course listen to representations where a driver feels that a fine has been issued unfairly or received multiple fines during a short period.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000428677143.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may urged to sack philip hammond after his  on a no deal brexit","story":"Furious Tory MPs called on the PM to replace the doom-monger Chancellor with Sajid Javid.The fresh anger against Mr Hammond comes after he published a letter warning of “large fiscal consequences” of leaving the EU without a deal on the same day as Brexit chief Dominic Raab’s presented the positives of no deal.Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith compared the Chancellor’s constant Brexit doom to Mr Ratner, the former millionaire whose jewellery chain collapsed after famously describing his products as “total crap”.He told The Sun: “Any business will tell you if you’re in a position of authority and you spend your whole time telling everybody how rotten things are, then you will deliver a rotten outcome.“So Philip Hammond has become the Gerald Ratner of politics because he has no faith in his country or in his country’s businesses or the people who live in his country and all he can see around him is disaster.”Tory MP Nadine Dorries went a step further - calling on the PM to sack Mr Hammond.She fumed: “Philip Hammond has to go - he’s like a ball and chain around the Prime Minister’s leg and he’s a ball and chain on Brexit.“Everything Philip Hammond does is to prevent or stop Brexit.But this Chancellor has shown none of the energy, optimism or vision that job needs as we leave the EU. He has been engulfed by Treasury defeatism.Other Cabinet figures know that post-Brexit we will have the economic tools to thrive. If Mr Hammond wants to show he understands that too, and keep his job after next March, he should draw up a tax-cutting Budget now.Not just moan that the sky is falling in.“We need an upbeat, outward looking, asporicational chancellor who wants to embrace Brexit and all it has to offer, not someone who is permanently trying to stop it.“I think Sajid Javid would be a great Chancellor - I think he’s born to be Chancellor.”Another senior Tory said: “There isn’t a single person now in politics who in any way can understand why he’s still there because he’s undermined the Prime Minister on every single turn.“Everyone is astonished that he still exists, he still stays in that position and he seems to be taking a completely different line from her on every given occasion.”No10 also laid bare its frustration at Mr Hammond’s failure to get clearance from the Prime Minister before publishing the letter.A Downing Street source dismissed the analysis as “preliminary and very much a work in progress,” adding: “As we have always said, Britain will ultimately succeed, no matter what our particular relationship is with the EU.”But the PM’s deputy David Lidington defended the Chancellor’s divisive intervention.Mr Lidington claimed Mr Hammond was only trying to be punctual in replying to MPs.And he insisted it was a coincidence that the Chancellor’s letter - which warned a no deal Brexit could wipe ten per cent off Britain’s national income - was sent on the same day as Mr Raab’s long-awaited presentation of Britain’s contingency planning designed to kill off “scare stories”.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And only 18 per cent of people wear ear defenders when using power tools at home.Those aged 55 and over are least likely to wear them, a poll of 2,000 adults by the British Standards Institution found.People said they did not think they are necessary, were too lazy to buy them or thought they were too expensive.A pair of quality-approved ear defenders cost upwards of £16. Health and safety rules say employers must protect workers from extended exposure to volumes above 85dB.Anne Scorey, from the BSI, said: “It’s worrying to see that so many Brits are exposing themselves to unsafe levels of noise.It’s down to a widespread misunderstanding around hearing safety, to the extent that some in the survey even believed that listening to music through headphones will negate any risk.We’d urge people to keep an eye out for ear defenders that carry the BSI Kitemark before they start their DIY tasks this weekend.”And Vaitheki Maheswaran, from Action on Hearing Loss, said: Quality ear defenders are an excellent and affordable way to protect your hearing.But Jo Behari, author of The Girls Guide to DIY, said: This is health and safety gone mad.People dont need to dress up like they are doing a day shift on an industrial site just for an odd-job around the house.Guidance like this is likely to put people off doing DIY and adds unnecessary expense.People should not be unnecessarily worried if they are putting up shelves without earmuffs this weekend.The Sun told last year how safety experts wanted kids to wear ear defenders when popping balloons at parties.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their research used GPS measurements over 11 years between 2001 and 2012.Writing in the report Dr Murray and his team said this strong geological evidence of sliding have a natural tendency to result in large catastrophic sector collapse and devastating consequences such as landslides.The data suggests the mountain is moving in an east-south-east direction, down a gentle slope of 1-3 degrees towards the coastal town of Giarre, which is about 15km away.The movement has been put down to underlying platform of weak, pliable sediments.Dr Murray stressed it could take thousands of years to develop to a critical stage.He told the BBC: The 14mm/yr is an average it varies from year to year. The thing to watch I guess is if in 10 years time the rate of movement has doubled - that would be a warning. If its halved, Id say there really is nothing to worry about.Etna erupted in March 2017 injuring eight people covering them with steam and burning boulders.Its most destructive eruption took place in March 1669 and produced lava flows that destroyed at least 10 villages on its southern flank."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000428750377.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"m6 closed j10 bank holiday travel roads","story":"Highways England said southbound traffic is affected between J11 and J10A in Staffordshire while northbound junctions eight to 10 are disrupted.Traffic northbound is reportedly at a standstill.Along with travellers getting set for a long weekend rugby league fans are making their way to Wembley to see the Catalan Dragons take on Warrington in the Challenge Cup Final.Football fans are also making their way to Wolverhampton as Wolves host Manchester City at Molineux later today.Widespread travel disruption is expected today on many routes.The M1 is expected to be badly affected today from junctions 22 to 25 in the East Midlands with journey times likely to be increased by one hour.M5M20M1M4Weather forecasters have also warned of difficult driving conditions over the weekend.Simon Partridge from the Met Office said: In places we are quite likely to see some standing water on the roads which will add to the difficult driving conditions on Sunday."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000428797515-e1535199705524.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pope francis ireland first papal visit 40 years","story":"In the first papal visit to the country in almost 40 years, Pope Francis landed 10.26am on a direct flight from Rome.He is due to hold mass tomorrow with half a MILLION pilgrims expected to attend.But speaking first alongside Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar this afternoon, Francis said that public outrage against the failures of the church to protect children in its care was justified.In extraordinary comments addressing the scale of clerical sex abuse in Ireland, the pontiff said people were right to be angry at church figures over the repellent crimes inflicted on young people.He told an audience at Dublin Castle: With regard to the most vulnerable, I cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal caused in Ireland by the abuse of young people by members of the Church charged with responsibility for their protection and education.He added: The failure of ecclesiastical authorities - bishops, religious superiors, priests and others - adequately to address these repellent crimes has rightly given rise to outrage and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community.I myself share those sentiments.But Francis said that the church now has a responsibility to make amends by redoubling efforts to provide care for the most vulnerable in society.He added: It is my hope that the gravity of the abuse scandals, which have cast light on the failings of many, will serve to emphasise the importance of the protection of minors and vulnerable adults on the part of society as a whole, he added.In this regard, all of us are aware of how urgent it is to provide our young people with wise guidance and sound values on their journey to maturity.The Pope said he also wished to acknowledge women who in the past had endured particularly difficult circumstances.On Northern Ireland, he praised those who helped forged the historic Good Friday Agreement in 1998.And he referenced the political deadlock in Northern Ireland, which has seen the region without a properly functioning devolved government for 20 months.Francis said: We can give thanks for the two decades of peace that followed this historic agreement, while expressing firm hope that the peace process will overcome every remaining obstacle and help give birth to a future of harmony, reconciliation and mutual trust.The speech came after a private meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, at which the Irish premier urged the Pope to listen to the victims.Earlier, he met Irish President Michael D Higgins at his official residence in Phoenix Park.Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to welcome Pope Francis during his whistle-stop tour of the capital city and Co Mayo over the weekend.The Pontiff will witness a country that has undergone seismic social changes in the four decades since the last papal visit in 1979, when John Paul II was lauded by a nation shaped by its relationship with an all-powerful Catholic Church.Senior Irish clerics and other dignitaries gathered on the apron of the runway to greet the Pope clapped as the Alitalia flight landed.Irish and Vatican flags were flown from the cockpit windows as the aircraft taxied toward its stand.Pope Francis emerged from the plane soon after, walking down the steps to be greeted on a red carpet by Irelands deputy premier and foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney.He was with his wife Ruth and their three daughters Jessica, Beth and Annalise. The children greeted him in Irish, English and Spanish.One of the girls then presented the Pope with a bouquet of flowers. The bouquet included thistles, yellow and white roses and green foliage.Francis is likely to receive a warm reception from the thousands of pilgrims who have travelled to be part of the occasion.However, he will also be met by protesters angry at how the church dealt with multiple clerical sex abuse scandals that have damaged trust in the religious institution and seriously weakened its influence on Irish society.Mr Coveney acknowledged that many people had mixed feelings about the visit.He said: I think its been difficult for many people, for victims, for Catholics and many of the clergy.But I hope and expect that this weekend will be a very powerful moment. He has a personality that can reach out to Irish people.At some point over the weekend, the Pope will meet a number of abuse victims in a private meeting amid expectation he will use his public utterances elsewhere to confront the emotive issue.The Pope was driven from the airport for a meeting with the Irish President at his residence in Dublins Phoenix Park.Francis was greeted by Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina at their home at Aras an Uachtarain.The Irish greeting party also included Irish government minister for children and youth affairs Katherine Zappone.An Irish Army band played the national anthems of Vatican City and Ireland during the arrival ceremony.Moving inside the property, the pontiff signed the visitors book before entering into a private meeting with Mr Higgins, which took place ahead of a tree planting ceremony.Earlier this week, the Pope wrote a 2,000-word letter to Catholics in which he condemned the crime of sexual abuse by priests and subsequent cover-ups.He demanded accountability in response to fresh revelations in Pennsylvania in the United States of decades of misconduct by clerics.Francis is ostensibly in Ireland to attend the World Meeting of Families (WMOF) - a major global church event focused on promoting family values.However, he will also fulfil a number of other engagements.With Ireland in the midst of a high-profile homelessness problem, the Pope will meet a number of impacted individuals and families at a centre run by a religious order.Tens of thousands of people are expected to line the streets of Dublin city centre on Saturday afternoon as he passes through in his famous Popemobile.In the evening he will join 80,000 pilgrims at a musical festival in the landmark Croke Park Gaelic Athletic Association stadium.On Sunday the Pope will fly west to Co Mayo where he will follow in the footsteps of John Paul II and take part in a religious service at a Holy shrine.He will then return to Dublin for the closing centrepiece of the WMOF event - an outdoor Mass in front of an expected congregation of half a million people."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000001337089.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"african swine fever europe chinese pig farms","story":"The virus has contaminated a farm in Romania containing 135,000 pigs - with officials blaming water taken from the Danube river for its spread.Gicu Dragan, from the Bucharest Diagnostic and Animal Health Institute, told local media thousands of pigs would now be culled.He said: The Bucharest Diagnostic and Animal Health Institute confirmed the existence of the African swine fever virus at TEBU Consult, the second largest farm in Europe where there are 135,000.I sent the samples to the national reference laboratory on Friday morning and the results confirmed the existence of the virus, and on Monday we will go to the euthanasia of the pigs on this farm.I think the animals are affected by the Danube water, and the farms are supplied with water from the Danube.The disease is transmitted by ticks and direct contact between animals, and can also travel via contaminated food, animal feed and people moving from one place to another. There is no vaccine, but it is not harmful to humans.Meanwhile, the strain that has struck China is similar to the one that has spread across Russia, Georgia and Estonia over the past decade, a senior veterinarian at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says.The virus which causes African swine fever is hardy and has been shown to remain infectious for at least 30 days in uninhabited pig pens, over four months in pork products, including salted dried hams, and indefinitely in frozen pig carcasses.The Swine Health Information Center said: The hardiness of this virus, along with the fact it is found throughout the pig as well as its faeces and saliva, means these leaps of the disease across large distances are possible.Authorities in the eastern province of Zhejiang said they would slaughter 1,332 hogs and seal off an area within 1.8miles from the pig farming community in the city of Yueqing, where the outbreak was discovered.The local government said in a statement that it had also banned the movement of animals that could be easily infected inside and outside the affected area, and closed some live hog trading markets and slaughterhouses following the outbreak.The latest cull will bring the total number of pigs deliberately killed to prevent he spread of the highly contagious disease to over 25,000.The discovery and two other cases reported in Henan in central China and Jiangsu province to the north of Zhejiang are thousands of kilometres away from the first outbreak."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1536/skynews-brexit-eu-no-deal-dominic-raab_4398676.jpg?20180823130237 ","title":"corbyn reported to mp standards watchdog over zionist comment","story":"He discussed a speech by the then Palestinian ambassador, Manuel Hassassian, which he says was recorded by \"thankfully silent Zionists\" who then approached the speaker and \"berated\" him.Referring to the \"Zionists\" he says: \"There are two problems, one is they don\u0027t want to study history, and the second is, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don\u0027t understand English irony either.\"Zionism is the support for the creation of a Jewish homeland in the state of Israel.

Can you hear me at the back? My name is Dominic Raab and I am your stewardess on this flight with Brexit Airways. As you will have been aware at the time you bought your tickets, or in the case of 48% of you were marched at gunpoint on to the plane, our original destination was the Sunlit Uplands of 1974, where we could once again enjoy a 3-day week, a state of emergency in Northern Ireland, and fascists marching in the streets.  Due to unforeseen circumstances entirely within our control but sadly not explained in the literature available to you on the clown bus that drove you to the airport, our pilot Theresa has had to alter our destination. She thinks we\u0027re headed for the Great Famine of 1845, but her co-pilot Philip thinks it\u0027s more likely to be the 1931 financial dustbowl.  Meanwhile Jacob, who some of you may remember from when he used to sit at the back of the plane, has somehow got into the cockpit and having assumed the role of navigator is quoting the Book of Proverbs, and trying to get us all on the right heading for the Glorious Revolution of 1688, by taking us first to the Black Death of 1348 which he believes we would all appreciate a glimpse of. I am aware that in the two hours we\u0027ve been on this plane, which have seemed more like years to many of us, concern has grown among passengers about what exactly will happen when we land and so I have been asked to issue you with instructions about what to do if it turns out the runway we are heading for does not, in fact, exist. Now, I don\u0027t want you to worry, but in the 5 minutes - is that all? Feels like a month - since I was put in charge of the cabin crew I have looked all over the plane and not been able to find any emergency exits. I was wondering if I could ask you now to look around and let me know if you can see any possible escape routes. Just wave at me if you can.    Oh I\u0027m sorry, I forgot your hands were tied. Well, I do have some good news in that a 100% organic meal will be served, just as soon as it is licensed by the airport we are leaving and got through, uh, about 9 months of red tape. On the plus side it will be very cheap as there is a limited market for well-rotted swede, even if swallowing it seems a high price to pay.  On the subject of payment, I\u0027m aware most of you use credit cards to make purchases abroad and there may be higher charges for doing so, depending on where we land exactly, and indeed whether money still forms part of our society at that time. Our stewards are now passing round a hat into which you are all encouraged to put your loose change, house deeds, flexible friends and first-born child if you have one, or somebody else\u0027s if you don\u0027t. Please don\u0027t be alarmed if you have less to put in the hat than your neighbour, because we do have complimentary sandwiches on board and you will still be able to enjoy a BLT once we have landed, and although it might be a little damp and curly by then I can put to rest right now the rumour that we will be asking Her Majesty\u0027s Armed Forces to feed them to you.  All service personnel will instead be asked to stand by the cabin door to deal with 7 times the current volume of border checks on people, services and goods, because we do not have nearly enough customs officials and while we could just wave you all off down the stairs, or inflatable ramp depending on what happens, we think there could be hostile customs officials at our destination who will make things worse if we don\u0027t.    I\u0027ve also been authorised to tell you that we will be recruiting 9,000 extra air traffic controllers to organise our landing , and although we will be running out of fuel in 35 minutes or so I can assure you that will feel more like 7 months, so plenty of time to enjoy the company of loved ones before the rule of law enters a period where we don\u0027t know whose law it will be.  As we have left the European Aviation Safety Agency - I know we all assumed we\u0027d find a way to stay in this, I know I did, but it seems that your previous stewardess David didn\u0027t get the paperwork done before he jumped - the plane and indeed the pilot are no longer insured, which is actually good news as it should bring down the overall cost of any flights you decide to take, if you manage to survive this one. Er, hello sir? Are you wiggling your eyebrows and making those strangled noises to get my attention? Yes, yes, ah right, I understand. For those of you who didn\u0027t hear, this gentleman in the fourth row has indicated that all this is giving him a headache and he\u0027s wondering if there is any aspirin aboard. A few of you may be in a similar situation, particularly in Blairite class where there\u0027s been some headbutting. We carry six aspirin at all times, and aware of a possible delay in supplies we have ordered an extra six aspirin to be stockpiled. These will be brought onto the plane as soon as we make physical contact with the ground, and I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll go a long way towards alleviating the painful injuries some of us may sustain during that process.  Now, I\u0027ve saved the best news til last which is that I have managed to find a parachute in the shape of the World Trade Organisation. It has a simple set of rules which, once we\u0027ve dusted them off, will mean more complicated rules on pretty much everything, more paperwork, more laws for things like credit ratings agencies, and so many rules for stuff like paediatric medicine that actually we\u0027re planning to ignore those completely and just give sick children whatever the hell we can find.  WHOAH! Just a bit of turbulence there, I believe the fact that Boris, our trainee pilot, ran screaming from the cockpit, down the aisle and hauled up a floor panel to interfere with the landing gear just shifted some weight around, but we\u0027ve steadied now. As I was about to say, we have this great parachute, although it turns out that it renders individual trade deals impossible, it requires the building of a brick wall covered in barbed wire in Northern Ireland, and in fact the WTO hasn\u0027t actually agreed we can use it so I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m even mentioning it.  You should really stop weeping, and try to be more like Mr Corbyn here who is calmly suggesting alterations to the in-flight magazine, and who despite sitting nearest to the cockpit is making no effort at all to seize control of it.  Oh, and I forgot to say, but those of you who are British ex-pats may not be able to access your bank accounts after we land. Anyone who needs the services of a sperm donor will find that a lot more difficult too. On this last count, I understand Boris has offered to masturbate for free if the Daily  will report on it.

Deputy leader Tom Watson will call for a new regulator and tougher sanctions to police the “wild west” of the internet. He accuses the companies of not removing fake news stories that are “spread\u0026shying like wildfire”, and being too lax on harassment and bullying. Mr Watson will say Britain should follow the lead of Germany, which fines social media firms up to \u0026pound45million for not taking down hate speech within 24 hours.  He thinks No10 is dragging its feet and the UK should consider creating a commissioner to hold tech firms responsible for abuse on their sites. Mr Watson will say the likes of Facebook and Twitter have refused to change, adding: “Authorities worldwide don’t have the baby teeth, let alone the sharp teeth, to make them take notice. International regulatory regimes are outdated and dangerous.” Responsibility for overseeing social media here is shared by Ofcom, the Advertising Standards Authority and the Information Commissioner’s Office.

But wait, it\u0027s not over yet, we\u0027ve got one last bank holiday to go and it\u0027s really worth being prepared for it. By this point, we\u0027ve all had enough of cowering from the heatwave sun so the end-of-summer cooldown is most welcome. That means it’s the ideal time to get out and enjoy some activities. Below we\u0027ve pulled together some great ideas for making the most out of the last bank holiday before Christmas... Get out on a family cycling adventure  If you\u0027ve been putting off taking the kids out to practise cycling, this last bank holiday is the ideal time to get out for a ride. Head out to some quiet woodland, or check out the Halfords widget below to find your nearest cycling route.   If you want to head further afield, then don\u0027t forget that it\u0027s easy enough to add a bike rack to your car.  The Thule ProRide 591 Roof Mount Bike Carrier (above) is \u0026pound75 (save \u0026pound35) and useful because you can add more than one to a roof rack - making it perfect for growing families. Halfords also sell a wide range of roof racks - and will fit them for you too. Enjoy a camping trip to Scotland  One of the great things about Scotland - aside from the stunning countryside - is freedom to roam. It means camping is allowed on public, unenclosed, land for no more than two or three nights. Your other option is to visit one of the many existing campsites across the country, such as at Loch Lomond (try Ardlui), Loch Ness (consider Borlum), or one of the many along the coast (check out Clachtoll Beach Campsite at Sutherland).  For camping, we suggest the Halfords 4 Person Double Skin Tent (above) which is now just \u0026pound40, save \u0026pound60, and takes just 15 minutes to pitch. If you\u0027re driving with all your camping gear, you\u0027ll also want to consider boot space.  It\u0027s surprising how much stuff you need to take the kids away for a couple of nights and you don\u0027t want to be uncomfortable in the car.  For added space, grab the Exodus 470L Black Roof Box Fully Fitted Bundle (above) from Halfords. It\u0027s \u0026pound389 (save \u0026pound98) and includes the fitting and a roof rack suitable for your car. Find the perfect spot for a picnic  Take a picnic out with you and you\u0027ll have everything you need for a great day out. You could even pack the Halfords Portable Gas Stove (below), which is now \u0026pound8 (save \u0026pound12). But don\u0027t forget to pick up the correct Campingaz CP250 (A4) Gas Cartridge to go with it - these are just \u0026pound2 each or four for \u0026pound5.  Just make sure you\u0027re allowed to cook at your destination – many beaches only allow barbeques and small stoves after most people have gone home. It\u0027s well worth checking with the local council if you\u0027re not sure. Go on a great road trip!  A day trip or staycation break by road could be perfect for your family. Avoid queues by bagging a handy sat nav - which will also keep you on route and give you a pretty reliable answer to the \u0027are we there yet?\u0027 question. The Garmin Drive Sat Nav (below) - priced \u0026pound89.99 (save \u0026pound10) comes with lifetime map updates so you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road.  Also be sure to check your car is in good shape before heading out as there\u0027s nothing worse than planning a great bank holiday trip only to be thwarted by vehicle trouble. There are some simple things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, how is your car battery doing? Telltale signs that something is wrong include trouble starting the engine and lights that are dim when the engine isn\u0027t running - simple enough to check when you\u0027re parked up. Also, be wary that the hot summer months have a big impact on your car battery.

Her mum Julia is there teaching her big brother John to play her banjo with its mother-of-pearl back, or John is  practising the guitar with his mates Paul and George in the kitchen as she and her sister Jackie jig about.   Her brother – a half-brother – was of course Beatles legend John Lennon .  That is breathtakingly clear when you see Julia’s face, with the same slim nose and pointed chin, now lined, giving a glimpse, spellbinding and heartbreaking, of how he might have looked today.   Her visits to that house in Allerton’s Springwood estate in Liverpool are bittersweet. Her mum and brother are long gone – Julia killed in a car accident in 1958 and John assassinated by Mark Chapman in New York in December 1980. Chapman was this week refused freedom at his 10th parole hearing.  Julia prefers not to talk about him. Even speaking of John’s death is still acutely painful for her. It could also hurt that John’s legacy is everywhere but the former teacher explains she has found embracing it is better than running away. “There is no escape,” she says. “And there is no point in pretending. It would hurt more to pretend I had nothing to do with him.”   What helps is the memory of those joyous early years before tragedy struck, the time when a teenage John first met Paul McCartney and George Harrison and invited them to join his band The Quarrymen.  It is 60 years since they made their first record with Percy Phillips’ Sound Recording Services. It was a rendition of Buddy Holly’s That’ll Be The Day and an original, In Spite of All The Danger. Two years later they became The Beatles. The record features in The Percy Phillips Studio Collection, which Julia will help launch tomorrow at the Beatles Convention in Liverpool.   Julia has taken on a directorship at the Cavern Club, where The Beatles played in their early years, but admits she never got to see them play there.  “We weren’t allowed at the Cavern. I was 14, but looked like a 10-year-old, and the bus home only went to Penny Lane after 9.20pm. Woe betide you if you missed it because you had to walk a few miles.”  But in 1964 she and sister Jackie went to see The Beatles at the Finsbury Park Astoria in London. Julia says: “The curtain went up and it was instant mayhem, I hated it. “They all rushed to the front and John is doing I Love You and he’s going, ‘Get the girls’. We were hauled on our stomachs back to the curtains. But I saw them in the kitchen often enough. And at home in our kitchen, where John was truly himself. “That kitchen is where it all happened.”  From the age of five, John had actually lived with his strict Aunt Mimi, his mother Julia’s sister. His mum had split from his dad, merchant seaman Alfred Lennon, who rarely returned from sea and was living with Bobby Dykins with whom she had her two daughters Julia and Jackie. John went to live with Mimi because, Julia says, she disapproved of her mother’s unmarried life with Bobby. But John always visited and was close to his younger sisters. Julia, 71, almost snaps when asked if he was different from other lads. She wants to stress their normality. “He was no different from any older brother on the road,” she says.  Sitting in Liverpool’s Hard Day’s Night Hotel, her brother’s voice on loop, she recalls the day of the church fete in Woolton in 1957 where John is said to have met Paul McCartney. The Quarrymen were playing and Paul just happened to come along. “It was a brilliant day, beautiful sunshine,” Julia says. “We met John at Woolton village, they were getting on the coal lorries that had been scrubbed, not entirely clean, him and his Quarrymen. “John sat at the end of the lorry. He was playing and Jackie and I went and grabbed a leg each to try and get him off. He was laughing his head off.” Then rehearsals began in earnest, with Paul joining The Quarrymen and then his younger pal, George Harrison. “I first met Paul in our kitchen,” says Julia. “He started coming round a lot. We all danced to Elvis and skiffle.”  The next year, days after The Quarrymen had recorded their first tracks, John and Julia’s mum was killed, struck by a car being driven by an off-duty police officer. Dealing with their loss as Beatlemania spiralled was tough. Julia says: “We were still suffering and then this huge thing was parallel. We all learned to separate things off in boxes.” Initially, John kept his little sisters close and Julia clearly remembers him coming home in 1964. “John slept on the floor in the front room. He wasn’t going to stay in a posh hotel in town.”  She also has fond memories of the Finsbury Park Astoria concert that year, laughing: “The Rolling Stones were in the dressing room so we knew they’d made it. They were all friends, drinking Coca-Cola – probably heavily laced.” She also recalls visiting John when he and first wife, Cynthia, moved with their son Julian to Surrey. Julia says: “We were opening fan letters and replying, ‘Yes, I will marry you, I’ll meet you at the church tomorrow’.” But after John moved to New York with Yoko Ono in 1971, they lost touch. In 1974, Julia finally received a phone call. They spoke for four hours. She says: “There was a lot of laughing and a lot of crying. He said, ‘Describe the room you’re in,’ and I said, ‘There are photos of Mummy and you and Jackie all round the walls’, and he said, ‘Send them to me’. So I stripped the walls.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton massive scar head","story":"NewsKate Middleton has a massive scar on her head - and there\u0027s a mystery behind itThe Duchess of Cambridge is skilled at covering a large scar on her head with her hair, but some eagle-eyed royal fans have spotted it in old photosShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer10:40, 25 AUG 2018Updated11:10, 25 AUG 2018NewsKate Middleton has a secret scar on her head - and it\u0027s huge!

Married to a prince, a wardrobe of designer clothes, an adorable family and an enviable head of glossy dark hair. But it turns out the 36-year-old has got something to hide. Sadly it\u0027s nothing scandalous or disturbing - no bizarre addiction or secret second husband to be found here. Kate\u0027s big secret is merely that she has a three-inch scar on the left side of her head - but how she got it is still a mystery.  Eagle-eyed royal fans first spotted the scar in 2011, but at the time people mistook the line on her temple for hair extensions.  So talked about was the photo, as people tried to work out where the scar came from, that Kensington Palace ended up releasing a brief statement about it.  They simply revealed that the scar is the result of a childhood operation. It is unclear as to what kind of operation Kate underwent and the palace declined to comment on the matter, saying simply that it was private.   According to the Daily Mail , senior royal sources claimed the operation was serious in nature.  However a medical professional has since debunked this claim.  John Scurr, a consultant surgeon at the Lister Hospital in London, told The Sun that it was unlikely to have been anything worrying.  He said: “I really doubt it was any serious medical condition and I would say it is as a result of an arteriovenous malformation – a birthmark – being removed.

While babies seem to be a little far away yet, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex haven\u0027t wasted time adding another four-legged friend to the family.  The pooch is believed to be a replacement for Meghan\u0027s Labrador-Shepherd mix rescue, Bogart, who she was forced to leave behind in Canada when she moved to Nottingham Cottage with Harry. She reportedly left him with friends in Toronto after deeming him too old to make the 3,500 mile journey to London. The alleged new arrival would join their rescue Beagle, Guy, who Meghan brought with her when she moved to the UK last November.   The dog is already happily ensconced at their cottage,  a royal source told The Daily Mail  Like the Sussexes, the dog will divide its time between the palace and their country home in the Cotswolds.  It’s not known if their new pooch is another rescue dog, but Harry’s stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, could have helped them get one from the Battersea Dogs \u0026amp Cats Home, where she is royal patron.   Meghan is said to have had a soft spot for animals since she was a child and rescued Guy and Bogart from a dog rescue centre in Los Angeles while she was with her first husband film producer Trevor Engelson .  He let her take the dogs with her to Canada when she won a role in the hit legal drama Suits.   Guy - who has his own Union flag coat and eats only organic food - has had a rapid turn around in fortunes since he was nearly put to sleep in 2016 .  Guy had only been in Canada for one day when Meghan spotted him, reportedly while looking for a companion for Bogart. The Beagle had been found wandering the woods in Kentucky and was reportedly days away from being put down. But when the Suits actress spotted him it was love at first sight and she took him home immediately, taking him for long walks in her local park when she wasn\u0027t filming Suits.

The distressed animals were seen on film being “aggressively handled” by staff at dairies belonging to Coombe Farm in Somerset, which supplies organic products to Waitrose and is RSPCA Assured. After receiving a tip-off about cruel handling, undercover footage was obtained by welfare charity Animal Equality in June and July this year. Coombe Farm boasts of high animal welfare standards and says on its website: “We believe that well-cared-for, relaxed dairy herds produce better milk and that this will be appreciated by the people who drink it.” But the charity claims that when it visited the farm on many occasions it found calves being force-fed and aggressively handled.  The creatures were allegedly denied water for over 24 hours on some of the hottest days of the year. A newborn was dragged by its legs and staff swore at and hit the animals. Several cows were seen with back legs shackled. In the footage, a worker appears to place his foot on a calf’s head after putting a stomach tube down its throat. He is then heard saying “You f***ing s***”as he squats down on the calf while its mother looks on. In another incident, a worker enters the pen as a calf is suckling from its mother. The calf is pulled away and a tube forced down its throat. One staff member was filmed dragging a calf by its hind legs, breaking RSPCA guidelines which state that animals must not be pulled or lifted by their tails, ears or limbs.  Cows were also filmed with their hind legs shackled. The practise is not illegal and is sometimes used to stop cows slipping to prevent injury. But DEFRA does not recommend it and it is condemned by many animal welfare charities. Dr Toni Shephard, executive director of Animal Equality, says: “Far from preventing injury, shackles help facilitate a farming system that works animals to the point of collapse. They simply enable farmers to squeeze every last drop of milk out of these poor worn-out mothers before they go to slaughter.” The charity also claims the calves were left without drinking water for more than 24 hours on days when temperatures soared over 30C. Dr Shephard says: “Consumers will be shocked to see such cruel treatment of tiny newborn calves with their heartbroken mothers forced to look on.  “These harrowing scenes are far from the much-romanticised [idea of an] organic farm. “The workers seen doing the force-feeding have no compassion or empathy with the newborn calves and should not continue to be employed on the farm. “But senior management also needs to be held accountable for inadequate training and supervision.” One of the UK’s leading experts on dairy cow and calf welfare, Prof John Webster of Bristol University’s Veterinary School, reviewed the footage. He slammed the “cruel” way the calves are being given colostrum – the type of milk they are being force-fed.  Prof Webster said: “Not only are the calves treated roughly and with a total absence of compassion, but it is easier to deliver colostrum by stomach tube when calves are gently restrained in a standing position with their heads inclined as they would be for sucking. “This is a reasonably affluent farm where the senior management has the knowledge required to promote good practice. “However, there appears to be a huge gulf between the management and the stockmen, who would appear to have received neither training nor supervision in the humane care of newborn calves.” "},{"url":null,"title":"nude hero who leapt bed","story":"NewsNude man leapt from bed to tackle teen trying to steal his Range Rover then declares: ‘I’m the Naked Ninja’Stephen Cullen was caught in hilarious CCTV bundling the drunk 17-year-old to the ground after he tried to steal his £10,000 \u0027pride and joy\u0027Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByRachel Bishop08:48, 25 AUG 2018Updated11:10, 25 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA nude man leapt from bed in the middle of the night to tackle a teen who tried to steal his \u0026pound10,000 Range Rover. Stephen Cullen, 29, boasted I\u0027m the Naked Ninja as he spoke about flooring the youngster outside his home in Newcastle at around 11.30pm on Tuesday. Hilarious CCTV shows Stephen running to his front gate as the car\u0027s lights flash and its alarm sounds before he bundles the 17-year-old to the ground. The guy realised I was naked, Stephen told the Sun. He didn’t know where to put his hands. Stephen and girlfriend Nicola Baldwin, 33, were in bed watching TV when he heard his alarm prompting him to spring into action.  Just moments before the wannabe thief was caught on the CCTV stumbling towards the vehicle and opening the door, which appeared to have been left unlocked. The teen - who was reportedly drunk - stays in the vehicle as the alarm sounds around him and Stephen suddenly emerges in the footage. He struggles with his front gate for a few seconds before managing to break through and race towards the car.  He is seen grabbing the young lad and shoving him to the ground as Nicola then comes into shot wearing a dressing gown. The lad reportedly kept saying: \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m sorry\u0027 as he towered over him. Nicola said it had looked like the teen was trying to hot-wire the car.

Instead of subjecting him to painful surgery, Charlie Proctor \u0027s parents have decided to focus on making \u0027magical memories\u0027 with their son.   The five-year-old has been fighting a rare form of the disease since 2016 and his mum and dad, Amber Schofeld and Ben Proctor, have been trying to raise \u0026pound300,000 for specialist treatment in America.  But, having recently been told it will actually cost more than \u0026pound850,000, Charlie\u0027s parents now face a heartbreaking reality. In an emotional Facebook post, Amber wrote: Our baby might not make Christmas because of money.  Amber and Ben have accepted the chemotherapy he is currently on will not cure him. Instead, it will make him extremely poorly. Acknowledging this, they have decided to cancel planned surgery to install a new Hickman line - a catheter most often used for the administration of chemotherapy.  Amber, who lives in Accrington, Lancashire, announced the news on Charlie\u0027s Facebook fundraising page , which she set up after his diagnosis.  She wrote: As much as it tears our hearts to bits we have to face reality, we have to see what is best for Charlie. We know he would rather make some magical memories whilst he can than keep making him poorly with treatment that isn\u0027t going to save him.  Tomorrow me and Ben will be going to Manchester hospital on our own to pick up Charlie\u0027s end of life oral chemo that he will take at home. This won\u0027t cure him but it will slow down the growth of his cancer without the horrible side effects so he can still be him. Charlie, who is big brother to sister Jessica, was diagnosed with liver cancer in at the start of 2016, after suffering a bug over Christmas. Doctors initially gave him a 90 per cent of survival, but chemotherapy did not work as they hoped and last month tests revealed more tumours had grown on his liver.   Even though Ben and Amber have stopped their efforts to raise money, they are still accepting donations on their JustGiving page .   They wrote: Fundraising has’t stopped, I\u0027ve asked for no more events as there is no time. Donations only, in hope someone wealthy can donate.   Amber and Ben\u0027s post in full With a heavy heart I have to now let you all know the devastating news. Saturday morning we received the cost estimate and with a liver transplant needed this time the price for Charlie\u0027s life, for him to have a future would be $1.1 million. We realise we could never raise this in time and therefore are stopping all fundraising events. They are too much time and effort for a small amount of what we now need. The chemotherapy Charlie is on isn\u0027t going to cure him, yes it\u0027s slowing the growth down but it also makes him so poorly to the point it will kill him. Yesterday morning we woke up in hospital ready to get his new Hickman line.  After a late night talk, me and Ben both feel it’s best to not put him through surgery for a Hickman line for something that isn\u0027t going to help. As much as it tears our hearts to bits we have to face reality, we have to see what is best for Charlie. We know he would rather make some magical memories whilst he can than keep making him poorly with treatment that isn’t going to save him. Tomorrow me and Ben will be going to Manchester hospital on our own to pick up Charlie\u0027s end of life oral chemo that he will take at home. This won\u0027t cure him but it will slow down the growth of his cancer without the horrible side effects so he can still be him. We haven\u0027t given up. We never will. We are trying him with home treatments and as much as we can to help save him but we have to try and come to terms with the outcome most likely to happen.

He\u0027s in Ireland to attend the World Meeting of Families (WMOF) and has a number of other engagements to complete. But according to his Instagram it seems he has kicked off his visit in style by completing an incredibly relatable activity.   A post online, which looks like it has come from the Pope\u0027s official Instagram account, suggests his first act of duty when heading off for Ireland was to indulge in a cheeky pint at the airport.  The image shows a pint of beer, with the airport car park in the background, alongside the caption: First pint of the trip! LOL. Airport pint has to be done.

Lyndon Newman, 31, launched a terrifying campaign of stalking and intimidation and bombarded his victim with threatening messages.  Detectives said she can now ‘breathe easily’ knowing that ‘this animal’ Newman is behind bars, MEN reports.  After a two week trial at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court, he was found guilty of rape and stalking. The former super welterweight - who was known in the ring as Lyndon ‘Lights Out’ Newman - has been jailed for 15 years. Newman, a charity fundraiser who is now unemployed, of Blackberry Lane, Brinnington, Stockport, was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life and given an indefinite restraining order against his victim. The court heard how in 2017 Newman forced himself on a woman.  Over the following months, he intimidated her with threatening messages over the phone, in text and on social media. On one occasion when she was visiting her friend’s flat, Newman turned up outside the property and started pouring the contents of a petrol can over the victim’s car. When she came out to confront him, he doused her in petrol too and threatened to set her on fire. She managed to placate Newman before he could take things any further. GMP Detective Constable Louise Isherwood said: “Not only did Newman subject his victim to a terrifying ordeal when he raped her but he then continued to make her life a misery as he led a campaign of intimidation against her.

The BBC programme originally aired in the 1960s has not been seen for almost 50 years. \u0027Royal Family\u0027 was created by Richard Cawston for the BBC and, much like reality TV shows of today, a film crew followed the family for 18 months. Footage included scenes like chatter across the breakfast table and Prince Charles in his younger years. But after the Queen gave her consent to the 38 hours of footage, according to the Express , she later decided the film pushed personal boundaries and ordered it to be kept hidden in the BBC vaults.  The two-hour documentary was aired on June 21, 1969, with 37 million viewers settling down to watch. But it was not just the Queen who decided against the footage, Princess Anne also turned her nose up. She later admitted: I never liked the idea of \u0027Royal Family\u0027, I thought it was a rotten idea. She added: The attention which had been brought upon one ever since one was a child, you just didn\u0027t need any more. Michael Bradsell, the film\u0027s editor, revealed he was initially hesitant about sharing his work with Her Majesty. We were all a little bit nervous of showing it to the Queen because we had no idea what she would make of it, he told Smithsonian Channel, who uploaded a clip of the documentary on YouTube. She was a little critical of the film in the sense she thought it was too long, but Dick Cawston, the director, persuaded her two hours was not a minute too long.  In a new ABC show, The Story of the Royals, experts have debated why the footage was banished. Some people say that this would open the floodgates, and therefore after that all the sort of tabloid interest in them [would come after], said royal biographer Hugo Vickers. They would want to know more, and more, and more. Robert Lacey, historical consultant on Netflix show The Crown, explained: They realised that if they did something like that too often, they would cheapen themselves, letting the magic seep out.

While one of the trio dressed in black stays on the bike two others - one wearing a bike helmet and the other wearing a woolly hat - swiftly jump off. The man in the hat then repeatedly hits the door with a brick trying to break the glass while the helmeted man stands behind.

But then a security guard comes round the corner and the man in the helmet runs towards the bike trying to jump on. He misses and the guard manages to grab him but he wriggles free and runs away free. The security guard comes back empty handed and is seen talking into his radio as he checks on the man. He tries to get him to come round but manages to knock him forward before he appears to start waking up. It is not known exactly where the footage, posted on Liveleak, took place.

Maximum temperatures in Celsius are set to plunge into the high teens by Sunday, with parts of the country expected to be battered by near gale-force winds. Drivers are being warned to expect delays as more than 14 million cars take to the roads for leisure trips between Thursday and Monday, according to the RAC. Met Office meteorologist Simon Partridge said wet and windy weather could cause further trouble for those travelling over the last long weekend before the festive period.  In places we are quite likely to see some standing water on the roads which will add to the difficult driving conditions on Sunday, he said. Some areas could see winds of between 30mph to 40mph, so a wet and windy day. Traffic information supplier Inrix predicted that the most delayed route will be the M5 from junction four to junction one in the West Midlands between 1pm and 6pm on Friday, when journeys with a typical travel time of 21 minutes could take an extra hour. On Saturday the M1 is predicted to be badly affected from junction 22 to junction 25 in the East Midlands, with typical journey times increasing from 16 minutes to 62 minutes.  Motorists\u0027 frustrations with the congestion could be heightened by the knowledge that fuel prices stand at a four-year high, with Government figures showing the average cost of a litre of petrol is \u0026pound1.29, while diesel is \u0026pound1.33. Engineering work on the railways means a number of routes are disrupted. Network Rail is urging passengers not to travel on the West Coast Main Line to and from London between Saturday and Monday as London Euston is closed. People who do travel between north-west England and the capital risk journeys that are far longer, busier and less comfortable than normal, the Government-owned company warned. London Euston, the UK\u0027s fifth busiest station, will also be closed during the following weekend, as work to replace a junction in Wembley continues.  Network Rail route managing director Martin Frobisher said: There is never an ideal time to shut the railway but these weekends are the least disruptive times to do it. Engineering work will also disrupt some services to Manchester, Birmingham International and Derby. Blustery showers in the north and west moved south-east on Friday, bringing a cool night for the UK, with some grass frost in Scotland on Saturday morning.

Shayna Hubers, 27, from Kentucky, sobbed in court during her murder trial on Tuesday after she was accused of \u0027cackling\u0027 as she shot Ryan Poston six times. The incident happened after she discovered her boyfriend was due to meet Miss Ohio 2012 for a date in October 2012. Hubers claims she acted in self defence and their relationship was wrought with abuse. According to Cincinnati\u0027s FOX 19, she said in her testimony: I remember thinking that he had a strong personality. I feared him. I felt like I needed to do what he was telling me to do.  In one incident, Hubers said Poston threw her out of a flat onto a porch and when she tried to get back inside, Hubers said that Poston repeatedly slammed the door on her body. The pair had been dating on and off for one-and-a-half years.  Cellmates Dona Dooley, Holly Vivens and Cecily Miller said she had laughed as she told them she gave Poston the \u0027nose job he always wanted\u0027. Their testimony was similar to that at her first trial in 2015, which found her guilty of murder only for the verdict to be thrown out because one of the jurors had a prior felony conviction. Nivens also said she overheard Hubers on the phone to her mum saying that Poston\u0027s family was rich enough to buy another son.  Dooley said: She would get on the phone and cry and sing to her mum and say there\u0027s worse crimes than murder. The prosecution summoned a forensics expert, who said Poston had been shot first in the forehead, twice in the back from three feet away while still seated, and a further three times in his torso from the same distance while he lay on the floor. Highland Heights Police Chief bill Birkenhauer said Hubers would log onto Poston\u0027s Facebook and block women.  He added that she bombarded him with a hundred texts for every one he would send after their regular break-ups. After the first trial, Hubers was sentenced to 40 years in prison without early parole on the account of showing no remorse.  Cambell Country Circuit Judge Fred Stine labelled the killing as cold-blooded an act as I\u0027ve seen.

The game grannies were roped in to star in ‘The Gran Tour’ for Rentalcars , taking them from drizzly Eccles to sun-soaked Catalonia.  Pat Jones, 75, June Glass, 79 and designated driver June Lomas, 73 were plucked from their weekly tap-dancing class and sent on the adventure of a lifetime. The grans ended up:  • Street dancing with Spanish teenagers  • Taking part in a death-defying indoor skydive  • Cracking up during a yoga class  • Creating their own giant heads out of papier-m\u0026acircch\u0026eacute  Proving you’re never too old for an unforgettable holiday, the tour saw the three Grans set off from Eccles, near Manchester, and collect the keys to a gleaming new Mercedes A-Class rental car soon after touching down in Barcelona.  As Pat and June G don’t drive, June L was given the enviable job of tour driver for their international voyage. She said: “I’m quite a confident driver at home, but driving abroad on the opposite side of the road in a brand new automatic, was an entirely different thing. “I was quite nervous at first – going round roundabouts is hard. I’d only been in the car a few minutes when I’d clipped the wing mirror. We made so many memories on the road – I wasn’t expecting the drive to be such a big part of the trip.” Each of the ladies were given the chance to choose an activity, with gran-of-three Pat opting for a sunset cruise on the Balearic sea, which wasn’t June L’s first choice. She said: “That is one thing I am not partial to, sailing. I’d rather swim behind the boat than be on it.”  The grans also found themselves street dancing with Spanish teenagers after a wild night out, making traditional giant heads in rural Catalonia and getting blasted with 120mph winds on an amazing indoor skydive experience. Reflecting on her once-in-a-lifetime trip, Pat said: “I loved all the scenery, we had so much freedom to get out and explore. The funniest thing was when we painted and wore those big heads – we couldn’t stop laughing. “The scariest thing was the skydiving – after I’d done it I felt incredible. One of the Junes is 80 next year and she did it, so I thought ‘I’ve got to do this. “I didn’t even have a passport before we went because it had run out. I normally get around with my bus pass.” June Glass is the oldest of the grans, and the only great-grandma of the group. The trio were all familiar with each other from a local tap dancing class, and while the two Junes were already firm friends, it was their first time truly getting to know Pat.

The iconic volcano appears to have reawakened in spectacular fashion as streams of scorching molten rock illuminated the Sicilian countryside on Thursday . Mount Etna has lain largely dormant for two years but began emitting signs of life in July, according to Italy\u0027s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology. No residents have been evacuated and the affected area appears limited following the explosions. At 10,926ft, Mount Etna is Europe\u0027s tallest peak south of the Alps and remains one of Sicily\u0027s most popular tourist destinations and attracts thousands of hikers on its peaks every year.  Although it has not been active recently, the volcano has been known to erupt sporadically, sometimes lasting for months and even years.  Last year, a group of tourists and a BBC film crew suffered burns and head injuries following a huge explosion of lava.   Around eight people have been injured by steam and boiling rocks suddenly erupting from the volcano .  Mountain rescue teams were sent in to save at least one group and treat the injured, including a BBC journalist who live-tweeted from the scene after her team ran down the mountain to escape.

He touched down at Dublin International Airport this morning for the start of his two day trip, the first papal visit to the country in 39 years. The wind blew his cape up over his head in a touching reminder of Pope John Paul, who visited Ireland almost 40 years ago. But, unlike his predecessor, he did not kiss the ground. Pope Francis was greeted by members of the clergy, representatives of Government and the local County Council as he left the plane and walked down a red carpet laid out for him.  He took off his “zucchetto” skull cap before accepting a bunch of flowers, in the papal colours of yellow, white and green, from Beth Coveney, nine, the eldest daughter of Deputy PM Simon Coveney. Francis smiled and chatted to Beth and her sister Jessica, seven, and Annalise, five, stroking their cheeks. The Pope met with the Irish President at his residence, before heading to Dublin Castle where he met with the Irish Prime Minister and gave a speech in which he addressed the abuse scandal.   The Pope earlier went to meet the Irish President Michael D Higgins and his wife, and they were pictured together outside his official residence in a historic moment.  After the Irish and Vatican national anthems were played His Holiness passed a Guard of Honour made up of members of the Irish Naval Service who have taken part in operations to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean and tackle people smugglers. They were chosen because the Pope has frequently highlighted the plight of migrants and refugees around the word. He signed the Visitors’ Book in the State Reception Room and then went for a private 15 minute chat with the Head of State.  A spokesman for Mr Higgins said that during the meeting, the Irish President raised with the pope the “immense suffering and hurt caused by child sex abuse perpetrated by some within the Catholic Church”. In a statement issued after the meeting, the spokesman said Mr Higgins told Pope Francis of the “anger which had been conveyed to him at what was perceived to be the impunity enjoyed by those who had the responsibility of bringing such abuses for action by the appropriate authorities and have not done so”. “The President welcomed the honest and forthright language that His Holiness used when addressing the issue in his recent Letter to the People of God,” the spokesman for the President said. “He conveyed to Pope Francis the widely-held view that all would benefit from a set of actions that gave the necessary assurances to all citizens past, present and future, of all faiths and none.”  The Pope then headed over to Dublin Castle to meet authorities and diplomats.  He made a speech where he addressed his feelings of pain and shame at the failure of the church authorities to tackle clerical abuse in Ireland.  In his speech, Pope Francis said: With regard to the most vulnerable, I cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal caused in Ireland by the abuse of young people by members of the church charged with responsibility for their protection and education. The failure of ecclesiastical authorities - bishops, religious superiors, priests and others - adequately to address these repellent crimes has rightly given rise to outrage and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community. I myself share those sentiments.  Before the Pope spoke, he received a welcome speech from Ireland\u0027s Prime Minister Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. In a speech in front of the pontiff inside Dublin Castle, Mr Varadkar said the past treatment of many women and young people by church and state had left a history of “sorrow and shame”. “In place of Christian charity, forgiveness and compassion, far too often there was judgement, severity and cruelty, in particular towards women and children and those on the margins,” Mr Varadkar said. The Pope will receive a warm reception over the weekend from thousands of pilgrims who have travelled to be part of the occasion. But the Pope will also be met by protesters angry at how the church dealt with multiple clerical sex abuse scandals that have damaged trust in the religious institution and seriously weakened its influence on Irish society. Pope Francis will meet a number of abuse victims in a private meeting.  Earlier this week, the Pope wrote a 2,000-word letter to Catholics in which he condemned the crime of sexual abuse by priests and subsequent cover-ups. He demanded accountability in response to fresh revelations in Pennsylvania in the United States of decades of misconduct by clerics. Yellow and white flags of the Vatican were flying along the River Liffey this morning to mark the papal visit.  The Pontiff will witness a country that has undergone seismic social changes in the four decades since the last papal visit in 1979, when John Paul II was lauded by a nation shaped by its relationship with an all-powerful Catholic Church. Pope Francis is ostensibly in Ireland to attend the World Meeting of Families (WMOF) - a major global church event focused on promoting family values. However, he will also fulfil a number of other engagements, including meetings with President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.  With Ireland in the midst of a high-profile homelessness problem, the Pope will also meet a number of impacted families at a centre run by a religious order. Thousands are expected to line the streets of Dublin city centre on Saturday afternoon as the Pope passes through in his famous Pope Mobile. In the evening he will join 80,000 pilgrims at a musical festival in the landmark Croke Park Gaelic Athletic Association stadium.  The World Meeting Of Families 2018 Festival of Families event is choreographed as a celebration of family life. World renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli will take centre stage and will join the cast including Nathan Carter, Daniel O’Donnell, Celine Byrne, Se\u0026aacuten Keane, Eimear Quinn, Cuthbert Tura Arutura, the Palestrina Choir and the Choir of Ages. As well as these artists, the cast for the Festival of Families will include an orchestra of more than 50 musicians over 700 Irish, Sean N\u0026oacutes and contemporary dancers, including 500 from Irish dance schools across the country a 1,000-strong choir 100 community groups, and 300 flag bearers. The selection of themes and artists featured in the event reflect many of the priorities in the ministry of Pope Francis. These include homelessness and those on the margins migrants and refugees care for our common home and the importance of the family. Pope Francis will join the Festival of Families one hour into the event and following a tour of Croke Park will deliver an address to all gathered in the stadium.  The stage design for the Festival of Families will include a ‘Circle of Encounter’ where Pope Francis will join with families from across the world. He will hear testimonies from five families from Ireland, Canada, India, Iraq and Burkina Faso. The themes of the family testimonies will focus on: forgiveness in family strength in family hope in family life the intergenerational nature of families today and the impact of technology on family life.

It\u0027s not 100 per cent clear why this decision has been made, but the palette\u0027s creator, Wende Zomnir, said it was essential for the company to always evolve and that they would turn the grief into greatness. In a statement, Urban Decay added: Today the beauty world mourns Urban Decay\u0027s beloved Naked Palette , the product that revolutionized neutral eyeshadows.  A little bit naughty, often dramatic, and always in the press, the innovative game-changer and category creator will be laid to rest after eight years, without a smudge of regret. Passionate Naked collectors - and pretty much anyone with eyes - will remember Naked as the beauty product that changed their lids forver. It was beautiful and mythical and millions of superfans, from misfits to moms to models, will miss Naked from Virgin to Gunmetal. Urban Decay have even gone as far as to hold a funeral for the palette, which they said took place in Newport Beach in California on August 23. Beauty influencers such as Kandee Johnson, Christen Dominique, Katy DeGroot, Shayla Mitchell, and Chrisspy attended to pay their respects to Naked, while the eulogy was read by Nicole Richie .  Make-up fans on twitter have also been mourning the loss of the product. One wrote: A moment of silence please for the OG eyeshadow palette that started it all. So long Urban Decay Naked Palette. Another commented: So sad Urban Decay is getting rid of their OG Naked palette that palette will forever remind me of all the times I used it while getting ready to go out with my bestie during our college days. A third posted: I’m still in shock. The Naked Palette is what put them on the map in my opinion. The world really IS coming to an end.

safranko admits understanding the dundonian accent has been his biggest hurdle","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United new boy Pavol Safranko has revealed the biggest hurdle he’s encountered since arriving has been learning to work out English – Scottish-style.The Slovakian international was an instant hit in Tangerine as he scored a cracking debut goal in the 2-0 win at Queen of the South a fortnight ago.And from what he’s seen of Scottish football so far, the 23-year-old is feeling good about fitting in to life in the Championship with United.Having already switched countries successfully once when he moved from Dunajska Streda in his homeland to Danish outfit Aalborg last year, he did not anticipate too many problems with getting used to the culture here.Particularly as his language of choice in Denmark was very often English.“I was one year in Denmark and everyone speaks English and I thought this is good for me coming here,” he said.“But when I came to the training ground from Dundee for the first time, the taxi driver spoke with me and I didn’t understand anything.“I had to ask him two or three times to say again before I understood what he said. It was not a big problem because he was a nice guy.“I will try to learn the accent here and it will happen but when I arrived it was more difficult to understand English here than I thought it would be.”While learning to speak, or at least understand, Dundonian, Safranko will also be reading up on the opposition he’s going to face in the Championship, starting with today\u0026#8217s visitors Partick Thistle.For him, though, the most important factor being at Tannadice will be getting to know his team-mates and focusing on playing to his and their strengths.“I do not know Partick Thistle. I do not know too much about any of the other clubs, so we have to see some videos, play games, and after I can say something about our opponents.“I think this can be a good thing. You always have to start from the ‘us’, from what we will do and not think too much about the other teams. This is a good way to build the winning mentality.“It’s more important to learn about team-mates than the other teams. I have had three weeks training now, that helps.“And it is important that we are winning games while we are learning about each other. There are many new players here and we will get better as a team but we must win while this happens.”With that impressive debut coming down in the Dumfries, for most United fans today will be their first glimpse of Safranko.Giving them a preview of what to expect he’s told them to look for him in the penalty box. He knows that’s where his worth to the team lies and that is where he wants to spend most of his time.“I am a striker who gets into the penalty box. This is my area to play. Hey, I am not good outside the box – I know where I am and that is where I play.“I hope this is good for United and that it is where we will play. Then I can help the team and that is what is most important.“We were good in my first game and we were the better team first half, so we were attacking.“Maybe not second half but we won. I hope the second game will be even better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fd04af1b5a-836x564.jpg ","title":"elton ngwatala dundee players must trust each other to turn form around","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBelief is key for Dundee, says Elton Ngwatala, if they are to chalk up their first league points of the campaign.The Dark Blues will make the short journey to Perth to take on Tayside rivals St Johnstone in what has become a crucial fixture.The Dens men go into the clash stuck on zero points after two Premiership games keen not to repeat their slow start to last season.It took last year’s team until mid-September to register their first victory of the campaign – notably against today\u0026#8217s opponents, Saints, in a 3-2 victory at Dens Park.To repeat that, Ngwatala – one of the summer recruits – insists it’s about the players trusting each other to earn themselves a first win of the campaign.The Frenchman said: “Last week was, obviously, a very disappointing result for us but I think we have to look forward now.“We are back in the league matches and we have to start winning games, that’s the most important thing.“We can take a lot from the last game and learn from our mistakes. We will do everything we can to win but we have to score as well.“Obviously, we can do so much better than we have done.“Everybody in the team knows that but we have to improve and keep improving every week.“Now, everybody is on it. Everybody wants to do the best for the team, whatever the starting XI or subs, everybody wants to be part of it and we need that to be successful.”Before the 3-0 home loss to Championship side Ayr United, Dundee’s big problem was putting away the chances they were creating against St Mirren and Aberdeen.The defeat to the Honest Men has put a whole different spin on the club’s start to the season, however.Ngwatala, though, says there is plenty of talent in the current squad to create a positive twist in the story of Dundee’s season tomorrow at McDiarmid Park.“The first two games, I don’t think we deserved to lose,” he added.“That’s the way it is, though, and now I think we have to be prepared to fight every game.“As a team you have to give everything to get the win.“Even if we have to wait to score in the 95th-minute we’ll do that – you have to believe to the end.“We have to go there with confidence and express ourselves and do the best we can to get the three points.”And Ngwatala says the points will only be heading their way if they can work as a team and trust each other to get the better of their Tayside rivals – that’s the message from boss Neil McCann, anyway.“The manager has said we have to believe in ourselves, believe in what we can do and trust each other.“If we do that, we’ll get what we deserve.“It’s going to be a tough game – we have to treat this game like any other and prepare like we would against any team.“We must go there and do everything we can to get a result.”In those two league games, getting anything positive on the scoresheet was a big issue with Ngwatala the only Dundee player yet to find the net.He’s pleased to have got off the mark in goalscoring terms but would much rather have points on the board.“It was good for me to get the first goal so now I’m relaxed, the first is gone and I can carry on now.“However, I need my teammates to help me score and I will help them to do the same.“I want to score but when I do, I want my team to win, not just get a goal and we lose the game.“I want to help my team get points, that’s all I want.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fd01d91b28-376x564.jpg ","title":"fascinating dundee year books detailing citys past go on display","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFascinating facts and figures which would otherwise have been lost to the annals of time are now on display to the public in Dundee.More than four decades of history appear in copies of the Dundee Year Book, which are owned by Dundee City Archives.First published in 1871, important information about the city’s population, economy and buildings is contained in the bound books.The final edition was printed in 1914 – probably due to the outbreak of the First World War.Martin Allan, 41, who works at the Dundee City Archives in City Square, said the books were a handy resource for anyone researching family history or local events.Martin, an archivist, said: “The books are kind of a mixed, potted history of what was happening in the city at that time, and are a valuable resource to have.“The first edition we have is from 1871, and there are annual editions right up until 1914.“There are records of things like notable people who died that year.“There are also articles on any notable buildings which were constructed that year.“For example there are details of the original Customs House on Greenmarket. There’s a detailed, two-page article about the building including its history.“In the 1893 edition, there are records of the Maryfield Hospital being built, which was originally the East Poorhouse Hospital.”The East Poorhouse Hospital was opened in 1893 by Dundee Parish Council for the treatment of the sick poor – more than 50 years before the NHS was established.The hospital was built alongside the East Poorhouse, situated on five acres of land near Stobswell, on the west side of Mains Loan, south of Clepington Road.The hospital therefore accommodated paupers, including the physically and mentally ill.In the later 19th Century the West Poorhouse was used for the “elderly, infirm or insane” poor, whereas younger, able-bodied poor were housed in the East Poorhouse.The books also list the valuation of properties, births, marriages and deaths, and “the cost of maintenance of paupers” – which breaks down the expenditure of the city’s poorhouses.They also show how the population of the city rose dramatically in the 1800s.In 1821, there were 30,575 people living in the city.The population rose by between 12,000 and 30,000 in each of the following seven decades, and had reached 155,985 by 1891 – higher than the population of about 148,000 in the Dundee City Council area today.Martin added: “The Dundee Year Books also have things like a diary of events which happened that year, which is an excellent reference point for people.“And it also lists things like shipping, local trade, ship- building, and births, marriages and deaths.“There are also obituaries for some of the more notable people in the city if you were researching well-known local businessmen, former provosts and other prominent people like that.“It’s mainly people who held public office or who had some sort of standing in the local community.“So in terms of people researching these types of things, the books are really are invaluable.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fd016034e9-e1535108915987-720x564.jpg ","title":"feat of strength recognised at holyrood","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee-born nurse who became the first woman in almost half a century to conquer a remarkable test of strength has been congratulated by the Scottish Parliament.Leigh Holland-Keen, 29, lifted the Dinnie Stones – two granite boulders that together weigh 733lb – in front of a crowd of 400 people.She was the first female in 40 years to do so and one of fewer than 100 people who have accomplished the feat.Ms Holland-Keen, who now lives in Australia, made history at Potarch, on Deeside, where the stones sit outside the Old Potarch Hotel.A North-East MSP has now marked the Sydney strongwoman’s feat with a motion at Holyrood.Scottish Conservative Alexander Burnett said: “Fewer than 100 people have managed to lift the stones since Donald Dinnie carried them the length of the Potarch Bridge in 1860.“Leigh was the first woman to do so in about 40 years.

But contemporary photographs held in the city’s archives show that 31-33 Castle Street was not demolished.The sandstone building was annexed and included in the design and construction of the new Caird Hall complex and received a fresh, modern appearance.Unfortunately, history buffs can no longer see the castle rock as the final touches to the building included the provision of false walls and new flooring in the basement.The former Kennedy’s Steak House closed several years ago and has lain empty ever since.The council-owned building had slipped into a state of disrepair.In a bid to attract a new occupant to the site, an “extensive” refurbishment of the building is under way.In all, £183,000 has been set aside to strip out the unit and make it ready for a new tenant to move

chance he gets this campaign with both hands.The 19-year-old featured in the two final home matches of last season, as a substitute in a 1-0 win over Hamilton before starting the home defeat to Partick Thistle that concluded the campaign.The Welshman, who started his career in Swansea’s youth academy, joined the Dark Blues in January after leaving Colchester United and impressed in the U/20s team that narrowly missed out on the Development League title.He also grabbed a goal in last week’s Irn-Bru Cup win over Hibs Colts for the Dundee youth side and says he thinks he’s ready for another shot at first-team football.Though, he admits jokingly, he might have to calm himself next time he’s out on the pitch in the senior game.Describing his time in the first team last season, he said: “I loved every second of it – once you step on that pitch everything is mad, it’s crazy and you don’t know what to do!“You need to calm yourself down a bit but I’m buzzing to have played for the first team and, hopefully, I can get more chances this season.“I think I’m ready to make the step up.“With the players in front of me in my position, I’m always learning from them, they are always helping me and everyone around the training ground is helping me.“If I do get a chance this year, I’ll give my all and I think I am ready for it – I’ll definitely take it with both hands and I won’t look back.”As a centre-back, Jefferies certainly has plenty of competition to get through ahead of him.As far as central defenders go, the Dark Blues boast an array of experience – Steven Caulker being an England international and former Liverpool and Spurs defender, Darren O’Dea won numerous trophies at Celtic, Josh Meekings is a Scottish Cup winner and Genseric Kusunga has two Swiss league titles to his name.For Jefferies, that doesn’t pose an insurmountable hurdle but rather gives him an ideal opportunity to learn from players who have been there and done it.He added: “In training if you make a mistake, they don’t really get on to you, they encourage more than anything.“They want everyone to improve every day and because I’m young, I’m 19, I look up to the likes of Steven Caulker, Darren O’Dea, Josh Meekings and Gense – I mean, they’ve got some amount of experience.“I hope they can share it with me and I can move on with them.”After making the move north, Jefferies has settled into life quickly in Dundee and says the possibility of first-team football at a club with the stature of the Dark Blues was a big draw for him.“It was a quick six months at Colchester before the opportunity came about up here,” he added.“It’s a good club, I love it here, the people are friendly and I think I can learn more up here and maybe break into the first team.“The manager definitely gives young players a chance if he thinks they deserve it.“He believes in the youngsters and I am very grateful for the chance I had last season.“Hopefully, I can get more this year.“We play the same way as the first team and it’s all the same at Dundee so it’s not too much of a step up from reserve football but it’s older men with experience and you just have to put yourself about.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"life long dundee fan liverpool midfielder charlie adam linked with move away from stoke bolton wanderers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fan Charlie Adam looks set for

Whether or not either is fit to start on Saturday remains to be seen.A swollen knee means Murdoch hasn’t played since the Betfred Cup tie against Alloa a month ago.Whereas Booth’s absence stretches back a few days longer, to when he picked up a knock at Ross County in his only competitive appearance so far.Just the fact both are back working normally, however, is good news for their gaffer, though he remains frustrated by the continued absence of winger Billy King because of a thigh injury.“Callum Booth has trained with the team and also Stewart Murdoch has trained fully with the team, so they are now fit.“Billy King is still struggling with this stupid injury that he didn’t even get from training,” added Csaba.“He hasn’t done one training session so far this season.“Last season he was one of the most important players for the team but he is struggling with this injury and it continues to affect him.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fcfb15731c-940x448.jpg ","title":"planned female custody unit for dundee could be up and running by 2020","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Scottish Prison Service has submitted its application to build a women’s custody unit in the Hilltown area.If given the green light, the community custody unit (CCU) will open in late 2020 on Nelson Street, at the site of the former Our Lady’s Primary School.The complex will house up to 16 female prisoners, mainly from Dundee and the surrounding areas, who have been assessed as suitable to be reintroduced to the community.It is hoped the new units will reduce the risk of re-offending by maintaining the women’s links with their communities and families.The SPS held its third and final information session on the custody suite at Central Library at the Wellgate centre on Thursday.Tom Fox, head of corporate affairs at SPS, said: “I think everybody who wanted to see what we are proposing has had the opportunity to see it.“Like any potential developer, we will be fully involved in the application process and we would hope that will go on until the later part of the year, but that is a matter for the council.”Work on the facility should begin early next year if councillors approve the plans.The CCU will consist of three main houses and the plans also include a single-storey hub building, formation of new access, boundary fencing, car parking, electric vehicle charging points, cycle stands, service access, landscaping and CCTV.The SPS has said no women will be allowed out without a risk assessment being carried out, adding that the site would be “completely secure” – with prisoners only allowed out on licence for things like medical appointments.At present, the only female custody unit in Scotland is HM Prison Cornton Vale, in Stirling, which is due to close in 2020.Nelson Street was one of 23 sites in the city that were considered for the building when the closure of Cornton Vale was announced.The women’s custody unit would be the second of its kind in Scotland.

That is what we want to do.“We go to Hibs confident and coming off the back of a great result against St Mirren (4-0 BetFred Cup) where we played really well.”As well as securing fresh signings, fundamental to progression is retaining the top performers.Aberdeen this week rejected a £3.5 million bid from defending champions Celtic for Scotland international Scott McKenna.Following the bid’s rejection Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers confirmed he would end his pursuit, for this window, of the defender.“I am sure there will be lots of teams looking at Scott,” said Lewis.“He is a great player and we are lucky to have him.“It will be great for him to stay. “At the moment Scott is an Aberdeen player and we are very pleased to have him.”McKenna will not take his usual place at left-sided centre-back in front of Lewis today because the 21-year-old is ruled out with a hamstring tear. He is set to return after the international break next month.Aberdeen, however, do welcome back two defenders today with Shay Logan returning from a three-match suspension.On-loan Watford stopper Tommie Hoban has also recovered from a knee injury that ruled him out of the last three games.For the previous two matches, with Mark Reynolds out for six months following knee surgery, the Reds have had four of six first-team defenders ruled out.Yet they have kept clean sheets in both matches. Lewis, 30, reckons that is testament to the depth and versatility within the squad.“We have had a few injuries and Shay was suspended,” he said.“However, we still got clean sheets and that breeds confidence.“There is a solidness within the team that I felt we had towards the back-end of last season and are now keeping that going this season.“It was a very good performance against St Mirren and we had been waiting for that to happen, to get into our stride.“Going forward we were excellent and defensively we were not under too much pressure.“I only had one shot to save during the whole game which is credit to the lads going forward.“And to the mental side of it from the back four and myself, just making sure we are switched on and in the right positions so that when the ball does get cleared by them we can keep it in their half. When called up we defended well.”For Lewis, his job, and that of the defence, is to provide the platform for the Reds’ attacking players to go on and win the match.He said: “We are a strong team and dominate possession in a lot of games, especially at home.“For myself it is about keeping that concentration and talking to the back four as much as I can to keep them on their toes while we are attacking.“And when we are defending the forward lads also come in and join in with that as well.“There are goals in this team. We know we have enough strength going forward that if we can be strong at the back it will give us a good platform.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"would you insure salary worth 1 2m","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSomething worth £1.2 million is very valuable indeed.

Even if one is optimistic and assumes a claimant receives the full weekly £110, that works out to £5,720 per annum.Is that enough for you to live on?I don’t mean to paint such a gloomy picture. But, when one considers the average family spend is around £2,292 a month, we can begin to appreciate that this is a critical issue. For those who have recently bought a home or have young children, a continual monthly income is vital.So, to return to the original question, why do so few of us have protection in place?Many people assume their employer would support them and, while this can be the case for short-term illnesses, longer-term support is rare indeed.Perhaps some would rely on credit, but that is best avoided.Moreover, there is an interesting psychological perspective to it all – a condition called optimism bias.This extremely common bias is essentially the under-appreciation of something bad occurring, and in turn you are less prepared when it does occur.According to a leading insurer, a 30-year-old male has a 58% chance of being unable to work for two months or more before reaching retirement age.So, should you consider an Income Protection Insurance (IPI) policy? Well, if you are receiving a salary, have monthly commitments and your employer does not provide IPI, then yes, it might not be a bad idea. As with most financial considerations, a review of your individual circumstances is important, and we at AAB Wealth would be glad to talk you through your options.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"boy finds pet cat strung up by neck","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA nine-year-old boy found his cat fighting for its life after yobs hung the animal from its neck with a dog lead.Ricky Henderson, from the Garthdee area of Aberdeen, today told how his wife Gail, 34, and son Cole, 9, found their pet Scruffy.A thick dog’s lead had been tied around the cat’s neck and attached to the top of a high fence near their home.The 33-year-old, who is assistant manager at Goals, said: “They realised they hadn’t seen him all day and then they heard him crying out the back.“My nine-year-old son found him on the fence struggling for his life.“He was round the back hanging on the end of a high fence.“He was soaked to the bone and his fur was on the fence because he must have been rolling around. His gums were bleeding as well.“Cole was very upset. He ran to get his mum as he couldn’t get him off the fence.”Scruffy, who is 11 months old, is “very friendly” and approaches everyone, according to his owner.The family have put an appeal on social media in a bid to find the culprits and to make other pet owners aware. Their message has been shared more than 1,500 times, and has spread shockwaves among the community.But Ricky, who also owns another cat, Matilda, said he is wary of letting his cats out in the garden after Wednesday’s incident.He added: “You do start to think about who your neighbours are.“If the person that’s done this sees the comments then hopefully they see how sick it is and how much people care about animals.”Paul O’Connor, chairman of Garthdee Community Council, said: “People should be vigilant about where their pets are.“I’m shocked and disgusted that this would happen in our neighbourhood and it’s not something I’ve ever heard of or witnessed in the past. We won’t tolerate it.”Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “We have not received any calls in relation to this incident, however it was clearly a very cruel and idiotic act.“We would urge cat owners to be vigilant and anyone who witnesses anything relating to animal cruelty should call our Animal Helpline on 03000 999 999.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cobbles in line to be fixed in spring1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCobbles in an Aberdeen conservation area which were temporarily covered with tarmac are expected to be repaired next year.The Old Aberdeen community previously hit out at the eyesore repairs undertaken to a section of the cobbled High Street.The works, at College Bounds and High Street, were undertaken by Aberdeen City Council in May this year, to improve safety in the area where there were sections of missing stones.It emerged that to make the repairs, it would cost Aberdeen City Council more than £100,000, which the local authority said could not be accommodated within the current financial year’s budget.The Old Aberdeen Community Council, alongside councillors, wrote to the local authority urging officers to take urgent remedial action, with Councillor Alexander McLellan even writing to outside bodies in a bid to secure the funding that was needed to carry out the repairs.At a meeting of the Old Aberdeen Community Council on Tuesday evening, a roads officer revealed that a source of funding has now been identified, and that it is hoped work will be carried out in the spring.Transport spokesman at Aberdeen City Council and ward councillor for Old Aberdeen, Ross Grant, said: “When there is a defect in the cobbles the problem can become a domino effect if it’s not dealt with.“The council officers said that 70 metres of the road will be reconditioned – where the cobbles will be taken up and relayed in the full and proper way.”Repairs were carried out after a member of the public tripped on the cobblestones and reported it to the council.The problem was classified as a category two defect by safety inspectors and, as a result, the repairs had to be carried out within a week.Pouring tarmac on the road was deemed the fastest way to temporarily repair the area without damaging the cobblestones.To fully repair the road, it will take six to eight weeks, followed by a further four weeks to cure.Mr Grant added: “The work the council is carrying out is to repair the road as properly as they can.“As an administration, we are committed to seeing the works through and keeping the community involved.”Utilities companies need to be given three months’ statutory notice to plan work, which made an immediate permanent fix earlier this year unfeasible.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"course aims to help would be teachers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn initiative has been launched to help would-be teachers overcome a barrier from entering the profession.Aberdeen University has introduced a new online access course to allow those who want to teach gain qualifications they need in maths and English.Dr David Smith, head of the school of education, said: “There is a great demand for teachers in Scotland, particularly in certain subject areas and many people who have enjoyed successful careers in other industries want to meet that need.“Many are extremely well qualified in the subject areas that they want to teach however, given the responsibility of all for literacy and numeracy, all teachers are expected to demonstrate their ability in English and mathematics.“Our experience of meeting prospective student teachers highlighted to us a gap in their own formal education in these subjects, which was holding them back from gaining entry to our Professional Graduate Diploma in Education, which educates many of our new teachers.”The course has been set up to tackle challenges in teacher recruitment across the north-east.

She said: “There’s always going to be nostalgia for the place.“Our project co-ordinator has been here for a long time, we’ve got a member of staff who’s been here for 20 years, so it’s part of their life. I’d imagine it’ll be emotional.”The nursery moved from Logie Place into purpose-built premises within the Hub, on Manor Avenue, in January last year.According to Marie, the move has dramatically improved the quality of the nursery, with more children being able to attend, increasing the catchment area they can serve.Marie said: “Before, we could only serve Middlefield, but now we can take children from Heathryfold, Cummings Park, Marchburn and other places in the local area, so more people are really seeing the benefits.”The new facility has also improved the quality of care, she added.“It’s greatly improved the facilities that we have – it’s a purpose-built nursery and the space we have is much bigger, and it’s much more open plan,” Marie said.“We have better access to the outdoors – the doors open up into the nursery garden, which was always our vision, to give the children a choice.”Transport Scotland announced that the demolition will take place between 1.30 and 2pm on Monday.A spokesman said: “Transport Scotland is pleased to accommodate the request of Middlefield Community Project Nursery for the opportunity to visit the site during demolition of their former premises, which are part of the ongoing works being carried out in preparation for the A90/A96 Haudagain Improvement Project.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dolphin sightings soar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA popular initiative for spotting marine life in Aberdeen had a 100% success rate for sightings this summer.Dolphinwatch at the Torry Battery recorded either dolphins, whales or porpoises every day during the three-month scheme.The team behind Dolphinwatch said it was a 14% increase on sightings from last year.There were only three days where a dolphin wasn’t spotted but on those days visitors were lucky to see minke whales, harbour porpoises and a humpback whale.Since the scheme started in 2013, the RSPB Scotland team has seen the project grow, and now includes the free use of telescopes and binoculars.Laura Watson, Dolphinwatch visitor experience officer for RSPB Scotland, said: “The high number of sightings confirms that Aberdeen is one of the best and most reliable places in Europe to see bottlenose dolphins.“Since May, thousands of visitors have been amazed by their gravity-defying leaps, tail-slapping and bow-riding. On average the pod sizes have included around 14 individuals.“There have also been occasions when we have witnessed groups of over 30 animals feeding and surfing the waves.”RSPB Scotland said 72 different species, including birds, were spotted and there were 3,500 visits across the three months.Laura added: “We have been wowed by the variety of bird life we’ve seen, including ospreys, gannets, cormorants, curlews and even a puffin out at sea. An otter has been spotted several times too, but, for me, the real highlight of the season came on July 21 when everyone was thrilled to see three minke whales pass by.“Our visitors were in awe and the whole team were almost vibrating with excitement.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"imagination and colour at lochgilphead lego show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/08/18, 6:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA vast array of imaginative models were on display at the two-day Lochgilphead Lego Show.Lochgilphead Community Centre was the venue for the weekend of plastic brick magic on Saturday August 4 and Sunday August 5.Interactive workshops with Glasgow-based Bricks4Kids gave an insight into basic engineering using Lego, while the imagination room did exactly what the name suggests.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

The venue at The Isthmus in Tarbert, the great organisation and marshalling, provided the perfect event for cyclists to really embrace the sportive ethos. This is not a race but all about your own personal challenge and performance and the camaraderie of cyclists experiencing new routes \u0026#8211 but Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle Club had to cross the line first for bragging rights alone.’The route is 40 mile loop, heading north out of Tarbert, then over to Ormsary and Kilberry and returning to Tarbert. The cyclists were faced with  2,500 feet of climbing, and descending, with flat fast sections and breathtaking scenery.Stephen added: ‘I particularly enjoyed us chasing and catching the postman in his van on his rural round.’Sixteen-year-old Ethan Gascoigne said: \u0026#8216I really enjoyed the tough route. I was glad the age limit had been lowered since I could enjoy the race with my dad.\u0026#8217John Hardie, the event organiser said: ‘With the guidance of British Cycling we managed to stage our event.

The new charging schedule will streamline the process of providing the film industry with a flexible range of options for film productions using council assets.The process will also ensure the council is providing a fair approach to charging, avoiding uncertainty and delay with enquiries. The charging model is negotiable, with the charges representing a percentage of the production’s estimated daily local spend in Argyll and Bute. This would ensure smaller productions are not unduly impacted.Councillor Aileen Morton, policy lead for economic development, said: \u0026#8216Clearly Argyll and Bute is very popular with film crews, from very small productions all the way up to films that will be seen on the big screen around the world.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles MSP said the rises are the last thing hard-up passengers need.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyScottish LabourGlasgowAyrKilmarnockEconomyTransportLockerbieKilmarnock NewsTransport ScotlandCheap travel"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"musical tribute concert honour loved","story":"NewsMusical tribute concert will honour loved onesFollowing on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:27, 22 AUG 2018NewsColin Price and Pauline Moriarty join together for the tribute concert (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA musical tribute concert will honour the lives of two well loved members of the community. Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO). It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7 (under 12s and over 65s \u0026pound5) are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine.

Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-young-would-be-politicians-to-make-a-difference","story":"YOUNG Borderers with a passion for politics are being urged to register their interest for next year\u0026rsquos Scottish Youth Parliament elections.\nThe elections are due to take place in March and those aged between 14 and 25 are eligible to stand.\nThe democratically-elected Scottish Youth Parliament (SYP) aims to give Scotland\u0026rsquos youngsters a voice.\nWith the decision makers of Scotland taking notice, it allows young people to campaign on the issues which they feel matter most.\nThere are three Scottish Borders MYSPs, elected by their peers. They are supported by staff from Scottish Borders Youth Voice to attend three sittings of the SYP a year and to deliver and develop local and national campaigns. They can also sit as members or convenors of committee groups.\nMYSPs normally serve a two-year term, but two Borders representatives had to stand down early to attend university. A by-election was held in June which saw Alex Morgan elected to represent Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale and Lucy Lauder as MSYP Elect for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire.\nOutgoing Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSYP Sanna Aziz said: \u0026ldquoThank you for the opportunity to represent the young people of this constituency for a year at the Scottish Youth Parliament. It has been the most amazing year of my life, making sure that we the young people aren\u0026rsquot forgotten.\nAnd outgoing Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire representative Tanya Thomson, added: \u0026ldquoThe past year has been absolutely amazing and I\u0026rsquom gutted to step down.

Once elected, MYSPs continue to be supported to carry out their responsibilities to the best of their ability.\n\u0026ldquoThis really is an opportunity not to be missed and I look forward to seeing how the nominations progress and meeting the young people who are keen to be involved. It is particularly important in the Year of Young People that we make sure their voices are heard and the Youth Parliament is a vital platform for making this happen.\nAnyone interested in standing for the 2019 election is being asked to register their interest by visiting: elections.syp.org.uk/elections and completing the Expression of Interest Form.\nThe Expression of Interest period is open until Wednesday, October 31. Applicants will be invited to a meeting at the start of November where they can meet the current MSYPs and be helped to develop their candidate profile and plan their campaign.\nCampaigning for the election will begin in January next year with the election itself being held between March 15 and 29.\nThe results will be announced at a declaration event on Friday, March 29, at council headquarters in Newtown St Boswells.\nTo register as a candidate, visit: elections.syp.org.uk/elections\nInformation is also available at: www.syp.org.uk and www.scotborders.gov.uk/syp\n"},{"url":null,"title":"borders-dad-delivers-baby-in-familys-sitting-room","story":"A RAIL worker from the Borders delivered his baby daughter in the family\u0026rsquos sitting room.\nGarry Kennan from Coldstream was guided through the birth by a Scottish Ambulance Service call taker.\nMum Vanessa was 40 weeks pregnant and a home birth had been scheduled for the new arrival.\nAs signs showed the birth was imminent on Tuesday, July 30 the couple\u0026rsquos other kids, Callum, 10, Charlotte, nine, and Caitlyn, five were dropped off at a relative\u0026rsquos house.\nAnd they were waiting anxiously for a midwife to arrive when baby Faith decided to make an appearance.\nGarry, a conductor team manager for ScotRail, today praised the Scottish Ambulance Service.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThings progressed very quickly and she went into labour before any healthcare professionals arrived.\n\u0026ldquoI was told by Borders General Hospital that a midwife was on the way.\nThe emergency call from Garry was made at 3.42pm, taken by Marianne McKeown.\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe call taker I spoke to was fantastic.\n\"She kept me calm when I was darting about like a headless chicken and talked me through everything.

service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.

The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.

But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-bmx-club-needs-helpers-today","story":"  An appeal on the club\u0027s Facebook page said: \"We are looking for a small army of volunteers to help finishing off the BMX track this Sunday from 10am.  \"This is a race standard track that will serve the cycling community of the Lothians for years to come and it has plenty to offer all levels of cyclists.  \"The layout with the heavy machinery is all done and now the manual surfacing is ready to go.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial. Its \u0026lsquolife expectancy\u0026rsquo is approximately 50 years."},{"url":null,"title":"famous-old-east-lothian-football-club-revived","story":"  The newly revived Wallyford Bluebell football team has already won the John Whyte Memorial Trophy, awarded to the champions of the five-a-side tournament hosted by Musselburgh Athletic Football Club at Olive Bank during the Musselburgh Festival.  Coach Rod Learmonth, who has been involved with Musselburgh Windsor Football Club, along with several of his ex-youth players from Wallyford, Musselburgh and Prestonpans, has restarted the new amateur team.  The team\u0026rsquos other coach is Chris Moffat, who used to play youth football for Musselburgh Windsor and, after a spell at St Johnstone, now plays for Dunbar United.  The pair are keen to find out more about the history of the Wallyford Bluebell club.  Mr Learmonth said: \u0026ldquoWe are reviving a famous old East Lothian side, Wallyford Bluebell FC.  \u0026ldquoWe have received lots of keen interest from people who once played for, or who have a member of their family who once played for, The Bluebell.  \u0026ldquoIdeally, we are hoping to attract all ages to come along and support our revival of this old club. Similarly, we\u0026rsquore very keen for any Courier readers to get in touch with us to give us details of their time at The Bluebell.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe majority of the current squad is made up from lads who have spent between five to 15 years playing youth football at Musselburgh Windsor.  \u0026ldquoThis band of brothers are excited at this new attempt to revive The Bluebell and would love to see some of the ex-players along to shout them on.  \u0026ldquoWe will be attempting to play all our home games at Wallyford playing fields, normally with a 2pm kick-off.  \u0026ldquoSo far we have played a few of the East Lothian sides in some friendlies and won every game.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe new housing is phased, which enables us to plan ahead.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment we are still looking at a range of options.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the focus on greater multi-disciplinary working coming in now with the new GP contract will allow patients much greater flexibility and swifter access to the right clinical professional at surgeries and other local settings.  Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is the same issues around working with a town that has got a good town square and you need to look at car parking.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at that in a measured way and working in partnership.  \u0026ldquoIt is the same with families with young children coming in and an ageing population.  \u0026ldquoYou have to look at schools and the health service as well."},{"url":null,"title":"pear-tree-nursery-set-to-create-up-to-30-jobs-in-haddington","story":"  Pear Tree Nursery has opened a second facility in the town in a former bed and breakfast on West Road.  The new nursery, which saw more than 200 interested parents attend its open day last month, could employ up to 30 staff when it is at capacity, with six already recruited.  Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.

He said: \u0026ldquoPear Tree Nursery has been doing a great job for many Haddington families in recent years \u0026ndash including my own grandsons. I have seen for myself on lots of occasions the great atmosphere in the existing nursery, and have watched that reflected in the many national awards Pear Tree has won for the quality of their provision.  \u0026ldquoI was delighted to help open the new Pear Tree on West Road. This is a beautiful building and it has been fitted out to provide the best of care. Not only will it increase the availability of childcare, but it will create a significant number of new jobs in the town too.  \u0026ldquoThis is now a highly qualified and professional sector, and Pear Tree has a great track record on staff support and training, so these are excellent opportunities for local people.  \u0026ldquoWith childcare entitlement expanding and Haddington also increasing in size, this is a much-needed and welcome facility."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.

If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington.

Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.

A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy.

With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed.

It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody!

Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5 (accumulate) this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent (12 per cent more than last year and the highest value in four years).  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"military-exercise-to-take-place-near-north-berwick","story":"  The exercise, run by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), takes place between September 3 and 21 at Gin Head, the former Second World War radar site at Tantallon, to the east of the town.

The investigation is into two complaints of incidents alleged to have taken place at Bute House, the First Minister\u0026rsquos official residence in 2013.  Ms Sturgeon said she agreed to the procedure covering ministers and former ministers in December 2017 but that while she was aware of the investigation she had no role in it.  Ms Sturgeon said that she was initially made aware of the investigation by Mr Salmond himself.

I\u0026rsquom not saying that journalists then could ever have been regarded as pillars of society fighting off invitations to join school boards and open local flower shows but they were accorded a degree of respect tinged with fear.  This was rooted in an acknowledgement that the newspaper game was a difficult one to enter (more so if the school you attended was named after a saint) and that you had access to privileged information and the secrets and lies of politicians and celebrities. In the West of Scotland you were assumed to have mastered the ability to retain and recall information even after a potentially life-changing quantum of alcohol had been consumed. We didn\u0026rsquot really know much about anything in particular but we knew a little about a lot and often that was just enough to persuade your lay friends and acquaintances that you were a polymath and a true lad o\u0026rsquo pairts.  There were good reasons why in England especially journalists were considered to be ideal fodder for Britain\u0026rsquos intelligence services: they seemed to move effortlessly among the salons of captains and kings without ever being considered members they thrived on conspiracies and were artful in the ways of extracting information from reluctant witnesses. It was well-known that the big English newspaper titles offered a means of decent employment for the \u0026lsquodifficult\u0026rsquo offspring of the aristocracy who were not considered to possess sufficient backbone for an officer career in the armed forces or the Conservative Party.  Rarely though, were newspaper journalists ever called to account for the opinions they offered and the stories they spun. The single letters page that existed in a newspaper was the exclusive preserve of retired teachers and military historians epistles critical of individual journalists were routinely spiked. In Scotland in 2018 the output of journalists, especially those who report on politics or football, are scrutinised and analysed to an extent unimaginable less than a generation ago.  Few of us can have any complaints. We are paid decently for the privilege of airing our grievances and indulging our preferences. Rarely do we stop to consider the effect our words can have on the targets of our prose and their families and when we do, we all too often reach for the \u0026ldquopublic interest justification a concept that possesses an astonishing measure of elasticity.  The last decade or so has borne witness to the most turbulent and dramatic period in modern Scotland\u0026rsquos political and constitutional history. The independence campaign will continue until another referendum and our relationship with Europe, which is also woven into the constitutional debate, will shape our economy and politics for another generation. Since 2005 there have been three Holyrood elections four UK elections, an independence referendum and a plebiscite on our membership of the European Union. It seems we are never far away from an election that will be \u0026ldquothe most important of modern times.  In another age newspapers would have increased pagination and staff numbers to cover these adequately in Scotland there has been a decrease in both. Into this huge deficit have come the tribunes of social media such as Wings Over Scotland, Bella Caledonia and an army of Twitter-users. In the mainstream media we harangue them and dismiss them for not playing to the long-accepted rules and conventions of form and language established by the newspaper elites over two centuries.  Jeremy Corbyn ventured into newspaper and media territory with his Alternative McTaggart lecture earlier this week. The leader of the opposition at Westminster made some salient points about our industry, although they might have carried more impact if he had agreed to answer some simple questions about his party\u0026rsquos failure in the last two years to construct a viable position on Brexit. Your primary obligation, Mr Corbyn is to oppose the main policies of the government of the day. For those of us who work in the Scottish media industry, though, his words carried little worth. As ever in these types of lectures this one was about another country and a different reality.  It occurred at a time when questions over the impartiality of the BBC on issues pertaining to Scottish independence have emerged once more. On the same day the corporation was forced into an embarrassing apology for its lop-sided interpretation of the latest GERS numbers. This came a few weeks after its bosses in London decided to have a tilt at the YouTube accounts of two prominent and influential independence bloggers. In addressing the BBC\u0026rsquos anointed and ridiculously protected and subsidised role in our national life Mr Corbyn failed to discuss the impact of its publicly-funded website on Scotland\u0026rsquos local newspaper sector. And when he talked about the narrow pattern of ownership among the UK\u0026rsquos biggest newspaper titles he stopped short of discussing the common thread that links them to the BBC: the hugely disproportionate numbers of privately-educated Oxbridge graduates who occupy their most influential positions.  When the second referendum on Scottish independence eventually happens, scrutiny of the conduct of our newspapers and broadcasters will eclipse that of the first one. Unionist supporters will seek to dismiss this as evidence of nastiness and division in Scottish society when they know it is nothing of the sort. Some of those on the Nationalist side of the debate will look for phantoms that don\u0026rsquot exist either, especially in the corridors of BBC Scotland. They need to exercise caution here. Aristocratic, Conservative and right-wing ownership of most of our national titles has existed for more than a century and in that time few financially viable proposals have emerged to dilute those interests.  By all means highlight whenever possible those instances when the bias of the owners is manifest. Loud campaigns to boycott the BBC or to intimidate and harass journalists on social media though, are not a good look to that crucial six per cent of the voting population who require to be persuaded that an independent Scotland is not a merciless place."},{"url":null,"title":"visa-refusal-denies-us-teacher-her-dream-scottish-job","story":"  Born in Harrisburg, the state capital of Pennsylvania, the 27-year-old has close family ties in Paisley, Renfrewshire, where her grandfather lived before emigrating in 1950.  With lots of second and third cousins in the city it seemed ideal when a teaching post was advertised in a Catholic primary school in nearby Glasgow.  After a successful interview, the usual background checks and an endorsement of her teaching credentials by the General Teaching Council for Scotland she had already started packing when the Home Office advised Glasgow City Council her visa had been rejected.  With her future in turmoil, Ms Farrell will now have to stay in America while the vacant post at St Angela\u0026rsquos Primary School, in Darnley, is re-advertised and she goes through the same visa process again.  \u0026ldquoIt was a dream come true for me to be allowed to enter Scotland to teach. My family is from Scotland so for me this almost feels like coming home, she said.  \u0026ldquoMy paternal grandparents are originally from Paisley and that was the the main reason for my desire to go abroad and teach. I thought I would be coming full-circle if I could return to their home country and teach in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThis is a goal that I have been working towards for over a year and I have invested a lot of time and money into this process. I also resigned from my teaching post in Virginia and moved my life back to my parents\u0026rsquo house before the move to Scotland.  \u0026ldquoDue to this setback it seems that I am in limbo, living back home with my parents without a job. It is still my goal to come to Scotland, and I am hopeful that it will happen because I know I can be an asset. I just need someone to give me that chance.  Despite widespread teacher vacancies across Scotland and a particular shortage of approved Catholics in the denominational sector, Ms Farrell was declined under the complex Home Office points based system.  Because the Westminster Government\u0026rsquos monthly immigration cap has already been reached it means all applicants are judged against each other on a set of criteria - including salary levels.  Those in occupations where there are shortages, such as the medical sector, are given priority with the rest of the places allocated according to factors such as level of salary or qualifications.  Teaching is currently not viewed as a shortage occupation and does not command the same sort of salaries as other professions.  Glasgow City Council has now re-advertised the post with the hope that the visa application will be successful at the second attempt.  Ms Farrell is also hopeful she will be soon be able to pursue her dream move.  She said: \u0026ldquoI was heartbroken when I received word that my sponsorship had been refused, but I am very fortunate that Glasgow has not given up on me and they still are going to reapply for the sponsorship.  A spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council said: \u0026ldquoFollowing a successful interview the teacher has been offered a job in Glasgow and we will do everything in our power to help her secure the correct documentation in order to teach.  A Home Office spokeswoman said the government recognised the contribution of international teachers, but the immigration system was designed to ensure employers \u0026ldquolooked first to the UK resident labour market before recruiting from overseas.  She added: \u0026ldquoWhen demand exceeds the monthly available allocation of places, priority is given to applicants filling a shortage or PhD-level occupation.  \u0026ldquoNo occupation on the shortage occupation list \u0026ndash which is based on advice by the independent Migration Advisory Committee \u0026ndash has been refused a place.  The Home Office is currently looking at creating more flexibility in the system by creating a specific category for doctors and nurses which will free up more places for other occupations.  Research by The Herald earlier this month revealed there were nearly 700 teacher vacancies at primaries and secondaries across Scotland.  Councils facing some of the most acute shortages include those in the North East such as Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray, but there were also shortages in Glasgow.  Teaching unions argue the main problem is pay and conditions with the increasing workload of staff putting off recruits at a time when salaries have declined in real terms.  Glasgow also has an issue with the number of teachers with Catholic approval in its denominational sector.  It is not uncommon for there to be at least 40 teachers working in the sector who don\u0026rsquot have approval every year because of the wider shortages.  In 2016 Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, president of the Catholic Education Commission, said there would be \u0026lsquosignificant consequences\u0026rsquo for Catholic education should the \u0026lsquoacute\u0026rsquo problem not be addressed."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-under-pressure-to-suspend-alex-salmond-amid-allegations","story":"  Mr Salmond repeatedly denied criminal behaviour and insisted he has never sexually harassed anyone as he battled to save his reputation following explosive claims dating back to his time as First Minister.  It came as it emerged Ms Sturgeon refused to intervene in the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos internal investigation when Mr Salmond told her about the allegations earlier this year.  She said the claims were \u0026ldquoextremely difficult to come to terms with but could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.  An internal Government probe was launched in January after two staff members complained of sexual misconduct by Mr Salmond at Bute House in December 2013, when he was First Minister.  In an extraordinary day for Scottish politics, Mr Salmond revealed he met Ms Sturgeon three times after being told of the claims, during which he raised concerns about the \u0026ldquofundamentally flawed investigation into his behaviour.  Ms Sturgeon said she had \u0026ldquomade very clear she would not intervene.  The former First Minister is now taking the Scottish Government to court over its handling of the complaints process, and has demanded an inquiry into how details were leaked to a newspaper.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos shadow equalities secretary Monica Lennon said: \u0026ldquoGiven the serious nature of these allegations, it would be appropriate that the SNP suspends Alex Salmond\u0027s membership of the party with immediate effect.  In a statement released on Thursday night, Mr Salmond accused the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, of carrying out a \u0026ldquogrossly unfair investigation into the claims, branding some of them \u0026ldquopatently ridiculous.  But Ms Evans said his statement contained \u0026ldquosignificant inaccuracies. She also revealed Mr Salmond attempted to gag her from publicising the complaints by issuing legal proceedings.  Mr Salmond is now pursuing a judicial review of her probe, and insisted that if he wins \u0026ldquothere will be serious questions to answer at the top of government.  During a lengthy press conference, he refused to detail the nature of the allegations against him, whether he was anticipating more claims or whether complaints had previously been made about his behaviour as First Minister.  He also refused to say whether he had suggested to Ms Sturgeon that the Government\u0026rsquos investigation be dropped, instead answering: \u0026ldquoPrivate conversations as far as I\u0026rsquom concerned are private conversations.  \u0026ldquoWhat I would say is the very legitimate concerns, reservations, arguments about the nature of this, I have made to everybody at every possible opportunity.  Mr Salmond did not rule out suing Ms Evans or the Scottish Government for defamation after the current legal proceedings have finished.  He said he is \u0026ldquono saint and has made \u0026ldquomany mistakes in my life \u0026ndash political and personal, but denied sexual harassment or criminality.  The former politician said his family and friends \u0026ndash including his wife of almost four decades, Moira \u0026ndash had been \u0026ldquoincredibly supportive.  He insisted it was made \u0026ldquoexplicit to him when the Scottish Government launched its probe that it would be \u0026ldquototally confidential. But this was breached, he argued, when Ms Evans told him on Wednesday afternoon that she was making the claims public.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos only through a fair process that you can get a fair result. In the procedure of the Scottish Government, I had no access to evidence, witness statements. I was denied the right to speak to any serving civil servant.  Asked if he thought he would be suspended from the SNP, Mr Salmond said: \u0026ldquoI would advise everybody to suspend judgment until the court can make a judgment.  He said he did his \u0026ldquoabsolute best to cooperate with the civil service investigation, but had only seen a summary of the complaints against him and was not told the identity of the alleged victims.  But he insisted he was not seeking any sympathy. He said: \u0026ldquoIf I lose at the Court of Session then as I said, I\u0026rsquoll have to answer the complaints openly and publicly and I\u0026rsquoll do that as far as I\u0026rsquom able, with confidentiality and all that.  \u0026ldquoBut I don\u0026rsquot expect to lose. I expect to win. And that will have serious implications for the top administrators in the Scottish Government, but it might have beneficial consequences for a better process in the future.  Ms Sturgeon said Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos membership of the SNP would be \u0026ldquoconsidered in the fullness of time as more information became available.  A police spokesman said: \"We are carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and enquiries are at an early stage."},{"url":null,"title":"catalan-leader-carles-puigdemont-arrives-in-scotland-to-talk-about-independence","story":"  Mr Puigdemont was making his first trip outside Belgium since his international arrest warrant was lifted by the Spanish Authorities.

He said at the time: \u0026ldquoThis is not the end of the journey. I will travel to the last corner of Europe to defend the just cause of the Catalan people.

But senior Labour figures defended the party leader, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying he had devoted his life to securing peace in the Middle East.  Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme: \u0026ldquoI think this has all been taken out of context: whatever Jeremy has said throughout the years has always been about how to secure peace, particularly within the Middle East and also peace with justice for all concerned \u0026ndash both members of the Jewish community and also members of the Palestinian community.  \u0026ldquoIn that context Jeremy has devoted his life, so I think this would take expressions out of context in that way are not helping.

The WMOF pastoral congress has seen tens of thousands of people from over 110 countries flood through the doors of the Royal Society Dublin, however it is an event that has been overshadowed by the Catholic Church\u0026rsquos treatment of sex abuse survivors.  Pope Francis has said he will meet with victims of clerical sex abuse in private when he visits, however other survivors, campaigners and the wider public will be waiting to hear whether he will address these issues in public.  It comes after abuse victim Marie Collins told a session on safeguarding children at the WMOF members of clergy and lay people in the Catholic Church believe abuse scandals are a \u0026ldquomedia conspiracy.  Earlier this week, Pope Francis wrote a 2,000-word letter to Catholics in which he condemned the crime of sexual abuse by priests and subsequent cover-ups.  The Pope demanded accountability in response to new revelations in the United States of decades of misconduct by the Catholic Church.  Speaking about the letter, Ms Collins said: \u0026ldquoSurvivors and victims of abuse don\u0026rsquot need a letter from the Pope to know this is a reality.

Two further national assemblies are due to take place in Aviemore in the Highlands and Edinburgh next month, ahead of the SNP\u0027s autumn conference in October.  SNP depute leader Keith Brown, chair of the assemblies, said: \"I\u0027m delighted that the first national assembly event attracted so many people and generated such a range of positive ideas and contributions on the sustainable growth commission report.  \"This is so valuable as we build a fresh case for an independent Scotland.\"  The Growth Commission, set up by Nicola Sturgeon and chaired by former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, set out a series of recommendations for the economy in an independent Scotland.  Its proposals include keeping Sterling without a formal currency union after Scotland leaves the UK.  A separate Scottish currency could be set up after a period of about a decade, but only if six key economic tests were met, the commission said.  The move would see the Bank of England continue to set interest rates and other monetary policy in the years after independence.  The commission also said it would take 10 years to get Scotland\u0027s deficit rate under control while an independent Scotland would take up to 25 years to match the economic performance of other small countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and New Zealand.  The First Minister has insisted the report sets out an alternative to Westminster\u0027s \"austerity\" but the document has been criticised by some Yes supporters.  Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland ahead of the meeting in Ayr, Mr Brown said the commission had presented a \"very realistic hard-headed approach\", but he added \"of course it may be the case that members of the party have a different point of view and that\u0027s why we\u0027re having these national assemblies\".  Challenged on some members\u0027 objections to retaining Sterling, Mr Brown added: \"I can say from the meetings I\u0027ve had so far, there are some views along those lines in terms of the currency - people not happy with sticking with the pound for that period of time.  \"But that would be a minority in the discussions I\u0027ve had so far, and we\u0027ll find out what the strength of feeling is (at the national assembly).\""},{"url":null,"title":"brewdog told to pay sacked worker 12k","story":"        A former employee of Ellon-based brewers, BrewDog, has won his employment tribunal case after being sacked because he was losing his eyesight!

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Saturday 25 Aug 2018 3:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Saturday 25 Aug 2018 3:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire. QinetiQ employs 6000 staff and has a turnover of around \u0026pound700 million.The deal comes as AMTE Power has invested \u0026pound1.5 million in a new automated production line at its Caithness operation.John Fox, the company\u0026rsquos marketing director, yesterday described the partnership agreement as \u0026ldquoa positive step for AMTE Power and the local economy.He explained the two business will work together to develop battery cells.\u0026ldquoWe will use our manufacturing expertise to utilise QinetiQ\u0026rsquos experience in battery technology and research to deliver new products, manufactured in Thurso to an international customer base, Mr Fox said.He said the companies will concentrate on four key areas: defence, the oil and gas industry, energy storage and electric vehicles. They plan to supply UK and European markets with niche batteries which customers would not be able to get elsewhere.Mr Fox said there is potential and opportunities in these areas and the increase in the Thurso workforce will be largely due to the link-up with QinetiQ.The partnership deal, he stressed, will allow customers to get products which \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot rely on standard mass-produced cells from the existing supply chain.The agreement will enable the companies to develop \u0026ldquoa mutually beneficial relationship and lead to advances in batteries and energy storage products.\u0026ldquoOur staff in Thurso are fantastic and we will continue to grow our base there, he said. \u0026ldquoWe have 32 employees in Caithness at present but have plans for that figure to go up to 40 over the next year \u0026ndash that is a 25 per cent increase.\u0026ldquoThis is a great building block for the future development of the organisation.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald (vice-chairman), Catherine Patterson (secretary) and Garance Warburton (treasurer).Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Saturday 25 Aug 2018 3:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Made with footage culled from up to 240 cameras that captured both the initial launch and the nine-day mission that followed, the film is a vital scientific document, a portrait of late \u0026#821760s America and a visually cogent exploration of man\u0026#8217s place in the universe.With an original score by Charles Morrow and a commanding narration by Laurence Luckinbill, the documentary won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival. However, for the next few decades, it was practically forgotten even the original printing elements were lost.Christopher Riley is a film producer, director and writer specialising in science, engineering and history. His work has been celebrated by BAFTA, the US Television Academy, the Royal Television Society, the Sundance Institute and the Grierson Trust.He is a regular contributor to  newspaper and presents science documentaries for BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he tracked down Theo Kamecke — who was working as a sculptor in upstate New York — and found that he held the only remaining 35mm print. Working closely with Theo, Moonwalk One was re-mastered, combining a unique 35mm director’s cut with newly transferred 16mm NASA flight film media, to create a new HD digital master of the film.This will be the first chance to see the new high-definition Blu-ray version of the film which is due to be released next year.Moonwalk One: The Director\u0026#8217s Cut is on at West Side Cinema, Stromness Town Hall, Saturday, September 8 at 7.45pm. The film has been programmed to coincide with #skyranMOON and the Museum Of The Moon at Stromness Academy.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although the provision of public toilets is a non-statutory function of local authorities, the Scottish Government ensured that the criteria for the fund did include capital support for toilet provision, where there was a demonstrable need.\"She added that she was aware of the council\u0026rsquos toilet closure plans and said she had \"personally pressed\" the local authority to reconsider.Council leader Margaret Davidson said the cuts were part of wider measures to \"balance the budget and safeguard essential services\" amid a climate of reduced funding for councils across Scotland and the wider UK.What do YOU think?

Her cooking was what initially drew clients to come to the centre and her baking, he said, was \"legendary\".This theme was echoed by speeches from Ina Mackenzie, Mina Stewart and Kerry Watson. Laela Maclean composed a poem which reminisced and poked good-natured fun at Cis\u0026rsquos life in Lochcarron and the Centre.Cis\u0026rsquos husband Sandy kept the feet tapping with musical interludes on his accordion \u0026mdash including one tune called Christine Ross of Lochcarron, initially written for Cis by the late Iain Crichton, from Stornoway.Christine Houser, Donar MacIver and his son, Stephen MacIver sang Gaelic songs \u0026mdash the eyes of some of the older guests lighting up as they joined in the choruses.Cis was aided by Morag MacCuish to cut her retirement cake which had been made by Harry Gow, her favourite baker. She made a speech thanking everyone for their presence and for the gifts she had received from the clients, staff and board members.The event provided a lovely send-off for Cis. The afternoon ended with everyone joining hands to sing Auld Lang Syne accompanied musically, as in life, by her husband Sandy.Saturday 25 Aug 2018 3:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre. Their volunteers have worked really hard to achieve this. We are delighted to see this investment in their project, which recognises a very important aspect of the heritage of our area.\"Saturday 25 Aug 2018 3:44 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider variety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs.

Smart Metering Systems (SMS), which connects, owns, operates and maintains energy metering assets and databases, has inked the tie-up with renewable energy supplier Good Energy.            Good Energy, based in Wiltshire, has more than 250,000 customers across the UK, adding to the 2 million-plus customers already served by SMS.             Under the terms of the agreement, SMS will supply domestic smart meters as part of the UK government’s rollout programme, which requires that domestic energy supply companies provide their customers with a smart meter to use in their homes and small businesses by 2020.SMS will provide new “SMETS 2” smart meters to monitor energy usage, which have a user-friendly advantage over the previous SMETS 1 model, as they allow customers to switch suppliers without changing meters. The majority of smart meters soon to be installed under the main phase of the government’s rollout scheme will be SMETS 2.  Alan Foy, chief executive officer at SMS, which is quoted on the alternative investment market (AIM), said: “We are delighted to be working with Good Energy as their exclusive supplier, one of the UK’s leading suppliers of energy from renewable sources, in the rollout of their smart meter programme. “Good Energy have over 250,000 customers across the UK, SMS is well positioned to support them with the smart meter rollout given our strong track record for customer services and asset ownership and management.”            John Maltby, Good Energy chairman, said the partnership would lead to a good user experience for the supplier’s customers. He said: “We are pleased to announce our partnership with SMS as the chosen supplier of our new SMETS 2 meters, as part of the UK government programme to roll out smart meters to UK energy customers.“Good Energy is focused on making sure smart meters work for the renewable energy sector. “Partnering with SMS gives us the ability to provide our customers with a market-leading smart meter, and associated products, which will enhance user experience.”            This is the latest deal for SMS, which signed a meter rental agreement in February with Utilita Energy to provide more than 100,000 meters throughout the year.The firm in March upped its dividend by more than a quarter despite a dip in pre-tax profits.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

People from every corner of the globe have made the United States of America their home.            There are up to 25 million Scots Americans, a further 30 million Scots-Irish, three-and-a-half million – and rising – new Americans from India.            The biggest cohort are German-Americans, with 46 million people claiming German ancestry. Including, of course, one Donald J Trump, whose grandfather came from Bavaria.Though, for reasons known only to himself, the President claimed for years that his father’s family were Swedish.Folk from Malawi, from Nepal, from Ukraine have settled here, and despite Trump’s best efforts, people keep coming, lured by the shining promise of the American dream.And then there are five million Native Americans, or American Indians as many prefer to be called, a people whose ancient way of life was all but destroyed when white settlers from Europe decided to make the fertile lands of North America their home.Around a quarter now live on “the rez”, land managed by tribal elders. The rest gradually migrated to the cities such as New York, Minneapolis or Denver.            Life is tough for many of America’s native people. One in ten die from alcohol-related illness. Thirty per cent live in poverty, with the number rising to nearly 90 per cent in some reservations.And there is a dearth of Native American role models to match the cultural and political impact of Beyoncé and Barack Obama.Major, a Northern Cheyenne, lives in Helena, the small, but beautiful capital of Montana. “Welcome to our shop,” he smiles as we climb the stairs to the Sage and Oats Trading Post.We look around quickly, at the traditional Cheyenne drums, the hand-made dolls, the cans of Irn-Bru.            “Irn-Bru?” laughs my husband, as he pokes the display, suspiciously. He’s from Stoke.“We get it online,” explains Michelle, Major’s vivacious wife, who is Irish Scots American. “Larkin on one side, and Campbell on the other,” she explains.“It sells well, one of the local attorneys really likes it, comes in for regular supplies. Does it really cure hangovers?” she laughs.READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: The city that celebrates 72 hours without a fatal shootingMichelle and Major’s shop showcases the best of America. “We have gathered a collection of all the different goods that celebrate the diversity and history of Montana,” explains Michelle. “Yes, even Irn-Bru.”            “That’s what’s so great about our country. It was built on immigration, on people from all over the world coming together to build a new one. We want to celebrate that. Our slogan is let’s be different together.”As talk turned to Trump and illegal aliens, Major, laughing, said, “If my people had been able to choose which new settlers were allowed in, as the government does now, then maybe things would have been much better for all of us.”If he had been working for the Cheyenne Homeland Security in the 1800s, he may well have stopped people from my ancestral home, Ireland, from entering, and with good reason.“General Custer’s army was made up largely of Irish and German enlisted men,” boomed the park ranger at the site of the Battle of Little Bighorn, a few miles south of Helena.“Many could not speak English, but they had been told it was their God-given right to move west.“And the Lakota warriors were determined to protect their families, and their ancient way of life. Everyone involved thought they were fighting for the right reasons.”It is hard to feel too much sympathy for the Kelly, O’Connor and McElroy boys who had escaped their own colonial masters, only to help steal land from the Lakota people.But standing on Last Stand Hill, where 260 soldiers were killed one sunny June day in 1876, I can almost feel their fear as they faced certain death at the hands of Sitting Bull’s triumphant army of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors.Custer’s last stand turned out to be the last stand for Sitting Bull too. He surrendered to the US Army five years after his famous victory and was killed by the police at the Standing Rock reservation in 1890.The violent death of warriors such as Limber Bones and Closed Hand at Little Bighorn turned out to be a pointless sacrifice as their people retreated to the reservations. A noble people, who had once roamed freely across America, were now strangers in their own land.READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: Embrace legacy of Otis and Elvis in the name of freedomAs we left Little Bighorn, we drove through the Crow Reservation. The scattered, shabby mobile home communities we saw were a far cry from the tribe’s ancestral villages, full of beautifully decorated tipis.The reservation’s main source of income, the Absaloka coal mine, has all but disappeared. Last year, two thirds of the pit’s workers were laid off, forcing Crow leaders to lobby President Trump to ease environmental rules and extend the Indian coal tax breaks.“I don’t want to be that poor again that I will live on deer meat,” said one after a meeting at the White House.But it seems Trump has more pressing matters to consider than the future of the Crow Nation.“All the President’s men are crooked!” shrieked a veteran political commentator on Tuesday night. And, for once, MSNBC’s Chris Matthews was not guilty of hyperbole.Within minutes of each other, Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen had admitted eight fraud charges and his ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty on eight more.Both men face long prison terms. And both men could bring down Trump.Cohen has already started singing, implicating the President in campaign finance fraud, and he seems desperate to share even more of Trump’s guilty secrets. Manafort, in his prison cell, has so far remained resolutely tight-lipped.The White House insists the President did nothing wrong, and his latest lawyer, the loquacious Rudy Giuliani, bellows from a Scottish golf course: “He’s innocent!”The history of modern America is strewn with stories of heroes and villains. From Sitting Bull to Richard Nixon, Martin Luther King to Joe McCarthy.Its people fled from war, persecution and poverty to build the world’s biggest economy. They survived a bloody civil war. They overcame segregation. They put the first man on the moon.But can the American dream survive the nightmare that is Donald J Trump?"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4789748.1535206189!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp holds first national assembly to debate scottish independence blueprint","story":"        About 400 people have attended the first of several SNP events being held to debate a new economic blueprint for independence.                The national assembly meeting was held in Ayr, South Ayrshire, on Saturday to gather party members’ views on the findings of the Growth Commission, published in May.            Two further national assemblies are due to take place in Aviemore in the Highlands and Edinburgh next month, ahead of the SNP’s autumn conference in October.            SNP depute leader Keith Brown, chair of the assemblies, said: “I’m delighted that the first national assembly event attracted so many people and generated such a range of positive ideas and contributions on the sustainable growth commission report.“This is so valuable as we build a fresh case for an independent Scotland.”The Growth Commission, set up by Nicola Sturgeon and chaired by former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, set out a series of recommendations for the economy in an independent Scotland.Its proposals include keeping Sterling without a formal currency union after Scotland leaves the UK.A separate Scottish currency could be set up after a period of about a decade, but only if six key economic tests were met, the commission said.            The move would see the Bank of England continue to set interest rates and other monetary policy in the years after independence.The commission also said it would take 10 years to get Scotland’s deficit rate under control while an independent Scotland would take up to 25 years to match the economic performance of other small countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and New Zealand.The First Minister has insisted the report sets out an alternative to Westminster’s “austerity” but the document has been criticised by some Yes supporters.Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland ahead of the meeting in Ayr, Mr Brown said the commission had presented a “very realistic hard-headed approach”, but he added “of course it may be the case that members of the party have a different point of view and that’s why we’re having these national assemblies”.            Challenged on some members’ objections to retaining Sterling, Mr Brown added: “I can say from the meetings I’ve had so far, there are some views along those lines in terms of the currency - people not happy with sticking with the pound for that period of time.“But that would be a minority in the discussions I’ve had so far, and we’ll find out what the strength of feeling is (at the national assembly).”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday.

Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils philanthropy boosts five charities ","story":"Several charities benefited to the tune of £3,000 each thanks to a schools\u0026#8217 philanthropy scheme.\nThe Youth and Philanthropy Initiative (YPI) takes place across Scotland with pupils working together to decide which organisation to hand the cash to.\nAn entire year group takes part in YPI.

A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nSaturday 25 Aug 2018 3:44 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ORKAMBI-HANNAH-MCDIARMID-2.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8610896.1535013057!/image/image.jpg","title":"10 new jobs set to be created with the opening of intersport in antrim","story":"\nGlobal sports retailer, Intersport is set to open a new store at The Junction in Antrim, creating up to 10 new jobs. \n\n                \nIntersport has announced a significant £250,000 investment at the retail and leisure park, which will see the global brand open its doors in September, occupying a 5,600 sq ft unit next to Tom Tailor and O’Briens.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe new store is part of an ongoing £30 million redevelopment plan at the Antrim-based shopping centre and follows recent developments including the construction of a new McDonald’s restaurant and the arrival of the Beauty Outlet, the UK’s fastest growing beauty retailer. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIntersport is one of the world’s largest sports retailers and innovators in Sportswear, with over 5,500 stores, 220 of which are located in the UK. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe brand prides itself on providing active wear for all ages and abilities, from beginners to athletes, and will house an array of popular sporting brands including Adidas, Under Armour, Puma, Canterbury, ProTouch and Speedo.\n\n Alastair Coulson, Managing Director for Lotus Property said: “The arrival of Intersport is a welcome addition to the centre and further complements our growing portfolio of retail and leisure brands.\n\n“Building on other recent developments, including the arrival of The Beauty Outlet and the commencement of building work for McDonald’s, this marks another important milestone in our £30m Master Plan for The Junction.” \n\nPadraic McKeever, Managing Director of Sports Merchandising Ireland, which holds the Intersport franchise, added: “This latest store opening at The Junction is an exciting moment for Intersport. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The Intersport mission is to inspire and connect with the everyday athlete through sport and we can’t wait to work with the team at The Junction to spread this message to the people of Antrim and beyond.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":null,"title":"a level success at slemish college","story":"\nSlemish College is celebrating A Level exams success with 97% of students achieving three A Levels, with 83% of grades were at C or above. \n\n                \nThere were some outstanding individual achievements and over a third of grades were A or A*.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe majority of A levels subjects achieved 100% A*-C including Art, Hospitality and Catering, Business Studies, Further Maths,  Computing, Chemistry, Biology, English Literature, Health and Social Care, Media Studies, Physics, Environmental Technology, Sport, and Construction.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nActing Principal Mr Michael Bennett said: “All our students should feel very proud of their endeavours and we particularly want to thank our A2 students for all that they have contributed to Slemish College. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“We wish you well in future endeavours and know you will achieve amazing things.

It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

And it’s an ideal venue to host birthday parties and school or group outings.”\n\nAir-tastic currently has two trampoline parks, located in Bangor and Cork, with a number of other Air-tastic trampoline parks planned to open in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in due course. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor further information on Air-tastic and the Craigavon trampoline park opening visit www.air-tastic or search Air-tastic Craigavon on Facebook.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602227.1534344744!/image/image.jpg","title":"can you help a history project","story":"\nDid you ever work in the old Mayfair manufacturing company in Portadown? If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority (EA) has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the

for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

This is the first time the event has been staged in Ireland.\nPope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday, almost 40 years since Pope John Paul II came and addressed the faithful at capacity Masses in Drogheda, Knock and Phoenix Park. Pope Francis’ first engagement will be meeting President Michael D Higgins before visiting St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and then the Capuchin Day Centre, which provides hot meals, clothing and showers for the city’s homeless. Pope Francis will then preside at the Festival of Families in Croke Park.\nHis visit will conclude on Sunday with a closing Mass at Phoenix Park. An estimated 500,000 people are expected to attend with thousands more watching the live footage from around the world.\nRector of Clonard Monastery Fr Noel Kehoe said that the parish is running a bus to the weekend events in Dublin “on Friday” and that he will be staying “to attend both the festival of Families and attend the Papal Mass”.\nParish Manager at St Oliver Plunkett Parish Glen Phillips told the Andersonstown News that Pope Francis’ visit had created “such a buzz within the parish”.\n“We have a coach leaving tomorrow (Thursday) so that parishioners can attend the WMOF Congress in the RDS.\n“A number of families from the parish will also be attending the Festival of Families in Croke Park on Saturday and we are also running a coach to the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park on Sunday.\n “There is such a buzz around the parish as the Papal visit approaches. Many older parishioners remember Pope John Paul II’s visit and many young parishioners were brought up on stories about it. Pope Francis is re-invigorating the Church and many parishioners want to be part of that and show support for him,” he said.\nSt John’s Church was proudly displaying its bunting and Papal flags as parishioners filed out from Mass on Wednesday morning. Parish Manager Conor Neeson explained how some of the decorations had stood the test of time and dated back to John Paul II’s visit.\n“We will have a number of buses on from Friday morning taking parishioners down to Dublin for the Pope’s visit. As part of the Falls Road Pastoral Community, parishioners from Corpus Christi, St John’s, St Mary’s, St Paul’s and St Peter’s Cathedral will all be travelling this weekend. There is a great sense of occasion and I’ll be staying behind to organise the parish hall for the Mass on Sunday as we will be screening it live,” he said.\nChair of the Pastoral Council Annette Hinchcliffe said she will be attending the Mass along with her teenage children and had also been part of history when she travelled down on the train to see John Paul II say Mass in 1979.\n“Many of our elderly population in the parish would have loved to have attended the Mass on Sunday but a lot of the instructions about once people get off their buses is the walk to Phoenix Park which is a possible three miles. We thought it would be nice to bring everyone together to give them a flavour of the day so that they wouldn’t just be watching it in the house. Our parishioners will have an opportunity to come to the parish centre to watch the Mass and be with the other people in their parish,” she said.\nParishioner Frances McEvoy told us: “I’m going down today (Wednesday) for the different discussions and events that are taking place over the next couple of days each day ending with a Mass and I’m looking forward to enjoying the weekend celebrations as well.\n“I was in Phoenix Park whenever John Paul II came and I think this Pope has the same charisma. I think he will be very welcomed despite all that is going on at the minute.\n“It’s very exciting. I was in Rome before Christmas staying with friends and I was at one of his meetings, when he meets the people on a Wednesday. The atmosphere when he walks in is just incredible. There is definitely  something about him. I think despite in terms of some of the negative publicly there has been around the visit he will speak to the people and he speaks from his heart,” she said.\nAt an extremely busy The Holy Shop in city centre’s Chapel Lane sales assistants Maura McShane and Teresa Nolan told us how there had been “great interest” in their Pope Francis memorabilia ahead of the highly anticipated visit.\n“We have rosary beads, candles, framed photos of Pope Francis and prayer cards all to mark his visit for the World Meeting of Families,” explained Teresa. “He is a very popular Pope and the amount of our customers going this weekend to see him is unreal,” she said.\nMaura said that many people were calling in since staff created their window display and there was a real “excitement” with people ahead of the weekend.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"all the traffic and travel details ahead of the popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They had everything they wanted.\" \n\nMr Currie was brought up in Coalisland, an overwhelmingly nationalist town. \n\nHe was elected as a Nationalist MP for East Tyrone from 1964 until 1972, and was one of the founders of the SDLP.\n\nHe moved to the Republic in 1989 and was Fine Gael TD for Dublin West.\n\nIn June 1968 Mr Currie and others occupied a house in Caledon, Co Tyrone, in protest at the discriminatory allocation of houses by the local council. \n\nWhen he saw a 19-year-old girl \"who happened to be a Protestant and a unionist\" and \"worked at a unionist politician\u0027s solicitor\u0027s office\" being allocated a home ahead of 269 others on the waiting list, he said he felt compelled to take action. \n\n\"I just felt it was unfair, unjust, intolerable and something had to be done, and I did it,\" he said. \n\nMr Currie said he made the decision to organise the march after taking part in the protests against the housing situation, hoping the event would be similar to those witnessed in the southern states of the United States. Two months after that march, another civil rights protest ended in violent scenes when police clashed with protesters in Londonderry. \n\nMr Currie said organisers had actually been disappointed with the numbers that turned out for the march, which had been banned, yet he said it has since become one of the catalysts for the entire civil rights movement here. \n\n\"The RUC acted absolutely stupidly and in front of the television cameras, particularly RTE, they ran awry, they ran mad and it was on the television and was seen around the world and that really effectively gave the boost which became the very successful civil rights movement,\" he said. \n\nThe former TD said he regretted the loss of lives during the Troubles that ensued afterwards. \n\n\"It wasn\u0027t inevitable that it would happen,\" he said, insisting non-violence was at the heart of the civil rights movement. It was very unfortunate and was not inevitable. But I wish it hadn\u0027t happened.\"\n\nMr Currie added: \"The civil rights campaign was an extremely successful organisation and it actually changed the whole political scene as far as Northern Ireland was concerned, and of course I don\u0027t regret that.\" \n\nHe criticised the current power-sharing impasse at Stormont. He said it was a \"totally hypocritical situation\" that elected representatives were being paid when the Assembly was not sitting. \n\nVeteran DUP man Nelson McCausland has a very different interpretation of the civil rights movement. \n\nThe former Stormont minister said: \"It may be the anniversary of the first civil rights march but he said it was certainly not their first appearance on the streets in that they had been out in Easter in 1968 against the banning of the republican Easter Rising parade. \n\n\"That in a sense was part of the problem, that right from the start the civil rights movement was so closely aligned with Irish nationalism and republicanism.\" \n\nHe said the movement was \"never going to be a place that was welcoming to unionists\".\n\nHe added: \"The tragedy is that it led on eventually to a situation which broke out into violence that led to more than 3,000 people dead.\" \n\nThe former MLA claimed that there are a lot of inaccuracies when it came to the housing statistics from the time.\n\n\"Much of what was put forward as fact to justify claims of discrimination was actually manipulated,\" he claimed. \n\nHe said there were some examples where there was an \"unbalance\" but he maintained that overall there was a \"fairly reasonable\" spread of council housing going to Catholic and Protestants at the time. \n\n\"It\u0027s not the picture that was portrayed at the time,\" he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"eleanors the one for gareth after he pops the question at kodaline gig","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It turns out he\u0027d gone to Custom House Square to make sure everything was going to go as he planned.\"\n\nIt\u0027s been two years, three months and four days since the couple first met at the Balmoral Show in May 2016, and they clicked shortly afterwards when they were paired up with a restaurant voucher during a charity \u0027Take Me Out\u0027 night in Strabane.\n\n\"He\u0027s never been the sort of person to do stunts like this,\" said Eleanor. \"He works on the family dairy farm with his brothers so it was very unexpected.\n\n\"It took a lot of convincing for me to get to the concert, but my best friend Rachel Nelson from Ballyclare was in on this from the start and persuaded me I had to go with her. She was the only other person he\u0027d told.\n\n\"Gareth was frantically texting at the start of the concert. I wondered who he was sending messages to but Rachel told me not to be so nosy.\n\n\"Then they told me I\u0027d won a competition to go back stage so I was lined up there with Gareth at the side of the stage as the band started to play \u0027The One\u0027.\n\n\"It turns out he\u0027d gone to buy the engagement ring that morning and had everything planned.

We would remind all our customers that opening a manhole and putting anything down it is forbidden. By doing this, you are obstructing a working sewer which is designed to take waste away from homes. Incidents like this cause out of sewer flooding and require valuable time and resources to resolve,\" she said.\n\nShe urged people to dispose of their fat, oil and grease properly. \n\n“While most homes and businesses use grease traps and bin their waste correctly, those that don’t, contributed to a massive fatberg in the sewers around the area,\" Mrs McCullagh said\n\n“We would appeal to all our customers, especially food outlets, to dispose of their fat, oil and grease appropriately. For householders, let it cool and then put it into the bin. Alternatively, pour it into a disposable container and take it to your local oil bank.\n\n“Businesses also risk blocking their own drainage systems, which results in extra costs being incurred in clean-up efforts. These fat blockages can not only result in out of sewer flooding, but odour problems and the risk of rat infestations both near and beyond your premises. Ways to dispose of FOG include fitting a grease trap, using an enzyme dosing system or recycling it.\"\n\nMrs McCullagh said the fatberg was having a negative affect on the whole community.\n\n“We have all seen the disgusting effects of an overflowing manhole in the street and no one wants to see or smell it (not even us!) but the reality is, it happens regularly at a cost of millions to NI Water each year,\" he said.\n\n“We all have the power to stop it. In the last ten years, NI Water has spent over £1.5 billion investing in water and wastewater infrastructure but no amount of investment will completely stop blocked pipes if people continue to flush wipes (including flushable), sanitary items and cotton buds down the toilet.”\n\nShe urged people to properly dispose of sanitary products.\n\n“According to recent research carried out by Water UK, 93% of the material causing sewer blockages was made up of wipes - including a high proportion of baby wipes - which are not designed to be flushed. Less than 1% of the domestic waste in the blockages was identified as made up of products which are designed to be flushed, such as toilet paper.\n\n“Customer awareness and behaviour change is the only real way to address sewer misuse it’s simple really, don’t flush anything other than paper, poo and pee.\n\n“Visit \nwww.niwater\n for further information.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"methody in his madness after head walks 150 miles to school in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The school opened three years later.\n\nTo mark the milestone, Mr Naismith began his walk from McArthur\u0027s home village of Malin, Co Donegal, on August 18.\n\nSetting out at 7am every day, he hiked for up to 10 hours, managing an average of 27 miles.\n\nAs he completed his trek yesterday, Mr Naismith said: \"The support I\u0027ve had from parents, pupils and staff has been overwhelming.\"\n\nThe route took him from Malin to Londonderry, Aghanloo, Portstewart, Ballycastle, Carnlough, with the final stage down the Shore Road from Whitehead to the college in south Belfast.\n\n\"The toughest stretch was actually along the north coast, from Portstewart to Ballycastle. It is a lovely, gorgeous stretch of the coastline, but it was very busy with traffic,\" he said.\n\n\"It was lovely, though, to see so many tourists enjoying the scenery.

There was so much excitement about coming together for the 150th celebrations and starting the (school) fair.\"\n\nHe had hoped to raise £15,000 for college funds, but already £27,000 has been collected.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland man has whata boutye eyelid tatoo removed year on from benidorm stag","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Dr Donal McKeown, a laser specialist, read Steven\u0027s story online, and offered his expertise in tattoo removal.\n\nA year on, the results have been well worth the wait.\n\n\"In all my 25 years of removing tattoos, I\u0027ve seen them on every other part of the body but never on the upper eyelids,\" said Dr McKeown, who is based on Belfast\u0027s Antrim Road. \n\n\"I\u0027ve even removed them from the inside of the mouth, but Steven\u0027s case was unique, and quite difficult. I had to proceed very cautiously, with the laser down at low levels.\"\n\nSteven, from Tullycarnet, was in Spain as part of a 15-strong group celebrating his cousin James\u0027s upcoming marriage, when he drunkenly decided to get the €22 (£20) \u0027whata boutye\u0027 tattoo.\n\nA year and a half on, he is thrilled to be finally free of his daft eyelid doodles.\n\n\"The laser was worse pain than the tattoos but it was definitely worth it,\" he said. \n\n\"Dr McKeown is brilliant, spot-on. I thought I\u0027d have these things for life, but he knew exactly what to do. My mother and Tommy\u0027s mother weren\u0027t too impressed when they saw them and I took an awful lot of slagging, but thankfully, that\u0027s all died down now. You\u0027d really have to look closely to see any trace of them.\"\n\nSteven and his stag party pals had been in a Benidorm bar all afternoon when Steven decided to add the \u0027whata boutye\u0027 tattoo to his collection, which includes inking on his backside.\n\n\"When we came out of the bar, they all went for a walk down to the beach and I just ducked out and walked until I found the tattoo parlour,\" he recalled. \"I told them what I wanted and that was that.\n\n\"The fella wanted €60 (£54) for it but I only had €22, so that\u0027s what I gave him. It was probably a good job, because a more expensive tattoo would have been harder to remove.\"\n\nSteven had flown to Benidorm from Belfast for a three-night stay and admitted he \u0027lost count\u0027 of how much he had to drink before going under the needle.\n\nSteven is single, but can now use his brown eyes to woo the girls, instead of scaring them off.\n\n\"I think I\u0027ll have a better chance with them now,\" he said. \"And I\u0027ll not be getting inked again in a hurry, I\u0027ll tell you that.\"\n\nOver the last 18 months, he has undergone more than a dozen laser treatments on a bi-monthly basis, with dramatic results. The tattoo on his left eye is 95% gone the other is 97%, according to Dr McKeown.\n\n\"The laser breaks up the ink into very small particles and the body\u0027s own natural defence system removes it from the body,\" he explained. \"Steven has been a very good patient. \n\n\"I was concerned he\u0027d be prone to swelling and bruising at the start, as we were dealing with very delicate skin, but he tolerated the treatments well.\n\n\"Fortunately, Steven\u0027s tattoo was in a blue-black ink, which is easier to remove than other colours. I once had a patient with spider\u0027s web tattoo all over one side of his face - he was lucky it was done in the same sort of blue-black ink that can be broken down.\"\n\nA former west Belfast GP, Dr McKeown has removed hundreds of tattoos, including paramilitary slogans and insignia, over the last two decades.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37247553.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/pope_ireland_010.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts pope visit and local events set to cause disruption","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37245612.ece/b5166/AUTOCROP/w300square/fatberg1.jpg","title":"royal black institution last saturday parades photos","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We are saying that, insofar as it lies within our powers, we will take steps to ensure trade flows freely - what we can\u0027t do is speak for the Government in Ireland about what they would do in the event of a no deal.\"\n\nBrian McGrath, vice president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce and chief executive of Foyle Port, said: \"The engagement gave us the chance to impress upon the Minister the uniqueness of the area and the importance of the City Deal for the region in creating prosperity for the next 20 years. \n\n\"The City Deal offers a positive and sustained opportunity for economic and social development and we look forward to the Minister relaying those messages back to his cabinet colleagues before the next Budget.\"\n\nPSNI Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin met Mr Lidington during his visit to the police headquarters.\n\nHe later tweeted: \"Thanks to Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington for visiting @PoliceServiceNI Headquarters to discuss policing in Northern Ireland and Brexit. Grateful he took the time to visit both our PSNI and RUC Gardens of Remembrance.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"francis arrives in ireland for first papal visit in almost","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The children greeted him in Irish, English and Spanish.\n\nOne of the girls then presented the Pope with a bouquet of flowers. The bouquet included thistles, yellow and white roses and green foliage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Francis is sure to receive a warm reception from the thousands of pilgrims who have travelled to be part of the occasion, he will also be met by protesters angry at how the church dealt with multiple clerical sex abuse scandals that have damaged trust in the religious institution and seriously weakened its influence on Irish society.\n\nMr Coveney acknowledged that many people had mixed feelings about the visit.\n\n“I think it’s been difficult for many people, for victims, for Catholics and many of the clergy,” he said.\n\n“But I hope and expect that this weekend will be a very powerful moment. He has a personality that can reach out to Irish people.”\n\nAt some point over the weekend, the Pope will meet a number of abuse victims in a private meeting amid expectation he will use his public utterances elsewhere to confront the emotive issue.\n\nThe Pope was driven from the airport for a meeting with the Irish President at his residence in Dublin’s Phoenix Park.\n\nFrancis was greeted by Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina at their home at Aras an Uachtarain.\n\nThe Irish greeting party also included Irish government minister for children and youth affairs Katherine Zappone.\n\nAn Irish Army band played the national anthems of Vatican City and Ireland during the arrival ceremony.\n\nMoving inside the property, the pontiff signed the visitors book before entering into a private meeting with Mr Higgins, which took place ahead of a tree planting ceremony.\n\nThe Pope is due to make a speech at Dublin Castle around lunchtime on Saturday, shortly after meeting Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.\n\nEarlier this week, the Pope wrote a 2,000-word letter to Catholics in which he condemned the crime of sexual abuse by priests and subsequent cover-ups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plane carrying Pope Francis arrives at Dublin International Airport (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\n\n\n\nHe demanded accountability in response to fresh revelations in Pennsylvania in the United States of decades of misconduct by clerics.\n\nFrancis is ostensibly in Ireland to attend the World Meeting of Families (WMOF) – a major global church event focused on promoting family values.\n\nHowever, he will also fulfil a number of other engagements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue ribbons are tied to Ha’Penny Bridge, Dublin to remember the victims of clerical sex abuse ahead of the start of the Pope’s visit (Aaron Chown/PA)\n\n\n\n\nWith Ireland in the midst of a high-profile homelessness problem, the Pope will meet a number of impacted individuals and families at a centre run by a religious order.\n\nTens of thousands of people are expected to line the streets of Dublin city centre on Saturday afternoon as he passes through in his famous Popemobile.\n\nIn the evening he will join 82,000 pilgrims at a musical festival in the landmark Croke Park Gaelic Athletic Association stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, the Pope will fly west to Co Mayo, where he will follow in the footsteps of John Paul II and take part in a religious service at a Holy shrine in Knock.\n\nHe will then return to Dublin for the closing centrepiece of the WMOF event – an outdoor Mass in front of an expected congregation of half a million people in Phoenix Park.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures pope francis touches down for visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

Interviews by Gillian Halliday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nFR EUGENE O\u0027HAGAN\n\nCatholic priest and classical singer\n\nThis is an opportunity we may not get for another 40 years. People have high expectations and I think he\u0027s aware of that and he\u0027ll do his best. He\u0027s here to celebrate family and all that means. I hope it will rejuvenate the Church and give encouragement.\n\nI think among many Catholics and non-Catholics there is an admiration for the Holy Father, and his visit will leave a mark on the minds of people, not only people here, but those who are travelling from across the world for the occasion.\n\nI will be performing at the World Meeting of Families concert tonight (as part of singing trio The Priests) and it will be a very special moment for us.\n\nPROFESSOR DEIRDRE HEENAN \n\nUniversity of Ulster academic\n\nI\u0027m going to Dublin Castle to hear the papal address. I was in Drogheda for the first Pope visit with my family and it was an occasion of euphoria and joy, something that I can still remember vividly. Given what has happened to the Church I would say that the hope is that Pope Francis is a very different type of Pope. He\u0027s a very humble man, he has that common touch, and is associated with compassion and social justice. The hope then is that he will acknowledge what has happened but also try and bring some reconciliation and unity to the Church.\n\nPAUL CLARK UTV \n\njournalist and presenter\n\nI was a very junior reporter in 1979 when Pope John Paul II came. I will never forget that occasion, I was working for BBC radio at the time. I was at Drogheda, and honestly, I was slightly disappointed. I had watched the Pope\u0027s visit to Auschwitz, which was very emotional, but I put it down to working rather than being there as an observer. When I watched Pope John\u0027s Sunday morning Mass on television I cried when he said: \"Young people of Ireland, I love you.\" This is a big weekend for Catholics, for the Catholic Church. I\u0027m a man of faith, my background\u0027s Catholic.\n\nThere will be an outpouring of faith, an outpouring of emotion. It\u0027s too early to know what the impact will be for this papal visit. The legacy will be interlinked with what Pope Francis says and what he does.\n\nCOLUM EASTWOOD \n\nSDLP leader\n\nPope Francis\u0027 time as leader of the Catholic Church has been characterised by compassion and an unyielding dedication to challenging poverty, exclusion and injustice a message and mission particularly pertinent in our society today. It is my hope that his visit to Ireland reignites a spirit of reconciliation absent from our politics in recent times.\n\nMost importantly, I hope Pope Francis has the opportunity to meet with and deliver a sincere apology to all those victims whose lives were tormented as result of abuse and its subsequent cover-up by the Church.\n\nOISIN McCONVILLE \n\nGAA personality\n\nI believe that the visit by Pope Francis could help to determine the direction that the Catholic Church in Ireland will take over the course of the next decade at least. I know that for many this will be a very special occasion, and I honestly think that the event could prove a positive step in bolstering the image of the Church.\n\nI think the Pope has taken positive steps of late to address vital issues and his visit, while helping to highlight the fact that the faith is still strong in this country, will also see a spotlight turned on the huge challenges that the Church nonetheless faces.\n\nFR BRIAN D\u0027ARCY \n\nCatholic priest and broadcaster\n\nThe theme of the Pope\u0027s visit is families and I hope that it will give a great deal of encouragement to families. The word \u0027family\u0027 and what it means has changed dramatically and I hope the Church does not impose a definition.\n\nI don\u0027t think people would be quiet if the Pope left without addressing the abuse and victims. I do think people are delighted to see a \u0027real\u0027 Pope, one living in the world. Pope Francis is one of the few leaders in the world people actually listen to.\n\nI hope the visit encourages people to live a better life.\n\nMARGARET RITCHIE \n\nFormer South Down MP\n\nIt\u0027s a very positive development, Pope Francis has proven to be a very humanitarian person. My only regret is that Pope Francis is not coming to the north, to visit our seat of ecclesiastical learning in Downpatrick. Another regret is that I won\u0027t be able to go to Dublin to see him, but I will be watching on television.\n\nAs someone who is a practising Catholic I cherish that opportunity for the people of Ireland to have the Pope visiting in the context of the World Meeting of Families.\n\nI know there\u0027s a lot of issues surrounding it and the Pope must address them, and people must get definitive answers, but the very fact the Holy Father is coming is a very welcome development.\n\nI hope the visit enriches the Church and the people.\n\nDEREK RYAN \n\nCountry singer\n\nI never thought when I recorded the song God\u0027s Plan some years ago that I would get the chance to perform it live for the Pope and an audience of 500,000 people. It will be a memorable yet humbling experience. This will be a hugely important occasion for many as well as being an event that could provide a new focus on the role of the Church in the Ireland of today.\n\nTOM KELLY \n\nMedia commentator\n\nI hope it will be a watershed moment. A papal visit to Ireland is very rare. I was at the parish centre yesterday and people were buzzing there was bunting and flags and talk of arranging how to get down. I\u0027ve been listening to podcasts the last couple of days in Dublin about the build-up to the visit. Ireland is emerging from a dark shadow and I think it will give church-going people a boost. This is a chance for them to celebrate. I\u0027ve put up a papal flag for the first time at my house.\n\nFRANK MITCHELL\n\nU105 and UTV presenter\n\nI was a teenager when Pope John Paul II visited. I was there and one of my memories is that one of the youngsters with us got lost and we spent most of the time looking for him. My interest in this papal visit is great - it\u0027s fabulous to see a world religious leader here who will, and should, have a warm welcome extended.

It’s very dangerous!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwimmers get tossed around at Makapu’u Beach in Waimanalo, Hawaii (AP Photo/Marco Garcia)\n\n\n\n\nHonolulu’s mayor pleaded with tourists that they were putting themselves in danger as the storm moved closer.\n\nThe US National Weather Service downgraded the storm to a tropical storm with winds of up to 70 mph as it headed north toward the islands.\n\nIt was expected to veer west, skirting the islands, but still threatened to bring heavy rains and strong, gusty winds across the state, meteorologist Gavin Shigesato said.\n\nA hurricane watch for Hawaii’s westernmost inhabited islands, Kauai and Niihau, was downgraded to a tropical storm watch. \n\nBut the hurricane centre warned that Lane could trigger flash flooding and inflict wind damage.\n\nThe outer bands of the storm dumped as much as three feet of rain on the mostly rural Big Island in 48 hours. The main town of Hilo, population 43,000, was flooded on Friday with waist-high water as landslides shut down roads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople look over the Wainaku Street bridge as Wailuku River rages below them in Hilo, Hawaii (Hollyn Johnson/Hawaii Tribune-Herald via AP)\n\n\n\n\nElsewhere on the Big Island, the National Guard and firefighters rescued six people and a dog from a flooded home, while five California tourists were rescued from another home.\n\nA different type of evacuation took place on Oahu.\n\nOfficials with Hawaii’s Department of Land and Natural Resources transferred about 2,000 rare Hawaiian snails from a mountain marsh to offices in Honolulu.\n\nSome of the snails are literally the last of their kind.\n\nIn Waikiki, the man-made Ala Wai Canal is likely to flood if predicted rains arrive, said Ray Alexander of the US Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n“The canal has flooded in the past, and I believe it’s safe to say based on the forecast of rainfall it’s likely to flood again, the impacts of which we aren’t prepared to say at this time,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople walk by sandbags stacked up to protect a store near Waikiki Beach (AP Photo/John Locher)\n\n\n\n\nEmployees have filled sandbags to protect oceanfront hotels from surging surf. Stores along Waikiki’s glitzy Kalakaua Avenue stacked sandbags along the bottom of their glass windows to prepare for flash flooding, while residents lined up at stores to stockpile supplies.\n\nAlmost 16,000 homes and businesses on the islands lost power as the outer edges of the storm battered the islands, but service was restored to some.\n\nThe central Pacific gets fewer hurricanes than other regions, with about only four or five named storms a year. The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Iniki in 1992.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"shareholders urged me to keep tesla public says elon musk","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He said it would avoid the short-term pressures of reporting quarterly results.\n\nThe tweet said funding had been secured for the deal, but the company later said the details still had to be worked out with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.\n\nThe tweet said Tesla would offer 420 US dollars per share, 23% above the August 6 closing price. If all the shares were bought, the deal would be worth 72 billion US dollars.\n\n\nAm considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) \nAugust 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\nBut Mr Musk later said he expected only one-third of stakeholders to agree to the buyout. Shares shot up 11% on the day of the tweet, but they have since pulled back, closing at 322.82 US dollars on Friday.\n\nThe bizarre tweet, written while Mr Musk was driving to the airport, brought an inquiry from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which reportedly is looking into whether he was trying to manipulate the share price. Short-sellers, who bet against a company’s success, complained that Mr Musk was trying to hurt them.\n\n\n\nGiven the feedback I\u0027ve received, it\u0027s apparent that most of Tesla\u0027s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company\nElon Musk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the statement, Mr Musk said he worked with investment firms Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Silver Lake to consider all the options, and he talked to investors.\n\n“Given the feedback I’ve received, it’s apparent that most of Tesla’s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company,” he wrote in the statement.\n\nHe said his belief that there was more than enough funding to take the company private “was reinforced during this process”.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, six members of Tesla’s board wrote that the board has dissolved a three-member committee set up to study any possible go-private transaction.\n\n“The board and the entire company remain focused on ensuring Tesla’s operational success, and we fully support Elon as he continues to move the company forward,” the statement said.\n\nThe SEC opened an inquiry shortly after Mr Musk surprised investors with the tweet about going private. The agency has reportedly subpoenaed data from Tesla, indicating that a formal investigation has been opened.\n\nThe privatisation deal would have ended Tesla’s eight-year history as a publicly-held company.\n\nCorporate governance experts say that the contradiction between Mr Musk’s tweet that funding had been secured and a later statement saying that the Saudis still had to do due diligence could be used to show Mr Musk misled investors.\n\nAt least two lawsuits have been filed against Tesla on behalf of shareholders alleging Mr Musk broke the law with his tweet.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"city derry airport celebrate ryanairs new derry edinburgh route free flight giveaway","story":"\nCity of Derry Airport is offering its customers the chance to win one pair of return Ryanair flights to Edinburgh on their social media channels. \n\nThe lucky winner (and their travel partner) will enjoy an enchanting city break where they can explore the rich culture of the Scottish capital.\n\nTour the famous Castle, visit Edinburgh Dungeon, shop ‘til you drop for Christmas on Princes Street or soak up the fun in the cosy restaurants and bars.

You’ve probably seen him in Sandinos, The Guildhall Taphouse, Rodden’s in Buncrana or the Grand Central.\n\nThe whole point of these articles is to highlight the importance of the local music scene and he and his brother Christy are widely regarded as innovators in the dance music fraternity, with tributes from Celtronic and other DJs piled up on Facebook since the terrible news seeped out last Saturday night.\n\nI’m a rocker myself and came quite late to the dance party, but God love him John did his best to educate me. \n\nHe had been for a number of years one of them Derry faces I was familiar with but had no name or conversation to put with it. \n\nOver the years of being his friend I was always amazed by the education he gave me, people I should at least give a chance to listen to and always revere Michael Jackson for he is the source of all that is good in music….at least it wasn’t The Beatles.\n\nWe eventually became friends over a shared love of music, films and a weird sense of humour. \n\nOur conversations always returned to music and would almost certainly contain the words Boards of Canada. \n\nAs a vinyl collector it was John who encouraged me to get into DJing myself so for all those who’ve endured my weird sets, it was his fault entirely.\n\nI spent many a night with him while he was on in Sandino’s and developed an appreciation for music.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027244572\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nI would have otherwise never entertained, I attribute my love of Prince to his sets which goes to show a DJ has done their job right if they’ve turned at least one person on to something. \n\nJust as I’m writing this I wish I had referred to him as Jimmy Rabbitte from The Commitments at least once, he had been playing the Courteeners way before any of us had even heard of them and he was the first to realise they were s***.\n\nNot only did John entertain people with other people’s music but he made his own music, he never let me hear it though. \n\nI’m sure somebody out there has heard it and it won’t be lost. \n\nKnowing John the Greek as I did I’m sure it has his perfectionist stamp all over it.\n\nI could get carried away and paint him as a one-dimensional character and forget his many other loves, including the great outdoors and adventures. \n\nI have been privy to jumping in a car with John without actually asking for a plan and ending in Donegal for the day in absolute sobriety and perfect gratitude for the beautiful scenery and the many things we could do for free right on our own doorstep.\n\nI can’t miss the opportunity to point out two facts here, the first that John was actually a fairly decent barber, which leads to the second fact that once upon a time I used to have hair and he was my personal stylist – although he eventually admitted defeat and suggested accepting baldness and shaving it off!\n\nTributes have come in from all over, the bars and their staff he entertained in will miss him terribly, his ability to know what song to play isn’t that common, nor is the warmth and humour he exuded. His funeral was a testament to the love he showed the world with each of us leaving under no doubt that there is a time to moonwalk.\n\nI’ve waffled on enough and these memories are my own, but they are great memories and I will always look back with a smile. \n\nI’m glad I knew The Greek and I hope that your memories make you smile and hope our love is of comfort to Sophie, his parents and sisters Mia and Angela and their families.\n\n\n\nIf anyone reading this, musician or otherwise feels that they need help get in touch with Help Musicians here https://www.musicmindsmatter.org.uk/ or call 0207 239 9101 or contact Samaritans 028 7126 5511.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"public urged visit arts exhibitions held unusual spaces across derry","story":"\nThree visual arts exhibitions have opened in unexpected places across Derry, including a bar and a park\n\nThey are taking place in the Walled City Brewery, The Gate Lodge and Gywns Café in Brooke Park and The Fashion and Textile Centre.\n\nA further exhibition will take place in the Sion Stables in Sion Mills.\n\nIn the Walled City Brewery, Yarli Allison has created a fake news television broadcast that can be seen on a television in the bar.

The work, which combines original, aerial and archive footage in a multichannel collage is created as a site-specific audiovisual installation for Sion Stables. It reflects on the unique ideology of the village that transects an industrial and pastoral past, and seeks to explore the recreational, secular, and environmental aspects that contribute to the fabric of the village and its people.

If not, then they will fail to absorb and highlight, the true spirit of \u002768.”\n\nMr McKinney questioned why an application for the parade was put forward as early as March and whether Sinn Féin felt major civil rights\u0027 concerns, ‘not least a non-functioning government resulting in adverse social consequences, were irrelevant and had no great immediacy?’\n\nHe pointed to the significance of that date in Derry and the north’s history which is recognised by lowly-paid, unemployed, homeless and the disenfranchised as a ‘a turning point for radical political, social and economic reforms in Northern Ireland.’\n\n“October 5th 1968,” he explained, “is a date linked to an era of hope when pro-democracy citizens banded together to achieve equality for all sections of our population, following the examples of Gandhi and Dr. Martin L. King. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027244566\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“If this historic analysis is distorted by sectarianism it will transpire that there are no limits on what this organisation would do to \u0027legitimize\u0027 themselves.\n\n“The NICRA was a non-party political cross-community organisation which gave the people of Northern Ireland an aspiration that radical change was possible. It created a vehicle whereby all were enabled to participate in a non-violent manner.\n\n“It seems blatantly partisan for one political group, rather than adopting a broad-front approach to contemporary issues, to proceed with a demonstration that suggests an opportunistic attempt to usurp the date and message of NICRA in 1968.\n\n“If that is the case, as many former campaigners and others from a wide range of backgrounds believe, then they should be ashamed of distorting a seminal moment in the history of this place to attract short-sighted populist gain via unpredictable media attention, alongside the inherent dangers, e.g. uncontrollable violent elements.”\n\nIn response Sinn Féin provided a statement from Tyrone MP Francie Molloy who said the party ‘were and remain’ at the forefront of civil rights and social justice campaigns. \n\nHe commented: “Fifty years ago, likeminded people from all communities, including republicans – outraged by the routine injustice and sectarianism of the six county state - came together to form the Civil Rights movement.\n\n“To mark the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march in Derry, Sinn Féin have organised a commemorative march from Duke Street to Guildhall Square, along the original planned route of the march. \n\n“Republicans were to the fore of and remain to the fore of civil rights and social justice campaigns. We would welcome anyone who feels the same to join us.”\n\nSurviving leaders and supporters of the original march were said to have met last November in Belfast City Hall where they decided on a programme of events.\n\nIt is noteworthy, Mr McKinney said, that \u002768 veterans at the initial meeting unanimously voted down a public commemorative demonstration ‘to avoid what may have been interpreted as a coat-trailing exercise’ thereby avoiding any possible violence on the streets. \n\n“It was agreed that such incidents would be highly injurious to the civil rights\u0027 cause, with resultant harmful images of our struggling city and general population, via regional and global media,” he said.\n\nA three-day programme of events will run at the Guildhall from October 4-7 to mark the international Civil Rights Festival, commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Duke Street Civil Rights March, which will see the Irish President Michael D Higgins make a keynote address.\n\nThe event was launched by 50th Anniversary Civil Rights Commemoration Committee last week, and will explore the civil rights\u0027 legacy through documentation, conferences, films and other educational activities.\n\n\nABOVE - Aidan McKinney, far right, pictured with some of the key figures of the Civil Rights Movement with then then President Mary McAleese during her visit to the Guildhall in Derry to mark the 40th anniversary in October 2008.
