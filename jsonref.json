But one Rashford is worth a hundred ministers Marcus Rashford is 22 years old and the reason desperate families will now continue to receive free school meal vouchers during the holidays. During lockdown, this prodigiously talented campaigner has started a charity that has raised millions to feed 400,000 children, partnered on a drive to counter homelessness and now wants to stop 1.3m British children going hungry this summer. Any other CV points – minor interests, hobbies, stuff like that? Ah yes, hang on: he also plays as a forward for Manchester United and England. Today, in a powerful plea that has succeeded in forcing a government U-turn - Rashford wrote: “I don’t claim to have the education of an MP in parliament, but I do have a social education.”And we’ll come to Gavin Williamson, the 43-year-old secretary of state for education, in due course. Suffice to say Gavin has gone so missing in the biggest game of his career that the coastguard has called off the search and it has now become a matter for the Hubble telescope. As for the prime minister … shortly before Marcus Rashford was born to a single mother who he idolises for her tireless work and sacrifices, Boris Johnson was writing that single mothers were producing a generation of “ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate children”. Which, let’s face it, means so much more coming from him.For now, a reminder of where we were two-and-a-half months ago. Taking the podium at a government press conference, even as Covid-19 was ripping silently through the care homes he’d later lie he’d put a “ring of steel” around, Gavin’s cabinet colleague Matt Hancock was very keen to show he had his priorities in order. “I think the first thing that Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution,” Matt proclaimed. “Take a pay cut and play their part.”Well there you go. It must have seemed such an easy win, for politicians who know nothing about footballers, or indeed about football. Or, increasingly, about winning. Just a reminder of where the “world-beating” UK currently is: we have the third highest death toll in the world, the OECD has predicted we will have the worst-hit economy in the developed world, and we are on course for one of the slowest and most socially painful exits from lockdown. If this is world-beating I’d hate to see us lose. I don’t need to tell you that during this entire shitshow, under their exclusive management, the government has only suggested a single group in our society should take a pay cut: Premier League footballers.Why has the government failed children so incredibly badly, in ways that will damage many of them for ever? Did they think people wouldn’t notice? The negligence is so enormous that it demands several interlinked theories. For what minuscule amount it’s worth, I have one for the set. The men – and it is almost exclusively men – who have stood behind Downing Street podiums for months telling us what a great job they’re doing have a somewhat unreal understanding of what has been happening in the domestic sphere since lockdown, because this has never been how they themselves have lived. My suspicion is they have wives who have done huge and disproportionate amounts of home and childrearing work for them, while they have climbed the greasy pole. This has insulated them from the realities of how others live, and consequently from forming anything like an informed appreciation of how they might currently be living under the privations of lockdown. What ends as the failure of a generation of children began simply as a failure of imagination.That would certainly fit with the Sunday that Dominic Cummings spent in No 10 not getting sacked. Then, you might recall, he contrived to persuade Boris Johnson and Michael Gove that driving to Durham was a rational and normal response to maybe having to do some childcare while ill. On the one hand, Johnson’s government would have attempted to keep Cummings if he’d explained he’d driven to Durham in order to carry out a series of ritualistic sex murders. On the other, he had perhaps found two perfect iniduals to sell this particular bridge to. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have the air of guys who would genuinely think driving hundreds of miles in high lockdown was reasonable on the basis of something they would regard as a unique situation. Seriously, what else could Dom do? Certainly not his own childcare, like other human earthling parents.At the end of the day, to fall back on a football commentary staple, it’s guys like this who have failed schoolchildren and vulnerable children. The lives other families have been forced to lead during lockdown haven’t felt in their purview, even when – in the case of Williamson – it is literally their official purview.So we are left with a 22-year-old footballer having to point out the realities to men whose job it is supposed to be to know. The one thing people love to say about footballers is how many nurses’ salaries their contracts could pay for. Oddly, nurses and footballers seem to be the only two currencies traded on this exchange – which must be to the great satisfaction of politicians. And yet, purely in terms of moral worth and strategic competence, how many Gavin Williamsons would you have to amass before you were even close to the value of one Marcus Rashford? How many Matt Hancocks? How many Boris Johnsons? Perhaps it’s time to move the goalposts and ask those questions instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e627bc5fb1fb49e8aa11df51b713ae9b174866d/0_175_5238_3143/master/5238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0809440b4eb85e9de1ef157286158b32","title":"the guardian view on marcus rashfords triumph a political masterclass","story":"By persuading the government to extend the free meal voucher scheme, the Manchester United footballer has taught the prime minister a lesson on solidarityThis Friday, Marcus Rashford will hope to play a starring role for Manchester United, as his team resumes its interrupted Premier League campaign. Even if the 22-year-old striker scores a match-winning hat-trick, it will still not come close to being his best performance of the week.On Monday, Mr Rashford published an open letter to MPs. In it he called for an extension, through the summer holidays, of the voucher scheme that has provided children from poorer families with free meals during lockdown. With cool condescension, Downing Street initially let it be known that, though the footballer had used his fame to “highlight some very important issues”, Boris Johnson would not be taking up his idea. The scheme, it was needlessly pointed out, ordinarily operated only during term time.As Mr Johnson has been forced to learn yet again, these are not ordinary times. By late morning on Tuesday, as Mr Rashford was going through his paces in training, the latest spectacular U-turn had taken place. In a bid to head off a House of Commons rebellion on the issue by Conservative MPs, the prime minister’s spokesman announced a new £120m summer food fund, targeted at families entitled to free school meals.From the failure to spot the iniquity of forcing foreign nurses and carers to pay an NHS surcharge to the self-inflicted damage of the Cummings affair, Mr Johnson has in this crisis repeatedly demonstrated a tin ear on charged and emotional matters. His modus operandi seems to be a strange mixture of cynicism and incompetence.But the deeper meaning of Mr Rashford’s triumph transcends the shabby miscalculations taking place inside No 10. This was a young Mancunian who grew up in one of the poorest districts of his city, standing up for the experience of hundreds of thousands of others like him, across the country. He did so with authenticity, passion and eloquence. Mr Rashford has already donated time and money to the FareShare charity, which has raised £20m to help feed vulnerable children.That was admirable use of the wealth acquired through his talent. But the courageous prosecution of his case with the prime minister – and the refusal to take Mr Johnson’s no for an answer – carries a special significance: Mr Rashford spoke on behalf of, and won a victory for, people who far too seldom command the Tory party’s attention.The message he communicated was simple: the love, kindness and communal concern that sustained his own family – the breakfast clubs and Christmas meals the kindness of neighbours and volunteers – should never be left to chance in a child’s life. That sense of solidarity should, rather, find its highest expression at the very top of politics it should be present in the guarantees that a government makes to all families, however unlucky their circumstances.In the time of Covid-19, this must mean unprecedented ambition to deal with uniquely demanding months ahead. As Mr Rashford suggests, “ordinary” measures are nowhere good enough to assist poorer housholds at a time when mass 1980s-style unemployment looms. It also means recognising and acting upon the legacy of structural inequalities that, as a black, working-class boy, he witnessed at first hand. During the pandemic, millions of children have fallen so far behind that it will now be a challenge to ever properly catch up. Children in families without digital access, and lacking the support networks that were demolished during a decade of austerity, will be the worst off of all. Educational help, as well as food, will be urgently required in the coming period.Mr Rashford has played a blinder. The government must first make good on the commitment he extracted from it. Then it must up its own game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e548cc4a26d64bf3f2d6f9d7e7a592d0db57bc4/130_0_1554_933/master/1554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a860d56f1be32ea68c191944dc1771d","title":"trevor noah rayshard brooks stephen colbert seth meyers","story":"The Daily Show host delivers an emotional monologue on another shooting of an unarmed black man by police – plus a rare bit of supreme court good newsAfter yet another shooting of an unarmed black man by police, Trevor Noah began Monday’s Daily Show with an emotional, searching monologue on the cyclical senselessness of armed police interactions and anti-black racism in America. “Another Monday in the middle of corona and in the middle of protests about police brutality, and yet it’s another Monday of another police brutality incident,” Noah said. “Another story that has people going, ‘How long? How much? When is it enough?’”This weekend, it was Rayshard Brooks, 27, killed in Atlanta after officers were called on him for sleeping in his car in a Wendy’s parking lot. Brooks, clearly intoxicated, was awoken by two Atlanta officers, Garrett Rolfe and Devin Brosnan. They talked for about 30 minutes, all recorded on camera, and “in the beginning, it seems like everything is going to be fine,” Noah said. “The cops are talking to him like a person. They’re not being aggro, they’re not being disrespectful, they’re not being mean or anything. He’s being respectful. He’s calling them ‘sir’, he’s not cussing them out, he’s offering to walk home. Everything is going well.“And then in one moment, in just a few seconds, every part of that normal story turns into the abnormal ending that we’ve come to know as interactions with police and black people.”The officers tried to arrest Brooks, who resisted the officers tried to tase him, and Brooks grabbed the stun gun. As he ran away, Rolfe shot Brooks in the back, killing him.“Why are armed police dealing with a man who’s sleeping in his car?” Noah asked. “These are the questions we need to ask: why, why, why, why, why, why? Why are armed police the first people who have to go and respond to somebody who’s sleeping in their car, who’s drunk?“The sober person, the onus is upon them to make sure the situation doesn’t get out of hand,” he added. “How does it get that far? How does it end with him losing his life?”Noah concluded by presupposing arguments that Brooks would be alive if he hadn’t been drunk, citing the many “ifs” lobbed at the deaths of Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin and Breonna Taylor. “People always say the same thing: ‘If you didn’t do that, you’d still be alive.’ They say this shit all the time – ‘If you didn’t do that.’ But the truth is, the ‘ifs’ keep on changing,” he said.“If you didn’t resist arrest, then you’d still be alive. Or if you didn’t run away from the cops, you’d still be alive. Well, if you didn’t have a toy gun and were 12 years old in the middle of a park, then you would have still been alive. Well, you know what, if you weren’t wearing a hoodie, then you would have still been alive. If you didn’t talk back to the cops, you would have been still been alive. If you weren’t sleeping in your bed as a black woman, you would have still been alive.“There’s one common thread beyond all the ‘ifs’.” he concluded. “If you weren’t black, maybe you’d still be alive.”On the Late Show, a “stunned” Stephen Colbert opened with some actual good news: the supreme court ruled 6-3 that federal anti-discrimination laws protect gay and transgender employees. “Up until this moment, in half of these United States, if your boss found out you were LGBTQ, you could be fired,” Colbert said. “So this is a big gain for human rights, but of course a big loss for Chick-fil-A.”Colbert also touched on the killing of Rayshard Brooks. Brooks’s death “highlights the inadequacy of previous attempts at law enforcement reform”, explained Colbert, because Rolfe had recently completed nine hours of use-of-force training, which focuses on de-escalation tactics. “Well, that didn’t seem to de-escalate the situation too much – maybe he slept through the training,” said Colbert. “Luckily, no one called the cops on him.”“Generally speaking, good news has been hard to come by these days,” said Seth Meyers on Late Night. “So when the Republican-dominated supreme court handed down a landmark decision this morning on whether federal civil rights law prohibits discrimination against LGBTQ people, I was ready for disappointment.” Instead, the court ruled 6-3 to extend federal civil rights protections to all LGBTQ people. “WHAT?! Something good happened?” remarked a shocked Meyers.The “thrilling and momentous ruling” arrives just days after the Trump administration announced it would roll back transgender healthcare protections, “because any time Trump has an opportunity to be an asshole, he takes it”, Meyers said. “I would say the Trump presidency is like a slippery slope toward authoritarianism, but given how bad he is at it, it’s more like a slippery ramp.”Meyers also touched on the various reform measures – banning police chokeholds, for example, or taking down Confederate monuments – in response to mass demonstrations against anti-black racism and police brutality. “Some of these moves are good first steps, others are clearly insufficient,” Meyers said. “But I have to say: in the year 2020, banning chokeholds and taking down monuments to white supremacy should be the absolute bare minimum. We shouldn’t be satisfied with that. That’s like going in for a check-up and your doctor saying, ‘Just so you know … I graduated high school.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ce07a2fe738399bc6e256c1f6a63ca398a10a74/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdee35f5170171752352a7e7f7928776","title":"tell us are you helping uk school children get free meals","story":"We’d like to hear from local initiatives helping to feed disadvantaged children struggling to access free school mealsMarcus Rashford has put pressure on the government to extend its free school meals voucher system for low-income families over the summer holiday period.The footballer’s call – rejected by the prime minister – comes after the scheme in England was extended over the Easter holiday to ensure the 1.3 million children entitled to the free meals did not go hungry during the coronavirus crisis.But the scheme has been beset with problems while many schools remain closed to most pupils, sometimes leaving local initiatives to plug the gaps.Have you helped children get free meals during the lockdown?

Here he talks about how photographing a pair of long-tailed tits nesting in his front garden helped him through a difficult spring“Bum barrels twit on bush and treeScarse bigger then a bumble beeAnd in a white thorn’s leafy restIt builds its curious pudding-nestWi hole beside as if a mouseHad built the little barrel house.”Recently, I was told that I was showing classic signs of “biophilia” – I had to open a dictionary to learn this meant enjoying “the love of life or living systems” and displaying the psychological condition of being attracted to all that is alive and vital. I had just published a picture essay about some tulips that were flourishing in my back garden. I was nervous submitting it – here was a sports photographer, denied his usual fare because of the pandemic, trying his hand at something very different. I was pleasantly surprised by the response, with far more people getting in touch than I’ve ever had for a sports story.\u0026nbspThe tulips died down, but sport was nowhere near a return. I needed something else and, fortunately, nature handed me another gift, a project that would test my photographic skills and give me the adrenaline buzz that I desperately missed from my normal job.Just as lockdown had fully kicked in around my north London home, I couldn’t help but notice two tiny birds flitting around my front garden. I was a complete bird novice. I knew robins, mainly because of Christmas cards, and other birds because they were nicknames of football teams – magpies, eagles, seagulls, canaries, etc. Every year I go with my family to the wildlife photography exhibition at the Natural History Museum and marvel at the pictures, amazed by the skill, technique and patience needed to create such beautiful images. Did it make me want to do similar? Not really, sport was my thing and I was happy with that.But these little birds kept grabbing my attention. We soon realised a nest was being built in the rose bush growing beside our front door. I had no idea what these birds were called, needing an uncle to identify them as long-tailed tits, Britain’s lightest bird and known as bum barrels. “You lucky things!” he said. These two were near-identical cute fluffballs with mainly black and white plumage tinged with bits of grey and pink. Only later, under close inspection of the photos, did I realise one had an orange eyeball, the other had yellow. They went everywhere together I read that long-tailed tits often went round in large groups as an extended family but these two were by themselves. I decided I might as well follow them, seeing if I could get a decent frame or two. This was my chance to be a bird photographer, at least for a while.At first it was really frustrating – I would see them on a branch but before I could focus they were off. They were so quick and seemed nervous of me. As for getting them in mid-air, their undulating and erratic flight seemed impossible to capture. I needed another approach: rather than chasing them around, I realised I had to be in place first and let them come to me. I began to learn their patterns of behaviour, noting routes they flew and places they visited. It reminded me of an approach I use in sports photography, getting to know “the hot zones”, areas where most action happens and the chance of success is greater. With these birds it tended to be near the rose bush, as they would always return there for nest building.To improve my chances of a better picture, I researched the birds expanding my knowledge of them could help me work out what they were doing. As I learned more about the birds I got closer to them. I started to get some half-decent images but all were of them sitting neatly on a branch or bush. I needed something a little more exciting and challenging, to show their character. Luckily for me they decided to provide exactly what I needed.For about three weeks during their nest building they would have sudden mood changes. Most of the time, when perched, they looked calm and cute, but then, out of the blue, they would become aggressive. They began flying into my front windows, repeatedly hitting the glass. I’d never seen anything like this before and no other birds were doing it. I guessed they must have been confused by the reflections off the glass, attacking the mirror image of themselves, thinking it was a rival bird threatening their new nest. I know it might sound a little cruel but I found it fascinating – and not bad for pictures.This behaviour could happen at any time during the day. We could be watching television when there would be a tap, tap, tap on the window – the angry birds. Sitting in my armchair I’d have a perfect view of the TV and the front window. There could be someone having their arm ripped off on the show Tiger King but my gaze was fixed elsewhere.Some days were much quieter. I’d be sitting, poised with camera, waiting for the birds, but nothing. That didn’t seem too bad if I was inside but I would also sit outside, tucked away behind my bins in a basic attempt to disguise myself, getting some very strange looks from passersby, obviously questioning my mental wellbeing. The hours would pass, time enough for me to wonder myself about my own sanity, then suddenly there would be a flurry of action. It reminded me of being at a cricket match, waiting ages for something to happen, then boom, drama all over in a flash.The birds seemed to have their favourite spots. Stretching across the street are a couple of old telephone wires, which they loved sitting on and bouncing in between. It gave them a perfect view down to the nest below and no other bird used them. It was part playground, part lookout, part bathroom and all theirs. Frequently, as the last rays of the setting sun hit the wires, the birds would wash themselves and dry off there.Looking at the nest it was easy to see why the long-tailed tit has been called the structural engineer of the bird world. These two put together an amazing rugby-ball shaped construction with a small entrance hole about three-quarters of the way up. It was built from hair, moss, cobwebs and lichen but, most ingeniously of all, with silk from spider cocoons which made the nest elastic and stretchy, so when it was full of growing chicks it could expand with them. Once the outside was made the two birds set about finding a stash of feathers – up to 2,000 can be used – to line the inside, making it soft for the eggs to be laid.When the nest was done the constant flying ceased. I presumed the eggs were laid as one bird would often stay behind, probably incubating, while the other found food. We loved it when we could see the bird’s head poking out of the nest entrance, watching the world go by. This pattern continued for quite a few days until I sensed something else was happening. I saw one of the birds with food in its mouth heading into the rose bush – a sure sign. Perched on top of a ladder I found a great view, in between branches straight through to the nest entrance which had a large pigeon feather pulled across, shielding the contents inside. The parent completely ignored me and poked its head inside – a tiny beak appeared.From then on, growth for the chicks was rapid, fuelled by the endless food shuttles the parents were doing. Backwards and forwards they flew, laden with various insects and grubs. The chicks quickly lost their reptilian looks, gaining feathers and fluffing up. The distinctive white line of the long-tailed tit was on their heads, like they had tiny Mohican haircuts. It may be a stereotypical scene, seen countless times on television, thrusting beaks of egg-yolk yellow, eager to grab food from a parent, but it still gave me goosebumps witnessing it right there in front of me.The chicks would desperately try to force themselves forward to the very edge of the entrance hole, hoping to be first in line for grub. This jostling of positions would often end up in squabbling and bickering – it struck a familiar chord with me. In between the regular feeds they would sleep, some with necks hanging right out of the nest, not wanting to lose their hard-earned priority position.Unsure of exactly when the first chicks were born, I had to guess the day they might start leaving the nest. Fledging time was approaching. One day I looked out and saw the first chick had ventured from the nest and on to surrounding branches. After about 20 minutes of washing itself and wobbling around, very unsure on its feet, it decided that was enough and headed back inside the nest. The next day I went out very early. Looking down to the ground I saw two chicks had tumbled eight feet from the nest down to the concrete paving.One was already dead, the other looked battered, shaken and groggy – a heartbreaking sight. We scooped up the injured one in a tiny bowl and placed it back in the rose bush. It was ignored by both parents – the question was, did these two chicks fall or were they pushed? Perhaps the nest got overloaded and they were forced out? I also started to think about my role. Should I be trying to save this chick? Was I interfering with nature? It’s obviously a frequent dilemma faced by many recording the natural world. The injured and scorned one fell out of the rose bush another couple of times, and each time we scooped it up and placed it back. After the fourth fall we had to make the decision to leave it to die. I was gutted. Another chick emerged from the nest and briefly wobbled around. Whether or not it saw its sibling lying on the paving below I can’t be sure, but it soon decided freedom was overrated and returned inside.The next morning, while eating breakfast, I heard a commotion from the nest, one much louder than the usual arguments. Going out I couldn’t believe it – the sweetest chicks you could ever imagine emerging from the nest and perched in the branches of the rose bush, seven in total. A mass wash and unfurling of feathers was happening, the chattering noise incredible. Gradually they found their balance and bravery, wandering around before, one by one, they summoned up the courage to take their maiden flights, in this case around three feet over to the privet hedge. Some just about made it some fell short, landing on a dustbin, window box or dwarf Christmas tree. One landed on my camera. Somehow they all managed to meet up in the privet hedge, where they began to mimic being back in the nest, squeezing together in a bundle of fluff and feather.That first night out they went to sleep, seven in a row, packed tightly on a branch in the privet hedge. But the next morning, they had gone. I looked for ominous signs, like loose feathers, fearful that a cat or fox had found them. Thankfully there were none.They had flown off and my feeling of responsibility had gone with them. I stood in my back garden, all around me a cacophony of tweets and squeaks as new wings were being tested out, but not the ones I was really interested in. Occasionally I spotted one of the parent birds in among all the others, blackbirds, thrushes, wrens and wood pigeons … and robins of course. Later that evening I saw one of our chicks in a tree near our bathroom window, looking tiny, out by itself in the wide, open world. But after that sighting I saw them no more. They were definitely gone.It has been said that sport has often played a vital role at times of crisis, battles on the pitch taking the nation’s mind away from battles off it. This time, it’s clear to me that nature has stepped up to take on the role of the great distractor. Thanks to this wonderful family of tiny birds, the natural world handed me solace and respite, helping me keep my sanity during this crazy spring. Thank you my beautiful bum barrels, I’ll never forget you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b47929c4e58a35fa8151684dcbb58e8d59477fb/0_138_4144_2487/master/4144.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=758150bd3132303cf3ea68c6893d47d6","title":"my favourite film aged 12 cruel intentions","story":"This stylish 1999 take on the aristocratic sexual scheming of Les Liaisons Dangereuses remains just as seductive as when I first saw itI don’t know what it says about me that my favourite film aged 12 is my favourite film aged 30. It could mean that I am enduringly loyal, knew my mind at a young age, and had mature tastes. Or it could be that I haven’t developed at all as an inidual and am stubborn as a wine stain.My favourite film is Cruel Intentions. Nowadays it sits in my affections alongside more serious and arty fair, as well as classics: Three Colours Blue, Some Like It Hot, Persona, The Silence of the Lambs etc. Back then, in the late 90s, its competitors were The Craft (1996), Anaconda (1997), Scream (1996),Clueless (1995). All of these I was introduced to via Blockbuster VHS rental.For those of you unfamiliar, Cruel Intentions is a 1999-modern take on Stephen Frears’ Dangerous Liaisons (1988), itself an adaptation of Christopher Hampton’s 1985 play, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, itself an adaptation of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’ 1782 epistolary novel. The novel tells the tale of the sexual scheming of the aristocratic Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, narcissistic ex-lovers who get their kicks – and their rocks off – by manipulatively seducing paramours unsuspecting of their status as mere pawns in Merteuil’s and Valmont’s cruel, competitive game of conquests.Valmont, however, is redeemed by his eventual love for Madame de Tourvel, originally the subject of a bet with Merteuil. All this is set against the decadence of the ancien régime, in the decade leading up to the 1789 French Revolution. Though I imagine you had already grasped this was in France.Of course, I wasn’t aware of all this aged 12, though pretentiously and precociously I did read Laclos’ book aged about 15. In Cruel Intentions, the re-imagined “Kathyrn” Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and “Sebastian” Valmont (Ryan Phillippe) are private-high-school step-siblings, enjoying their summer holidays in their Upper East Side pad, their rich and negligent parents nowhere to be seen. Their main hobby aside from shopping, horse-riding and driving around in vintage cars? Shagging, of course. Meanwhile, the Tourvel character becomes the new girl at school, “Annette” (Reese Witherspoon). As with the book, there is an additional subplot a true cat’s cradle of heartstrings.What did I love about Cruel Intentions then, and what do I love about it now? Some things sit in the centre of the Venn diagram, others are split with time. Sebastian’s initial cruelty is countered with incredible charm, the cheek of his smile and confident, caustic wit. As a young pretender, I was insatiably drawn to his pithy one-liners, brilliantly scripted by Roger Kumble, who also directed – and whose entire career has been defined by this film.I thought (and perhaps still think) there is no more suave answer to the question, “What are you doing tomorrow?” than “I’m going out with you.” There is the scene where Sebastian remotely blares classical music into Annette’s room – and only her room – when they are staying in the same house. Then switches the music to the Cardigans’ Lovefool when she comes to remonstrate with him. The way he teases her when asking her to join him for a swim, and she, also capable of smarts, replies: “I suppose your proposal was only mildly insulting, so I’ll consider it.”Did I mirror Sebastian’s positive characteristics (even if he often employed them insincerely)? Did I start louchely standing with my hands in my pockets the exact way he did and begin to keep a leather-bound journal? Was I hornily rewatching the film to satisfy my burgeoning, or, more accurately, burgeoned, interest in all things sexual? Yes to all. Aged 12, I simultaneously wanted to be Sebastian and to be with Phillippe. I was not happy that he ended up marrying Witherspoon in real life.In a many ways, the film was progressive. It included a lingering woman-on-woman snog (which won the MTV movie award for best kiss) – and this only two years after Ellen DeGeneres came out, with her show cancelled after a backlash. Sebastian’s best friend (played by yet another 90s staple, Joshua Jackson) was gay, without comment. I was keen, too, on the unabashedly feminist (though I wouldn’t have used the f-word then) attitude of Kathyrn: “God forbid, I exude confidence and enjoy sex” railing against the confines of womanhood and gender double standards. (“Do you think I relish the fact I have to act like Mary Sunshine 247 so I can be considered a lady?”) Racism was addressed, too: a character played by Sean Patrick Thomas being told he’d been helped “off the streets”. “Off the streets? I live at 59th and Park.”The soundtrack: still one of the best. Mostly a mix of mainstream, cool (Blur, Fatboy Slim, Placebo etc) and bands I had never heard of before, and have never heard of since. Listening to Bitter Sweet Symphony by the Verve, which plays during the end scene, still makes me cry and swoon moodily as it did then. And that end scene retains all of its stirring, triumphant power.I also was not (and am not) immune to the film’s aesthetic luxuries: the sweeping shots of the New York skyline the wide angles of a country house in the Hamptons, the costume design of Kathryn’s flattering couture dresses and Sebastian’s old-school tennis whites.There has been some present-day criticism that Sebastian more or less tricks one of his conquests into oral sex (“He took down my pants and he started writing the alphabet but he was writing it with his tongue”). But this is the exact kind of behaviour implicit to his character, long before the transitional moment when Annette says to him, “I’m impressed”, and he replies, “Well, I’m in love”, which somehow manages to make riding an escalator romantic.The only thing that could ever taint the film would be watching the roundly panned sequels and prequels with none of the original cast members, which is why I pretend they do not exist. A cancelled television series a second and third film, both straight-to-video. I ignore these because though Laclos’ cautionary tale of morality is timeless that, to this day, it teaches us things about the complexity and contradictions of people, I do not want Kumble’s translation diluted.The brilliant screenplay, which gave the story a sassier, more optimistic ending than the book. The genius of the new setting. The perfect casting (Phillippe – much more charismatic than the reptilian John Malkovich in Dangerous Liaisons Alan Rickman, Colin Firth and Dominic West have all had a bash on stage or screen, too) Gellar, famously blond in her mainstream television role as Buffy Summers, going unrecognisably brunette Witherspoon showing her range by playing the opposite of Tracy Flick in Election support from Selma Blair and others Christine Baranski!). Fortunately, a television reboot mooted in 2016 only made it as far as an unaired pilot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad0c8d9ddcff3bcc72509b7fbd1249f04f3528d8/0_62_2554_1532/master/2554.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=dfb76364589bc52a6ac27b49ca7c06b6","title":"bayern munich win eighth successive bundesliga title with win over bremen","story":"Bayern Munich have been crowned Bundesliga champions for an eighth successive season after a 1-0 win at Werder Bremen.Bayern’s domination of German football continues as an 11th successive win means Borussia Dortmund can no longer catch them.It was fitting that Robert Lewandowski’s goal earned the title, with the Poland striker’s 31st league strike of the season enough to see off struggling Bremen – even a red card for Alphonso Davies late on could not sour the evening.The manner of Bayern’s 29th champonship, with a three-month suspension, will live long in the memory thanks to the scintillating style of play introduced by Hansi Flick, who took over from Niko Kovac in November.They have been particularly fearsome since the restart last month and on this form will be strong contenders to win the Champions League later this summer.Borussia Mönchengladbach strengthened their Champions League hopes with a 3-0 win against Wolfsburg.Jonas Hofman’s two first-half goals put them in command before Lars Stindl made it a comfortable evening.Elsewhere, Union Berlin beat bottom club Paderborn 1-0 to secure their survival and Europa League hopefuls Freiburg were 2-1 winners over Hertha Berlin.In Spain Barcelona extended their lead over Real Madrid at the top of La Liga to five points with a 2-0 win at home to Leganés.

Fire up the celebration-cam. Unleash the crowd noise algorithm. Daub those exposed extremities with rubbing alcohol. The return of the Premier League on Wednesday night may technically be a resumption, conclusion to a season that began 10 months and one global health trauma in the past. In reality it feels like something self-contained and entirely other.Welcome to football as a high-speed entertainment product, sealed within its bubble, zooming off towards the vanishing point. Welcome to 92 live games in six summer weeks, to deserted stands, video walls and the strangling of the post-match quotes industry. Welcome to the new abnormal normal.And yet for all the disquiet in getting to the start line, it is impossible not to feel fascinated by the prospect. There will be glimpses in the weeks to come of how this overblown but oddly indestructible sport might look in the near future. Who knows, it might just all turn out to be quietly uplifting.It is significant how quickly this has changed. Before the past two weeks, the prospect of the Premier League returning still felt odd and rather brutal.It seemed absurd to many people that something as trivial as a game of football should be a first step in testing the limits of normal society – like sending a mariachi band first out of the nuclear bunker to report on radiation levels and the presence of zombies.But here we are, restarting under conditions that make the rest of society look a little reckless by comparison. In the Premier League’s version of reality, players will stick to a “sterile route” on matchdays. Red-zone passports with up-to-date testing will be required to enter the shared areas. In the media zone only those submitting to temperature tests, a health quiz and compulsory face coverings will be admitted.Meanwhile, regular British citizens are flying in planes, disgorging into retail parks, engaging in mass hand-to-hand combat with strangers and queueing back to the mini-roundabout for sugary cheeseburgers. In this context the idea there is something inappropriate about the profitable parts of football resuming has, frankly, gone out of the window. This is an industry that generates pay cheques and fond escapism. Both of these are quite welcome right now.At which point it is probably time to talk about the football. What will we get over the next six weeks? A common first response to the rejigged summer format was a fear the Premier League would be serving up seriously weak gruel: interrupted, disassembled teams seeing out the fag end of a bitty, transitional season for many clubs. This may have been true in March. There will still be no title race: Liverpool, champions of Europe, have been astonishingly good, while everyone else has been so-so. But for the rest of the ision this is a do-over, football in space, without gravity or the sound of explosions, sealed within its airlock.The points-split of the top five teams means the race for the Champions League could still fizzle out in the space of three fixtures. But should Manchester City’s European ban be upheld by the court of arbitration of sport – and right now it is in effect – the last 10 games will have eight clubs within six points of fifth place and Champions League qualification.This comes at a time when, frankly, anyone can beat anyone, when form has disappeared and when some players and teams will undoubtedly benefit from a complete 90-day break, for many the first since the start of their professional careers.The idea of Crystal Palace surging up the table to edge out Manchester United from the Champions League may seem a fanciful outcome. At which point, sceptical reader, I refer you to the year 2020: outline plot so far.As for City themselves, the return of Aymeric Laporte will strengthen every part of the team, from defence to midfield to basic passing patterns. Leicester should be fine. A lean first-team squad has had time to rest. The same probably goes for Chelsea, also patchy since the turn of the year.Against this, Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham may all expect to finish strongly. It is easy to forget that José Mourinho was appointed Spurs manager in November, just as the first Covid-19 cases were being reported in Wuhan province (the two are not connected). Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Moussa Sissoko are fit.The Mourinho style, whatever that may actually be these days, has had an extended pre-season to bed in. Arsenal have had the chance to enact a similar process with Mikel Arteta. Neither have much to lose, but 10 games to win. Downtime has invigorated seasons that were drifting.Manchester United are also at a fascinating stage, unbeaten since January and with Paul Pogba, Scott McTominay and Bruno Fernandes a potentially mouthwatering midfield. Below them Wolves and Sheffield United are both in with a shot of European football.Stretch down to the bottom third and there is a potentially fraught relegation fight between five clubs separated by four points. From a standing start pretty much anything could happen down there .Beyond this there is the suspicion that the summer festival might lead somewhere else, one step nearer perhaps to some kind of super league or club world cup. Certainly some of those old certainties will seem a little less carved in rock.As a sign that nothing is off the table, the Premier League has even grown a political conscience, attaching itself tenaciously to the Black Lives Matter movement, albeit on grounds this is a human rights not a political issue. In reality, player pressure has brought this about and all credit to those responsible. As for politics, well, this is clearly hogwash: racial inequality is one of the dominant political issues of the age. Quite how close a Premier League built on unregulated capitalism and money from all-comers wants to stand to that fire remains to be seen.For now we have something else, something clear and oddly distinct, a league that has been revealed by those 90 days in the wilderness to be all business, to be heavily in hock to its own spending and also, by the end, to be reassuringly indispensable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e76b5dbc0d56c37e03598c82a14b0d2b21bba088/0_34_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f67691ea5c884789b9cca83f3bca48e0","title":"marcus rashfords campaign victory football power to effect change","story":"Ignore the cynical grumblings and, as this inspiring 22-year-old says, concentrate on what can be done when we work togetherSome PR stunt. In securing free school meals for deprived children in England over the summer holidays, Marcus Rashford has generated more tangible good with his voice than he ever will with his feet. In forcing the prime minister into a hasty spin of the heels, Rashford has delivered a timely reminder that football’s influence and cultural currency stretch well beyond its own borders. And by reaching beyond those borders in an urgent and worthwhile cause, he has demonstrated the power of common resolve and common purpose, at a time when – as he himself put it – society “appears to be more ided than ever”.This, perhaps, is the wider point here, one that goes well beyond child malnutrition or child poverty or narrowing opportunity – or even the decade of callous political choices that have led to all three. Just 22 years of age and with little to no experience in professional politics, Rashford not only identified an achievable policy aim but solicited advice, did his own research, took soundings. Most importantly of all, he then sought the one prerequisite to any sort of change worth getting out of bed for. “Just look at what we can do when we come together, THIS is England in 2020,” Rashford tweeted upon the news that his campaign had borne fruit.Indeed, if there has been one overarching theme of Rashford’s activism and his methods, it has been the pursuit of consensus. “This is not about politics,” he wrote early yesterday. “The same way us players put rivalry aside when we put the England shirt on, please #maketheuturn.”In one important sense this is about politics. Children don’t go hungry in a vacuum. Only one party has been in office for the past decade. But perhaps Rashford’s point here is about the pitfalls of partisanship, the boundaries of tribal loyalty, the limits of shouting in a closed room. Keir Starmer doesn’t control the education budget. LBC’s James O’Brien can’t change government policy. And as the Premier League starts up its engines and once again requests our unided attention, there is a lesson here for all of us who profess an interest in the game.It has become fashionable to see the world in terms of archetypes. Sport, and football in particular, encourages this trait by offering up ready-made silos, natural enmities, eternal conflict. Think of a team you don’t like and then try to think of all the different terms you use to disparage them. But this goes beyond club loyalty and into iniduals: endless tribes, endless othering. You do it, I do it, we all do it. The plastics. The null-and-voiders. The football hipsters. As if every aspect of one’s personality, one’s essence, one’s basic humanity, could simply be extrapolated from a single opinion or choice.Just this once, it’s fine to ignore the noise. There will always be a cynical constituency to whom any public act by a public figure must be imputed with malign motives. Brazil’s fourth goal against Italy in 1970: a PR stunt. Paolo Di Canio catching the ball just as he was about to score: a PR stunt. The 1914 Christmas truce in no-man’s-land? How convenient photographers turned up just as they were starting the game.Rashford’s reputation will take a boost as a result of this – but, ultimately, who cares? Certainly not the families poised to benefit from his intervention. And what makes Rashford’s pursuit of this cause so compelling is that it so clearly derives from his own experiences, his own senses, his own world. He knows what it feels like to be hungry. To be reliant on the generosity of others for survival. To take the bus from Manchester to Salford for training at The Cliff and be struck by the number of homeless people on the streets.The “us and them” instinct in elite English football has arguably never been stronger. As a sport, we seem to have mislaid the idea that clubs are umbilically linked to their localities, that footballers are tied to the communities that produce them, that football fans have a shared consciousness that should occasionally cut across tribal boundaries, that the superclubs and the smaller clubs and the Sunday League clubs are part of a single, breathing organism, that collective problems can only be met with a collective solution.And at times like this – atomically sealed, physically distanced, our contact with each other mediated through Zoom windows and email tabs – it becomes harder to think of ourselves as a cogent whole, as one game with a common purpose. This, perhaps, is the true sporting legacy of Rashford’s activism: to remind us that when football speaks with one voice, nobody dares shout it down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/256716d8326f3ec25d081ea906b1585a13b4f4a8/302_0_4740_2844/master/4740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbbbb1786efd22853ea4e001a29fbc7b","title":"alina ibragimova kristian bezuidenhout wigmore hall radio 3 review","story":"Wigmore HallBBC Radio 3Perfectly paired, violinist Alina Ibragimova and pianist Kristian Bezuidenhout’s recital was a masterclass in how familiar repertoire can be lifted from the page and fashioned anewIt may be a heretical view – especially in Ludwig van’s 250th anniversary year – but allow me to confess: the thought of a violin recital programme pairing Beethoven with Schubert had not set my pulse racing. (No, not even under lockdown, starved of live music as we all are.) Surely there are more varied, more imaginative ways to perform for an hour? But apparently not – at least in the case of Alina Ibragimova’s Wigmore Hall recital with pianist Kristian Bezuidenhout.It’s difficult to imagine a more complementary match. Ibragimova rejoiced in muscular attack, her gloriously polished tone frontloaded with energy, while Bezuidenhout was more laid-back, his touch delicate, his unerring sense of musical line delivered absolutely fuss-free. Schubert’s Sonatina in A minor, D385 showcased their combined capacity to make new musical sense of conventional gestures – and to find contrast within apparent sameness. Thus the subtle transitions from hyper-Romantic juxtapositions of biting articulation and barely perceptible pianissimos via a twinkle-in-the-eye minuet to a finale in which Bezuidenhout’s left hand was so finely delineated (imagine the walking bass of a jazz standard) that at one point he bopped along on the piano stool.Beethoven’s Violin Sonata No 5 in F major, “Spring”, Op 24 revealed a whole new set of colours. Ibragimova’s articulation was at times highly textured, elsewhere spun out into legato stretching far into the distance. Bezuidenhout’s playing was always limpid – indeed the entire first movement was impossibly gracious – but he was also the fleet-fingered ringleader of the scherzo’s rhythmic games. Full of light and life, this was music-making held in almost miraculous balance: a reminder of how even the most familiar repertoire can be lifted from the page and fashioned anew.• Available to listen on BBC Sounds and watch via Wigmore Hall Live Stream.

Now at 80, Dion is embracing the blues – and his status as one of the last rock’n’rollers standingDion DiMucci was 13, maybe 14, when he first sang in a club for money, roughly the same time as he picked up a heroin habit that lasted 15 years. He got on the stage and belted out three Hank Williams songs –\u0026nbspCold, Cold Heart, Jambalaya and Hey Good Lookin’\u0026nbspand when he was done “the owners, Yodi and Bart, they gave me $20 apiece, which was more than my parents’ rent that they argued about every day. It was a whole month’s rent and I just sang a couple of songs.”Yes, says Dion (no one ever uses his surname – he’s been Dion since he became a doo-wop star in the 1950s, and that’s not changing now),\u0026nbspthe money made music attractive, but it was the chance to say something that made him stick with it, although his career has had highs and lows. Even some of the high points have been lows: Born to Be With You – his dazed, brilliant 1975 album with Phil Spector, which cast teen pop as a spiritual experience – was not released in the US at the time, and was ignored elsewhere, only gaining its reputation two decades later. The dazzling Kickin’ Child, recorded in 1965 and offering a version of “that thin, wild, mercury sound” at exactly the same time as Bob Dylan was inventing it, was shelved by Columbia, only getting released in 2017.But Dion has never stopped. As well as the doo-wop, he’s sung rock’n’roll, folk rock, Christian music, MOR music and everything in between. And for the past 15 years, he’s been a bluesman, singing in a voice that has barely weathered. Now 80, he’s releasing Blues With Friends, in which an array of superstars (Bruce Springsteen, Billy Gibbons, Joe Bonamassa, Paul Simon, Van Morrison and more, with sleevenotes by Bob Dylan)\u0026nbsphelp him out on 14 originals, including a revival of Kickin’ Child. The presence of Morrison, he says, was the first thing to really impress his wife, Susan, in 57 years of marriage. “I am so in with my wife because I sang with Van Morrison. She’s got 12 Van Morrison CDs in her car. So now I’m in!”It’s startling that his voice seems almost unaffected by the years, although he can hear differences. “I was talking to Paul Simon yesterday. I was telling him, ‘Paul, I’ve been listening to this record, and I can still sing great. I sing my original songs, in the same key, but I lost that 17-year-old innocence. But you still have that sweetness, that beauty, that powerful purity. I don’t know how you did it.’ And he said basically the same thing I would say. ‘I do well and I take care of myself, but I haven’t focussed on keeping my voice.’ We both don’t smoke or drink. That can make your voice husky.”Blues With Friends doesn’t sound a bit like his rock’n’roll hits, nor Born to Be With You, nor his folk-rock era. It continues in the direction he began in 2006 on his Grammy-nominated album Bronx in Blue, playing the music that was once the spring from which rock’n’roll began, which saw one writer describe him as a “Catholic blues singer”. That makes Dion laugh. “To be honest with you, if you had to retitle the psalms, the songs King David wrote in the Bible, you’d call them the blues. It’s like the naked cry of the human heart longing to be in union with God. Those guys are crying out in pain. They feel isolated, they feel separated, they just don’t feel good. And they got the blues. Everybody in the Bible got the blues, probably including God, from the travails of overseeing us. God is love, he’s not loving, he is love.”It’s all basically the same music to Dion, though. “To me, it’s all a slight adjustment. If I sing songs from any decade on my guitar, it all sounds the same. It all sounds like Dion music. People think I change from this to that, but I don’t know how much I change. They put a label on it, you know? But it all comes from inside me.”Dion and the Belmonts – four Italian-American kids who grew up around Belmont Avenue in the Bronx’s Little Italy – were like any of the groups of street-corner toughs who sang sweetly to the girls during Dwight D Eisenhower’s second term as president. Music was how they would all say the things they couldn’t put into conversation, for fear of being kicked around the block.“I had this song, one of my first records, called No One Knows. I sat on the stoop of the tenement building, and the gang was there. Then we’d go to cellar parties, and I would sing this song that goes, ‘No one knows what I go through  And the tears I cried for you  And when I smile it’s just a pose  My heart is breaking, but no one knows.’ But a lot of that stuff, you couldn’t say. That’s why people go to the bar and put money in the jukebox and put on Only the Lonely, because they can’t tell you they’re lonely. They can just play the song 20 times.“I realised early on you could bypass somebody’s brain. You don’t threaten anybody by singing, but if you were in a bar and turned to your friend and said, ‘You know, I’m lonely’, you’d get a punch right in the head. It just don’t ring right, you know? But you could relate to a record and identify with the song, and no one feels threatened, and no fights break out. It was kind of like a secret. I could sing about what people were thinking without them feeling threatened.”But Dion had something else. Listen to some of those early hits – The Wanderer or Runaround Sue – and you hear a personality, someone crackling with life, amused, lustful and with a hint of threat. He sounds like a tough guy who wants to be liked, but who can’t bring himself to entirely conceal his switchblade. The Dion of the late 1950s and early 60s was such an archetype of Italian-American masculinity that Martin Scorsese probably has a shrine to him somewhere.The heroin, he says, was nothing too unusual around Belmont Avenue, even 60 years ago. “With the guys I was hanging out with, it was the normal thing. There were some that never got involved. I don’t know if I had a propensity for it, or a disposition. But I knew the first time I took it, man, I loved it, so off I went. I was using drugs for about 15 years, from 14 to about 28. In 1968 my friend Frankie Lymon died of an overdose and I got on my knees, said a prayer, and I haven’t been the same since. I haven’t had a drug or a drink for 52 years.”After splitting from the Belmonts, he became the first rock’n’roller signed to Columbia – “They were paying me 100 grand a year whether I made a record or not” – and began a solo career. It’s possible some of Dion’s memories of that era have been burnished by the years – he says he and the producer Tom Wilson were the ones who first had the idea of putting an electric band behind Dylan –\u0026nbspor by the fact he was then at the height of his heroin addiction. Either way, he quit Columbia when they refused to release Kickin’ Child. “I have no idea why they did it. I’m thinking, ‘What the hell do you want?’ So I just left. I couldn’t care less. I called it integrity my wife called it insanity.”It was only a few years ago, hearing the album for the first time since he was an addict, that he was able to separate Kickin’ Child from the time of its creation. “When I heard it clean and sober I thought, ‘Wow. Whatever I was doing, heroin didn’t touch it.’ The art bypassed the drug.”When Little Richard died in May, Dion was among the first to pay tribute. Recalling all those heroes of 1955 and 1956, he says: “Then I heard Little Richard. That’s got to change your life.” Now, he and Jerry Lee Lewis are the only major figures of the great teenage explosion left standing – and Dion wouldn’t be, had he not refused to pay the $36 it would have cost to board the flight that killed Buddy Holly. Still, he says, he’s not dwelling on mortality. He feels like he did when he was a teenager.“When I was a kid and I got up in front of a high-school dance with my band and I sang a song, I was taking people on a trip. And I don’t think I’ve changed. I’m still the same. I still like that feeling.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

They have aired everything from Saturday night dancehall party sets to Ghanaian hiplife, 70s Afro-jazz and reggae, and brought their station to listeners in 99 countries.“We’ve used the tools we could as well as we could,” says Anthony, also known as RBC, one of the station’s producers. “The internet took a radio stream with our bredrin’s to the other side of the world. We’re doing it from our bedrooms and houses with mum’s wifi, and now we’re being played in places like Mauritius.”“Our culture is rich across the board,” adds Joseph, “Everything you see here is us, is black people. Whether you’re from this place or that place, we’re all represented by the shows on this channel. We wanted people to feel like they have a home here.”#NS10v10 has been key to their success. The interactive music session is part soundclash – with roots in Jamaican soundsystem culture, where rival systems go back-and-forth with songs for crowd-crowned supremacy –\u0026nbspand part gameshow, with inspiration drawn from lockdown Instagram broadcasts such as Canadian rapper Tory Lanez’s Quarantine Radio.\u0026nbspThe rules are simple: two rival contestants represent a predetermined artist, then battle over 10 rounds, facing song choices off against one another. The winner is decided by Twitter users, who declare the strongest track in each round. “I love watching football and Love Island, and the online commentary always adds another layer of enjoyment,” says Jojo. “I thought: how can we do that, but with live audio?”The show’s first season included tracks from rappers Skepta and Giggs being pitched in a UK all-star clash, an Afro-swing standoff with J Hus and Kojo Funds, a 90s rap show between Missy Elliot and Busta Rhymes, and an R\u0026ampB throwdown with Mariah Carey and Beyoncé. A special 80s v 90s edition between special guest hosts Ian Wright and Julie Adenuga saw the former England footballer use the platform to open up on the tolls of online racism.With every clash that passed, the show spread through social media, the #NS10v10 hashtag becoming an interactive dancefloor, spilling out from “black Twitter” and into new corners of the internet. The clash between Wizkid and Vybz Kartel was the tipping point. Over 200,000 listeners tuned in that evening, and since then, No Signal’s audience has continued to grow exponentially.But No Signal is more than a soundclash-slash-gameshow. With the close of the first season, the station expanded its programming. A string of new interactive shows include Ask Oloni, an agony aunt show with sex blogger Dami “Oloni” Oloniskin, and Spot the Sample with writer Jesse Bernard, which explores the samples tying together some of hip-hop’s most iconic eras and songs.\u0026nbspElsewhere, intermissions spotlight worthy causes for listeners to rally around: community platforms such as the BYP Network connect black professionals with job opportunities and The Black Curriculum is an organisation teaching school students black British history.\u0026nbsp“It’s the right thing to do – we’re a resource for people,” says Jojo. “Social media drowns out a lot and it’s hard to pay attention to certain things. But it’s beneficial for everyone to know about these great causes that need to be put out there.”\u0026nbspBy threading these wider elements into the station, No Signal display the variety in the black British experience, hosting the niche conversations and community-wide issues that, in this country, weave black identities together like willow baskets.\u0026nbspWith lockdown edging to a close, thoughts have turned to No Signal in the new world we will eventually inherit. They have already partnered with Spotify, with each #NS10v10 clash available for playback on the streaming platform, and there are plans to further establish themselves as a fully-fledged radio station, picking up the specialist black radio mantle left behind when London-based station Choice FM was absorbed into Capital.“There’s been a gap in the market for black culture,” says Neil, also known as AAA, who programmes and produces on the station, as well as hosting a show. “There are radio stations that covered grime and alternative music, but the black community had Choice FM and we proper miss that.”Until then, they continue with a scheduled programming bonding together the many faces of black music, and reviving the spirit of black club nights shuttered by quarantine. Amid isolation, they have become more than radio: a gathering for those seeking out community in lonely times.\u0026nbspThe second season of #NS10v10, meanwhile, is under way, and Twitter timelines are once again turning into dancefloors. In the Boy Bands v Girl Bands clash, full of 90s throwbacks and house party gems, selector Nicksy is taunting her rival. “These are connoisseurs, these are uncles, these are OGs in the game!” she laughs as Premier Gaou by Ivorian group Magic System fades in: “African hall party classic!”• This article was amended on Tuesday 16 June to correct the real names of the DJs AAA and RBC."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e224368694f02db1d63ef736934da6690cbd92/0_18_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01f5ed3327e1d5fc7d19f157fa1bbecf","title":"how the disappearance of madeleine mccann became a national obsession podcast","story":"The disappearance of a three -year-old British girl at a Portuguese holiday resort in 2007 quickly became a global news story as the hunt for her grew ever more extensive.

We give 10 times as much aid to Tanzania as we do to the six countries of the western Balkans, who are acutely vulnerable to Russian meddling.”Oxfam GB’s chief executive, Danny Sriskandarajah, called that comparison a “brazen challenge to the aid sector”. pointing out that more than half of Zambians live on less than $1.90 a day, while extreme poverty in Ukraine is near zero.“Effectively what he’s saying is, we’re going to use our aid budget to pursue security and diplomatic aims. Those are noble aims, but that’s not what aid is for,” he said.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, responding to Johnson’s statement, described the move as “the tactics of pure distraction” from the country’s soaring unemployment and one of the highest Covid-19 death rates in the world.“Abolishing DfID diminishes Britain’s place in the world,” he said. “There is no rationale for making this statement today. The prime minister should stop these distractions, and get on with the job of tackling the health and economic crisis we currently face.”Gordon Brown, who championed debt relief and increased aid spending as prime minister, described the decision as sad, while Tony Blair said he was “utterly dismayed”.DfID’s £15.2bn budget dwarfs that of the Foreign Office, and diplomats have jealously eyed the scale of the guaranteed DfID spending ever since the two departments were split by the Labour government in 1997.The new department is expected to be formed in the autumn, before the government has completed its integrated foreign and defence security review, which is being carried out by the academic and Downing Street adviser John Bew.DfID was already braced for a sharp cut in its budget with the economy hit hard by the coronavirus crisis.It is unclear if Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international development secretary, will retain a cabinet post after the autumn.Patrick Watt, Christian Aid’s director of policy, public affairs and campaigns, called the decision “an act of political vandalism”, saying it “threatens a double whammy to people in poverty, and to our standing in the world”.The timing of the merger, long favoured by Johnson and his key aide, Dominic Cummings, was justified by the government on the grounds that the UK needed to be “match fit” for major international events starting this autumn, including the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, and Britain’s hosting next year of the UN climate change conference.Officials said the new department would be more joined up, focused and coherent.But that rationale was questioned by development experts. Kevin Watkins, the chief executive of Save the Children UK, said: “A prime minister can require that government departments talk to each other. A prime minister can set up coordinating mechanisms to ensure that that happens. What this is about is a shift in priorities.“Merging DfID, the world’s leading aid agency, into the Foreign Office in the midst of a pandemic that threatens to reverse hard-won gains in child survival, nutrition and poverty is reckless, irresponsible and a dereliction of UK leadership.”In practice, the Foreign Office has been slowly taking control of the aid budget, either by directly spending more of its cash, or in-country diplomats being put in charge of the budget.As part of the last reshuffle, the Foreign Office and aid department ministers were required to work in both departments. The new department will have only one permanent secretary, and no redundancies are expected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0b3422b4254b670c76c8ae4e817a42c4876422/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca13ffb647fb96662048026fb01db1c1","title":"moods discoveries and sharing tips and tricks to make the most of your spotify listening","story":"Get more out of your streaming with these simple hacks, from curated lists to podcasts by the shedloadHow to use Spotify: hit play, ensure ears are on.

Barely a gym lets a cross-training machine go unaccompanied by hi-NRG dance tunes. There’s a great choice of running playlists on Spotify, some with millions of likes from users who’ve found that the right music can push them farther and faster. Bruce Springsteen has even written a whole album about being born to run. But if you want to use music to help improve your running, it’s important to get to grips with the science, and how it applies to your running style.Given that most runners tend to follow a pace of 150 to 180 steps per minute, you need music that corresponds to that. One option is to pick music that has about 150-180bpm, so that you can match your steps to the beat. “Foo Fighters’ The Pretender, which has about 170bpm, is really, really popular with runners,” says Hallett.However, 150-180bpm is very fast in terms of tempo, so there’s relatively little recorded at those speeds – with the exception of more high-energy rock’n’roll, thrash metal or speed garage. So another option is to aim for music that matches your stride cycle – ie two steps rather than one. This lets you pick music that’s much slower. Something that’s particularly good? Hip-hop.One of the most pleasant ways to run is to do so in what’s known as a “flow state”. It’s a highly enjoyable feeling of being completely immersed in what you’re doing to the point where it’s as though you’re on autopilot, but which is in itself highly enjoyable. It’s also been shown to enhance running endurance.Karageorghis did a study where he ran people to exhaustion during a beep test and found that those who listened to music more easily entered flow state. But in order to enter flow state, it’s important to have the right listening experience. The more continuous the listening experience, the easier it is to enter flow state. So if you’re planning to go on a reasonably lengthy run, it’s best to avoid music with ads, and to ensure you’re not listening in a way that might be interrupted by poor signal. Using Spotify Premium, with ad-free music and offline listening, is one way to keep the flow state flowing, if you will. “Having interrupted music can be a little distracting and disconcerting – it’s not as beneficial as having continuous music,” says Karageorghis. “That’s why I often encourage people to create end-to-end playlists that contour their workout.”One of the most important ways that music can help take your running to the next level is by making you feel less tired when you exercise. When you’re listening to a soundtrack, you’re giving your brain something to process other than your physical activity. The music distracts it from focusing on the effect exercise is having on your body, so the parts of the brain that speak to each other to communicate fatigue are less able to do so – meaning you feel less exhausted than you otherwise would.“It’s as though the music takes up some of your brain’s bandwidth that would normally be used for communication with the working muscles and the organs,” says Karageorghis. “It limits the degree to which fatigue-related signals can enter conscious awareness.”One thing that is unaffected by how fast you’re running is music’s ability to make you feel like you’re enjoying yourself. Even at higher intensities, studies have found that music can make people enjoy exercise more than they otherwise would.Karageorghis has also found that not only does music enhance how pleasurable your run is, but it enhances your memory of your run. It makes you remember your runs more positively, associates them more with being positive experiences and increases your probability of running more frequently. As to the right type of music to ensure that your brain responds positively to running? That depends entirely on you.“It’s often to do with the personal associations that the music has for you,” says Hallett. “I had a participant who listened to music from their university days because it took them back to a time when they had less responsibility. Going on a run felt like a bit of escapism for them. Others were motivated by music that reminded them of people they knew. It depends what has meaning to you.”Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

It’s the backdrop to everything from Saturday-morning pancakes to extended family get-togethers.\u0026nbspI grew up with my Nigerian parents, listening to a mix of jazz-infused African highlife, UB40 and Madonna. Along with my sisters and brothers, I loved to go through my dad’s vinyl collection in the living-room cabinet – while Stevie Wonder’s Happy Birthday would be pulled out for every anniversary celebration.My husband and I met dancing in a West End bar to 90s R\u0026ampB – think Faith Evans, Blackstreet, Puff DaddyDiddy and Ginuwine, interspersed with a touch of house, dancehall and reggae. Yep.So it was more than interesting to spend the week using Spotify’s Premium Family plan, where our music tastes and those of our two children could come together on the exclusive Family Mix feature.With the Premium Family subscription you can have up to six Premium accounts for family members living at the same address.The Family Mix then picks a selection of songs and genres that anyone on the plan has listened to, and creates a playlist.To a certain extent, my Jamaican husband and I have similar tastes when it comes to music – he will basically listen to anything with a reggae “riddim” put over it – whether it’s Beenie Man, Celine Dion or Westlife.But alongside the likes of Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men and Mark Ronson, a few surprises did pop up and I couldn’t help but wonder if there was a hidden message he was trying to convey. Like most people, the type of music I listen to depends on my mood, so when the Family Mix revealed hubby had been listening to You Win Again by the Bee Gees, I couldn’t help but smile, taking it that he had conceded defeat after a recent disagreement.\u0026nbspThe last time I played the Bee Gees to my daughter, she was six and it was less How Deep Is Your Love and more Tragedy. Their infamous high-pitched singing style did not sit well with her and she recoiled in horror asking: “What is that?”, followed by “Make it stop!”She’s now the grand old age of 10 and teetering on the edge of that weird “not quite a teenager but I want to give you the attitude of one” stage. Luckily, this time around, she had less of a profound reaction and allowed the song to play until the end.Her personal taste in music is the result of a mix of influences: her peers, favourite YouTubers and what’s popular on the online interactive gaming app, Roblox. Being younger than 13, I’m still choosing the songs for her on my profile, and that definitely came in handy when she attempted to add some of Melanie Martinez’s more unsavoury-themed songs to her playlist. Whatever she does choose still feeds into the Family Mix, so nothing is lost from her sharing my account.My youngest recently turned three, and we had a little boogie to the Family Mix in the dining room as he enjoyed his birthday breakfast. The planned barbecue was put on hold thanks to the good old British weather, but we still managed to enjoy ourselves. The Family Mix was in full flow, throwing up hits from Destiny’s Child, Janet Jackson, 112, Ariana Grande, Anne-Marie and Years \u0026amp Years – a mix of old-school classics which my tweenager enjoyed, and some more current hits for her to sing along to at the top of her voice.She always fails to reign in her surprise at seeing me singing along to artists of the moment like Billie Eilish. I mean, as her mum, I couldn’t possibly be that cool, right? We also had fun with the option to change up the tempo of the Family Mix depending on your mood, or the occasion.A moon sign represents the option for a chilled and laid-back selection, then simply tap on the sun for something a little more upbeat and fast-paced – clicking off either takes you back to the standard mix.Our week is up, but you can guarantee we’ll still be tuning in for some family listening.Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

Face coverings have also been recommended more widely, including in Scotland, in cases where social distancing is difficult.“The main issue is that people who are deaf and have hearing loss rely heavily on visual clues for effective communication – that includes body language, gestures, facial expression and lip-reading,” said Ayla Ozmen, head of research and policy at Action on Hearing Loss. “British sign language (BSL) users also rely heavily on seeing lip patterns as well as facial expressions to understand BSL.”While those who are travelling on public transport in England with someone who relies on lip-reading are exempt from wearing face coverings, something Action on Hearing Loss welcomed, Ozmen said little had been done to publicise this, raising concerns that those legitimately not wearing masks may face abuse.And there are other problems, Ozmen said, noting the rules around masks and face coverings in hospitals come into conflict with the accessible information standard, which puts an obligation on health and social care providers to meet people’s communications needs.People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.“We absolutely understand the public health need for wearing PPE but there is also a really significant concern, a safety concern, if people aren’t able to communicate,” said Ozmen.Holly Parker, an 18-year-old from Essex who is profoundly deaf and largely relies on lip reading, said she had encountered problems as a result of face coverings.“My main method of communication is taken away. In shops I am no longer able to understand shopkeepers and this causes me a lot of anxiety,” she said, adding that she was deeply worried about the prospect of going to university if face masks had to be used during practical lessons. Deaf charities, including Action on Hearing Loss, said they welcomed the development of transparent masks, something Parker and others said would make life easier if widely used.Philip Gerrard, chief executive at Deaf Action, said the charity had been testing several prototypes of transparent face masks within the deaf community and hoped it would shortly roll these out to members of staff, clients and the wider community.“We would also like to see the government support the development of deaf-friendly face masks that are PPE approved in hospitals and care settings throughout the UK,” he said.Ian Noon, head of policy at the National Deaf Children’s Society, agreed, adding: “In the meantime, if people pick up some deaf awareness tips like being patient, writing things down or using gestures if a deaf person needs them to, this would also have a big impact.”The deafness, cognition and language research centre at University College London also issued a statement calling for greater awareness of the challenges around hearing difficulties and face masks, but said transparent face shields were a better solution, because they let the whole face be seen.But, it added, dialogue with deaf communities was crucial, noting: “Deaf and hard-of-hearing people are best placed to advise on design needs and ensure any products are fit for purpose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe8e8ce99b69ce23ccf78230135013ad5d5bebc/0_224_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afac84bd8f94a5ef40ac5f60196cbcb6","title":"arthur ashe was so much more than a great tennis player","story":"A new film about the only black man to win Wimbledon, by Indian film-maker Ashok Amritraj, tells the story of his civil activismHe was a professional tennis player, who represented India – the country of his birth – at Wimbledon and the US Open, before becoming one of Hollywood’s biggest players, producing films with stars from Cate Blanchett to Angelina Jolie. Now Ashok Amritraj is recalling his earlier career by making a major feature film about Arthur Ashe, the American athlete who became the only black man to win Wimbledon.What gives the film a special touch is that Amritraj himself played Ashe in the mid-1970s in St Louis, Missouri. He lost, but his admiration for his opponent, both on and off the court, remains undimmed. He describes him as a “charismastic” player, as well as “a gentleman and an intellectual” in person.Ashe grew up at a time when men and women were refused entry to tennis clubs because of the colour of their skin. He first played tennis aged seven in a segregated playground near his home in Richmond, Virginia. His early potential was spotted by Walter Johnson, who coached him.He went on to triumph at Wimbledon in 1975, beating the favourite, Jimmy Connors – in a 6-1, 6-1, 5-7, 6-3 victory remembered as “a tactical masterpiece” – as well as winning the US and Australian open titles. In his memoir Days of Grace, Ashe wrote that Connors had smacked the ball “with a force that bordered on vindictiveness”. But this will be a film as much about Ashe’s achievements in battling discrimination.Ashe once said: “From what we get, we can make a living … What we give, however, makes a life.”He died in 1993, aged just 49. During his heart-bypass surgery, he became infected with HIV following a tainted blood transfusion. Amritraj, born in Chennai, began playing tennis aged seven, eventually competing in the 1970s at Wimbledon, in the junior finals as well as playing in the seniors, and on the winning team of the World Team Tennis Championship in 1978.His brothers, Vijay and Anand, also became professional tennis players. For the first time in Wimbledon history, three brothers played at the same time.But making films had been Ashok Amritraj’s childhood dream. When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1975, his status as a tennis ace introduced him to studio executives and actors such as Sidney Poitier and Dustin Hoffmann, who were good tennis players. Aged 26, he ended his sports career to make films, beginning with small-scale productions.Through Hyde Park Entertainment, the company he founded in 1999, he has become one of Hollywood’s foremost producers, collaborating with every major studio. Films include Bandits, a comedy with Blanchett, Original Sin, a thriller with Jolie, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, and Shopgirl, a comic drama with Steve Martin and Claire Danes.He spoke of wanting to preserve the legacy of Ashe for future generations. Kevin Willmott, the Oscar-winning writer, is now working on the screenplay. Amritraj is planning some “interesting casting” for the lead role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d14027a6e030d7132f9f891351ac51db19cf23f/263_0_4400_2642/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86010f0267665ee72532daf841342234","title":"contract situation is an absolute circus says rugby players association","story":"English club rugby union is in chaos with some players being given 24-hour ultimatums to sign new contracts in order to exploit a loophole in the new salary cap rules. The Rugby Players’ Association says it is working around the clock to help hundreds of players who risk falling foul of their employers if they do not agree to rip up their current contracts.“It’s an absolute circus … I’ve never known anything like it,” said Hopley, who is particularly concerned for middle- and lower-income players who have been contacting the union seeking advice. “We have situations where players are being given contracts and told they have 24 hours to sign them. It beggars belief.“We’re talking about the next three years of a player’s life. In what other walk of life would you be given 24 hours to sign a contract with barely any time for consultation? The upshot is that we’re on calls pretty much 24-7.”There are suggestions that between a third and a half of Premiership players could be reluctant to abandon their existing deals. The RPA, which had a blistering public exchange of views with the leading club owners last week, also fears massive damage is being done to the reputation of the sport.“You’ve got young men, starting out their rugby careers, who are looking around thinking: ‘What have I signed up to?’” Hopley said. “People talk about living the dream. I’m not sure there is much of a dream at the moment.With rumours also circulating that some club owners would not be too unhappy if a couple of their rivals folded, thus ensuring a bigger slice of the central pie for those still standing, Hopley also rejects the theory that the crisis has been largely caused by the top players’ excessive wage demands.“The economic model for club rugby was broken and the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed all the faultlines. But the players didn’t create that. When owners talk about players on vastly inflated wages I’m saying: ‘Yes, but you’re the person who signed those off.’ I know the world has changed but why can’t there be a collective agreement where the clubs and the players are aligned and say: ‘We’re all in this together?’ It’s the unreasonableness of it all that we’ve found most galling.”The situation is further complicated by a shortage of other options for players who choose to exert their legal right to walk away from an employer who reneges on an existing contract. With every club in the country facing significant financial pain if the coronavirus outbreak does not ease soon, only the fortunate few will be able to find lucrative deals in France or Japan.“Some clubs are doing a really good job in terms of explaining the numbers, as any reasonable employer would do,” Hopley said.“When you hear about the English and French clubs and their respective unions going at each other like a pack of hungry wolves at this week’s World Rugby forum, we’re not in a great place as a sport in terms of how we’re conducting ourselves.”The English clubs, however, insist it is the unions who should change their tune if talks over a new global fixture calendar are to be successful. A PRL spokesman said the clubs still felt they were not being listened to as equal partners and remain against switching the July Test window to October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b1fb6cb93a40d93a614379d7af53e3e9df7d61d/0_199_5964_3578/master/5964.jpg?width=1140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=759b2709eb04e3f9c87103348298dce6 1140w","title":"spides review flop international cooperation syfy","story":"Falk Hentschel and Florence Kasumba look good screeching around in a vintage Merc in this SyFy US-German co-production. But it fails to impressAfter Swedish-Danish collaboration in The Bridge and British-American espionage in The Night Manager, international TV co-productions have developed a reputation for cosmopolitan sophistication. Not this one.As Buffy the Vampire Slayer settles into a new home on All4, the Syfy channel needs a different lure for audiences unsatisfied with endless reruns of Star Trek: Voyager. Auditioning for that role is Spides, an original commission, set in Berlin, with an English-language script, credited to the German showrunner Rainer Matsutani and featuring a cast of German, American and indeed German-American actors. The result is often clunky. But then sci-fi’s B-movie heritage means it can get away with a certain amount of clunk … right?Young Nora Berger (played by former Game of Thrones Sand Snake Rosabell Laurenti Sellers) dreams of walking on the surface of a fiery alien planet, then wakes in a hospital bed, attended by a creepy, white-coat-wearing neurologist (the Austrian Susanne Wuest) and remembering nothing about who she is or how she got there. Meanwhile, in a nearby strobe-lit nightclub called Rapture, revellers dressed in PVC and dog collars (is this a fetish night? Or are they just German? It’s unclear) grind up against each other and pass around a new synthetic drug called Blis, which seems to work by inducing audio-visual hallucinations, as well as the occasional coma. That’s some bad trip.Observing it all from a spot at the bar, like the narc he so clearly is, stands Det Leonhart (Falk Hentschel). He too wants a hit of this eye-drop-administered drug that all the cool kids are talking about. “You’re ghosting,” Leonhart is informed by a friendly dealer, when he begins to see the face of some lost love everywhere. “Ghosting” sounds like an intriguing sci-fi plot device. If only it was developed further.So drugs are bad, got it. But despite various aesthetic similarities to a Nancy Reagan-era after-school special, the anti-drugs message isn’t really at the forefront here. Spides’ most overt influence isn’t even sci-fi, it’s gritty cop drama, especially once Leonhart teams up with Nique Navar (Black Panther’s Florence Kasumba), a strikingly beautiful detective from the missing-persons ision.You have to admit these two look good together, screeching around the city’s most graffiti-covered warehouse districts in a vintage Mercedes, with the Berlin television tower providing a suitably extraterrestrial backdrop. Sadly their run-arounds are interrupted by the demands of a hokey plot that requires the regular bumping of heads with superior officers over protocol, and the menacing of surly suspects using unconventional interview techniques.Kasumba is particularly let down by the script’s insinuation that her character’s chief investigative skill is being a total fox. If the blunt delivery and tight trousers initially put you in mind of Saga from The Bridge, all such flattering comparisons evaporate by the time Navar starts purring at lab technicians: “I thought we were friends, Arjan” and getting the reply: “Well, we could have been … if you hadn’t unmatched me on Tinder.”The acting is uniformly wooden, but when the direction has so many inexplicable choices (why would he be standing there?) it seems unfair to lay the blame for this with the onscreen talent. Take Nora’s “bratty” little brother, for instance these wise-ass adolescents are disappointingly common in otherwise quality TV shows and always unwatchable, even if the actor involved is capable of delivering a natural-sounding line of dialogue.It’s the science fiction, though, that Syfy viewers come for – intriguing ideas, whether startlingly original or simply well-executed. Spides does have some of these. The suggestion that police corruption might be caused by alien invaders is particularly comforting at the moment, while Nora’s screams (accompanied by her eyes turning pitch-black) lead to some thrillingly chaotic gore, involving an ambulance ambush and a possessed jogger.There’s a nod to Invasion of the Body Snatchers here, a touch of The Matrix there. Just enough so that, if you had never seen an episode of Stranger Things, you might be able to convince yourself that this is what a respectful genre homage looks like. I’ve watched ahead and there are more entertaining moments as the series gets into its stride. The question is whether you can be bothered to wade through all the dross to get there?Perhaps you’re a more dedicated sci-fi fan than me. I’ll probably just stick with Star Trek: Voyager."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f7536e913e3879a391a9130ca73200242c0d6bd/0_236_4921_2953/master/4921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57c186b8189987493b9fe592e50e9f58","title":"trans people voting november election","story":"Difficulties in obtaining identification mean large numbers of potential voters are vulnerable to disenfranchisementWhen My-Linh moved from Texas to New York, they knew they wanted to vote in elections without risk of discrimination against their non-binary identity. But the only options on the form to get a state ID are male and female.“The system set in place is very unfair, and it doesn’t give any opportunity for people who have intersectional identities to be able to feel comfortable to identify themselves,” says My-Linh.Few states in the US have passed a law requiring voting registration forms to include an X or unspecified option for anyone who doesn’t identify as male or female. Only 18 states and Washington DC have that option when getting a driver’s license – neither Texas nor New York, where My-Linh would vote, do.For non-binary people, as well as the transgender community as a whole, barriers to getting an appropriate ID leave hundreds of thousands of people vulnerable to disenfranchisement.The 2015 US Trans Survey also found that a third of the people who showed ID which didn’t match their gender presentation faced negative results such as harassment or even assault – something that can discourage transgender and non-binary people from casting a ballot.Allison, a trans femme who had recently moved to California before the November 2016 elections, had not changed her gender marker due to the high cost of the paperwork. Though she had registered online, poll workers asked for her ID, citing their reasoning being it was her first time voting in the state which does not have strict voter ID laws. She only received a provisional ballot, meaning her vote may not have counted.“Having to have photo identification to show up at the polls disproportionately affects our transgender populations,” says Arli Christian, Campaign Strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union who focuses on trans justice issues. “For transgender folks, it is often very difficult to get an ID that accurately reflects who they are, has a legal name that corresponds with who they are, and has a gender marker that matches who they are.”The high rate of inaccurate IDs doesn’t come from a lack of trying. Trans people face a complicated and expensive ordeal involving legal fees, a potential need to publish their name in the newspaper – thus outing them – and sharing invasive medical documentation. Most states, including New York, require publishing changed names in a newspaper for creditors and other interested parties. In some states gender markers can’t be changed without proof of surgery.Earlier this year a 28-year-old transgender woman sued North Carolina and Mecklenburg county election officials after facing discrimination while voting last November. While the state doesn’t require identification for voting, the woman, who has lived as a female since the age of 14, was asked to present her ID. When asked why it was required, she said the precinct judge said: “Because your face doesn’t match your name.”She was finally allowed to vote after over an hour but was emotionally shaken up.“These voter ID laws are a solution in search of a problem and all they really do in the end is make it harder for people to vote,” says Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, deputy executive director for policy and action at the National Center for Transgender Equality and a transgender man.Heng-Lehtinen was out as a transgender man and going by Rodrigo for five years before he could legally change his name. “Everyone knew me as that. That’s how I was recognized in the world, with my job, my friends, my family, everyone. But there was no government document that reflected that,” he says.He had to go through a DMV and Social Security Administration in California before eventually reaching the California court system. The cost was about $450. Something he stresses is “extremely out of reach for many transgender people who disproportionately are more likely to work low-wage jobs”.“Transgender people are disproportionately subject to discrimination, so it’s harder for us to find a job and we’re put into more desperate situations. A lot of transgender people are doing sex work or other jobs like that just to get by, which then makes us more likely to be in prison,” says Heng-Lehtinen.With the presidential election less than six months away, advocates are hoping that some measures can be taken to make it easier for transgender and non-binary people to vote. David advocated for changing state laws to make it easier to change voter forms and IDs. Christian said poll workers should be educated about IDs so they don’t bar someone from voting, and hoped that a national conversation would continue.“If there’s a gender discrepancy between your ID and the way you walk through the world, that is not a reason to be denied a ballot,” said Christian. “We need to make sure that as a community, as a society, we understand trans people. Our democracy is strongest when all people have access to vote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d1a59559ece4af111e61c7ffe6b737db58164cb/0_566_2757_1655/master/2757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8838f2af25d30e0dfb2445a32f7f6163","title":"carlos lehder rivas medellin cartel transferred germany","story":"Carlos Lehder Rivas ran Medellín cartel alongside Pablo Escobar that smuggled cocaine worth billions to the US in 1970s and 80sThe man who co-founded the notorious Colombian Medellín drug cartel alongside Pablo Escobar has been transferred to Germany from the United States, according to Spiegel Online.Carlos Lehder Rivas, who has both German and Colombian citizenship, was escorted to Germany by two US officials on a regular passenger flight from New York to Frankfurt and handed over to German authorities, the report said.At the centre of Lehder’s operation was Norman’s Caye, an island off the Bahamas, which he transformed into the hub of his smuggling operation with the help of corrupt local officials.As the threat of extradition to the US grew, Lehder – a self-described admirer of Adolf Hitler –formed his own far-right political party, the Latino National party, in the hope of stirring nationalist anger over the idea of Colombians facing trial in a foreign court.In a dramatic twist, Escobar tipped off authorities to Lehder’s whereabouts, leading to his arrest and extradition to the US in 1987.The following year, Lehder was sentenced by a US court to life plus 135 years in prison but later cooperated with the authorities and was put in a witness protection programme.As he has already served his time in the US, he would not be asked to answer again to the same charges before a German court.Spiegel reported that 70-year-old Lehder, whose father is German, would be placed under the care of a charitable group in Germany.Germany’s interior and foreign ministries were not immediately available for comment on the case when contacted by AFP.Escobar was killed by Colombian police in 1993 while on the run to avoid extradition to the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/205bc504825c4cf8e771c994e0f05d837e654d60/0_93_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0997edd05a3a61b6b807d2efdac20a3","title":"coronavirus vaccine trial by imperial college london begins","story":"Professor says early vaccines may not stop virus being contracted but prevent recipients developing severe Covid-19 illnessResearchers at Imperial College London will this week begin clinical trials of a possible coronavirus vaccine in 300 people.The healthy participants, aged between 18 and 70, will all receive two doses of the vaccine over the coming weeks, and the hopes is that tests could then move on to 6,000 volunteers if there is an effective immune response.Rather than giving people a weakened form of the illness, the Imperial vaccine instead uses synthetic strands of genetic code based on the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the “novel coronavirus” responsible for the pandemic.Robin Shattock, the Imperial College London professor leading its development, has told Bloomberg that early protective vaccines might not completely stop a person contracting the virus. “Is that protection against infection? Is it protection against illness? Is it protection against severe disease? It’s quite possible a vaccine that only protects against severe disease would be very useful.”When injected, the Imperial experimental vaccine instructs muscle cells to produce virus proteins to protect against future infection. In animal tests, the vaccine was shown to be safe and showed “encouraging signs of an effective immune response”, Shattock’s team said.The research has been funded by £41m from the UK government, as well as £5m of other donations, and comes after a separate vaccine from experts at Oxford University started undergoing human clinical trials.With Press Association and Reuters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6138e142deb3462d598fcb4d71d488f9717deed1/0_210_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56588440ac0c9e35ab5872bdee3a30a2","title":"dont blame public for covid 19 spread says uk scientist","story":"Exclusive: Prof John Drury says cooperation more prevalent than selfish behaviourFrom empty supermarket shelves to crowded parks, public behaviour has come in for criticism during the Covid-19 outbreak.But blaming the spread of Covid-19 on selfishness or thoughtless behaviour is misguided and distracts from the real causes of fatalities, according to one of Britain’s leading behavioural psychologists. In April the UK government set out these five tests it said had to be met before they would consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Prof John Drury, a member of a subgroup to the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said evidence shows that rather than mass panic or selfishness in times of emergency, people actually tend to show solidarity and cooperation.The findings of surveys suggesting that adherence to lockdown measures in the UK is falling, particularly among younger adults, were unlikely to be down to selfishness, said Drury, noting the drop coincided with a decline in confidence in the government.Drury told the  that public behaviour had often been misrepresented. “It is implicit in some politicians comments, but it was more often commentators, journalistic commentators, saying these kinds of things,” said Drury. Drury’s comments come as he and colleagues published a commentary in the British Journal of Social Psychology arguing that “psychologising” disasters obscures the true causes of bad outcomes and instead blames victims.The team add that the government itself raised concerns the public would “fatigue” of lockdown and flout rules, if brought in too early. Delays in introducing lockdown have since been criticised for increasing the death toll. The team argue that better explanations for the high Covid-19 death toll in the UK than public behaviour include lockdown being implemented too late because of under-reaction by politicians, as well as systemic problems such as poverty and other inequalities putting certain groups at risk, and failures of communication, including an early focus on self-protection rather than on protecting others.“Despite media campaigns to vilify some people as selfish and thoughtless ‘covidiots’, the evidence on reasons for non-adherence shows that much of it was practical rather than psychological,” the team write, noting those living in cities often had no alternative but to exercise in crowded parks.Drury said such portrayals of public behaviour could lead to ision in communities and a lack of commitment to measures crucial to tackling the outbreak.“Where people think that others are not acting as one, that undermines the unity we need,” said Drury.Such concerns were highlighted by experts in connection with the actions of Dominic Cummings who drove his family to Durham when his wife had coronavirus and subsequently drove to Barnard Castle during lockdown to test his eyesight.Unity, Drury stressed, will be crucial as lockdown is relaxed while the success of the test-and-trace system hinges on public trust in the authorities administering and running it.Drury said he is concerned about a possible second wave of the virus, noting the test-and-trace system is not fully operational, while even now some people are interpreting government messaging as meaning they don’t need to adhere so strictly to some regulations.“Public behaviour is key, but public behaviour is always mediated by government actions, government messaging and how people interpret those,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e995f2ab2e635127181319e0817f0b43b8eddd6a/513_1529_2644_1587/master/2644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=990e6bad8c163a7e3b2bdb6908166613","title":"color is not a new york black lives matter street art in pictures","story":"Across the US, artists have responded to the death of George Floyd and the ensuing protests with impactful and urgent work.

Eight per cent agreed with the statement “It’s too early to say,” while 2 per cent had no opinion.

Last week, Minister for Education Joe McHugh said if two-metre social distancing remained in place, pupils would be able to go to school for only one day a week in September. He said this would not be acceptable to the Government and an alternative plan for reopening would be drawn up.However, a huge majority of voters (88 per cent) say the Government has done a good job handling the pandemic, while just 9 per cent say it has not done a good job. Voters also agree with the pace of the Government’s reopening plan – just 20 per cent of voters say the plan is moving too quickly, while 12 per cent say it is moving too slowly. Two-thirds of voters (66 per cent) say the plan is “moving at about the right pace”.The poll was conducted among more than 1,200 respondents between June 11th and 14th. The accuracy level is estimated to be about plus or minus 2.8 per cent. This poll was conducted by telephone, owing to coronavirus restrictions. Previous polls have been conducted through face-to-face interviews.Covid-19 figuresMeanwhile, a total of three new deaths of patients with Covid-19 were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Tuesday.This brings to 1,709 the total number of deaths linked to the disease in the Republic.

Photograph: Andrew Parsons10 Downing StreetAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union is preparing to redouble efforts and work through the summer to hammer out a deal with Britain following a meeting between prime minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders on Monday.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel and David Sassoli, president of the European Parliament, held a video conference with the British leader to take stock of the lack of progress in the talks, with just six months remaining before barriers to trade between Britain and its neighbours make an abrupt return, after decades spent removing them.The political leadership on both sides sent the message to their negotiators to go back over the areas where they had encountered stumbling blocks and try again to see if they can inch their way to a compromise that would avoid the most drastic ‘no trade deal’ option.“We agreed . . . that new momentum was required,” Ms von der Leyen said following the meeting.The mood in Brussels was upbeat towards the prospects of reaching a deal following the meeting, with those working close to the negotiations expecting a summer of late-night marathon talks that would likely run through the traditional holiday period.\u0026nbspBritain had initially briefed that it would abandon attempts to find a deal at this stage if it felt insufficient progress had been made, and focus its work instead on preparing for an automatic switch from January 1st to World Trade Organisation terms – a global default system of tariffs expected to cause a significant blow to trade.London’s shift away from this position and commitment to the talks has been taken as an indication that a deal can be found.Joint statementIn a joint statement following the meeting, both sides committed to “create the most conducive conditions for concluding and ratifying a deal before the end of 2020”.“The parties underlined their intention to work hard to deliver a relationship which would work in the interests of the citizens of the union and of the United Kingdom, ” the joint statement read. “They also confirmed their commitment to the full and timely implementation of the withdrawal agreement.”The two sides have agreed to six rounds of negotiations between June 29th and August 21st, held physically if possible and alternating between London and Brussels. Since February, negotiations have been over video conference because of the pandemic, ruling out informal side chats that often help find common ground.Sticking points include fishing rights and fair competition provisions for business.On policing and security co-operation, a way through could be possible, as the EU is open to workarounds through the international policing co-operation body Interpol. However, this would be a far more distant kind of co-operation than once hoped for.The British side has bridled at insistence by the EU that the deal should contain a commitment to uphold the Paris Climate Accord, insisting that this goes far beyond the stipulations of past trade deals. But in the EU’s view, modern-day trade deals have evolved to include such commitments, and they are appropriate because Britain is a like-minded country that has signed up to the agreement anyway.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  Christof StacheAFP via Getty ImagesAn announcement by US president Donald Trump that the US will pull thousands of troops from Germany in a symbolic blow to the postwar order has overshadowed talks by defence ministers from Nato countries this week.The declaration, which Trump cast as retaliation against Germany for unspecified trade grievances and its failure to reach a Nato defence spending target of 2 per cent of GDP, caught allies off guard, and was seen as another sign of US retreat from the powerful transatlantic alliance that shaped the 20th century.It came immediately before a two-day summit of Nato defence ministers, along with allies Finland, Sweden and Australia, and the EU’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, who are due to discuss preparations for a possible second wave of coronavirus, an increasingly assertive China, and Russia’s increased development of nuclear weapons.Allies and US diplomats are keen to publicly play down the significance of the US pulling out the 9,500 troops from Germany, noting that the US had previously increased its presence in the Balkans and in eastern Europe. However, if followed through on the move would be a deep rebuke to a major ally and trading partner at a time of multiplying security threats on the EU’s borders.\u0026nbspIt would increase uncertainty in a foundational aspect of European security – the assumption that the US would defend Nato members against any Russian incursion – which Trump has repeatedly undermined since before taking office.The decision was leaked to media before Mr Trump announced it, and Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said he had called the US leader over the phone to emphasise the importance of the transatlantic alliance – apparently to no avail.“My message was that the US presence in Europe, it’s good for Europe, but it’s also good for North America and the United States because the transatlantic bond is essential to the strength and the success of the alliance,” he told reporters.“It is good for Europe because the presence of troops...that’s the core of the transatlantic alliance. The US presence in Europe is not only about protecting Europe, but it’s also about projecting US power beyond Europe.” Defence forcesMr Trump has repeatedly accused European allies of freeloading on the US for security by not paying for their own defence forces.In a briefing to journalists the US ambassador to Nato, Kay Bailey Hutchison, said Germany had been a “good partner” but needed to step up. “They know they need to do more in defence spending. Their defence ministers have said so, Chancellor Merkel has said so.” Under the Trump administration the US has beat a retreat from old alliances and decades of international co-operation as the president has abruptly withdrawn from international agreements and lashed out at allies.This has forced the EU to try to recalibrate its international relations, and to try to forge united European positions that can defend common interests without relying on the US for support.However, this runs up against the hard reality of a lack of unanimity among the 27 EU members which prevents unanimous stances, and the fact that when it comes to increased defence investment many of Europe’s electorates simply are not interested, and would rather their governments spend their tax euro on something else.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Ample evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4280354.1592308397!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new zealand no longer free of coronavirus as two women test positive","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA health worker wearing a protective suit takes a swab test on a woman in Beijing. Photograph: Noel CelisAFP via Getty ImagesIt took just eight days for New Zealand to lose its Covid-free status when two women who had been given permission to leave quarantine early after arriving from abroad tested positive for the coronavirus, authorities said on Tuesday.New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who has enjoyed enormous popularity for her success at ridding the country of coronavirus infection, said the government would review what happened, but that it was clear checks were not adequate in this case.“Vigorous testing is now taking place across those who were in the quarantine facility at the same time, and those who may have had any, even the remotest chance of contact (with the women),” Ardern said in a Facebook Live post.New Zealand had trumpeted its achievement last week of becoming one of the first countries in the world to eliminate Covid-19 and return to pre-pandemic normality, lifting all social and economic restrictions except border controls.The country requires all people arriving from abroad to quarantine for 14 days to avoid reintroducing the disease. The two women aged in their 30s and 40s had travelled from Britain to visit a dying parent in Wellington on June 7th, the director general of health said in a news conference.Both had gone into quarantine in Auckland after landing, but had been given special permission to leave on compassionate grounds, even though one had symptoms which she attributed to a pre-existing condition. They tested positive after they returned to quarantine.The new cases ended a 24-day streak of no new infections in the country.The country’s health minister David Clark said he was suspending all exemptions to the quarantine rules until he had confidence in the system.“Compassionate exemptions should be rare and rigorous and it appears that this case did not include the checks that we expected to be happening. That’s not acceptable.”One family member of the women has been isolated in Wellington. Staff at the hotel they women lived in would be tested. Co-passengers on their flight, staff at Auckland airport and anyone else whom the women met would be contacted.The cases take the total number recorded in the country to 1,506. Deaths from the disease remain at 22, among the lowest in the developed world. BeijingMeanwhile, Beijing has banned high-risk people from leaving the Chinese capital and halted some transportation services to stop the spread of a fresh coronavirus outbreak to other cities and provinces.China’s financial hub of Shanghai demanded some travellers from Beijing be quarantined for two weeks, as 27 new Covid-19 cases took the capital’s current outbreak to 106 since Thursday.That makes it the most serious flare-up in China since February, stoking fears of a second wave of the respiratory disease which emerged in the central city of Wuhan late last year and has now infected more than 8 million people worldwide.“Beijing will take the most resolute, decisive, and strict measures to contain the outbreak,” Xu Hejian, spokesman at the Beijing city government, said at a press conference on Tuesday.The outbreak has been traced to the sprawling Xinfadi wholesale food centre in the southwest of Beijing where thousands of tonnes of vegetables, fruits and meat change hands each day.Beijing had designated 22 neighbourhoods as medium-risk areas as of Monday. Medium-risk areas are required to take stringent measures to block the potential entry of infection.All high-risk groups in Beijing, such as people who are close contacts of confirmed cases, are not allowed to leave the city, state media reported on Tuesday, citing municipal officials.All outbound taxi and car-hailing services have also been suspended. Some long-distance bus routes between Beijing and nearby Hebei and Shandong provinces were suspended.Concerned about contagion risks, many provinces have imposed quarantine requirements on visitors from Beijing.One suspected case who flew from Beijing to southwestern Sichuan province has become a confirmed case, health authorities said on Tuesday, and local officials are rounding up 111 close contacts for observation.Hebei province reported four new cases, with two having come into direct contact with a virus carrier in the Chinese capital, and one being an operator at the Xinfadi market.On Tuesday, Shanghai started to require travellers from medium-to-high risk Covid-19 areas in China to be quarantined for 14 days.The stakes are high for Shanghai, which has been invited to host two Formula One races this season. US airlines are also poised to resumes flights to the city.‘Wartime’ modeWhile not in a Wuhan-style lockdown, the Chinese capital has gone into a “wartime” mode on a district level, with local neighbourhoods instituting 24-hour security checkpoints, closing schools and banning wedding banquets.Overnight, some parts of Beijing including the city’s old-style hutong neighbourhoods were fenced up, with some imposing single entry points.However, in Huaxiang, the only neighbourhood currently designated as high-risk, some residents demanded officials impose more stringent contact tracing protocols.Officials were relying on people to identify themselves as having visited the Xinfadi centre 9 kilometres away, residents said.Globally, more than 8 million cases have been recorded, and 436,000 deaths. The US is the worst-hit country, with more than two million cases. More contagiousYang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told state media he believed the new Beijing outbreak to be of a more contagious strain than the one that hit Wuhan at the beginning of the pandemic. The World Health Organisation’s emergencies director, Mike Ryan, said he expected Chinese authorities to publish the genetic sequencing of the virus in Beijing and supported their efforts so far. “A cluster like this is a concern and it needs to be investigated and controlled - and that is exactly what the Chinese authorities are doing,” he said. On Monday, researchers said they were still investigating the origins of the new outbreak, with some suggesting it had come from overseas. State-run newspapers reported that the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at Beijing’s Xinfadi market amid worries about a second wave of the pandemic in China. Mr Ryan said in a briefing that he would be “reticent” to say that packaging needs to be tested as a result of the new infections. His comments echoed those of experts earlier on Monday who said the fish itself was unlikely to carry the disease and any link to salmon may have been the result of cross-contamination. –AgenciesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"disastrous lockdown can never repeated even virus returns","story":"Three months after we entered lockdown, as we tiptoe out to non-essential stores and meet a lonely relative, we can begin to benefit from something previously unavailable – experience. Instead of having to rely entirely on widely varying mathematical models and fight an unknown virus in a fog of uncertainty, governments can start to see what has actually worked in different places around the world.This new situation can have immediate benefits. For instance, we can now see that it is not necessary to have a two-metre separation between people to keep the virus in retreat where it is already at a low level. We know this from the experience of countries such as Denmark, France and Germany where the recommended distance is shorter, and we should not have to spend weeks agonising over it. Great swathes of our hospitality industry could thus be saved.We also know that these and other European countries are continuing to make progress without quarantining people entering from low-risk countries nearby, and can therefore concentrate on testing arrivals and stopping people coming from high-risk places. So the rather belated decision to require everyone arriving in the UK to quarantine themselves for two weeks ought soon to be ditched.We can also begin to discern the true cost of a national lockdown, not just in economic but in human terms. The unemployment figures about to be released represent a personal catastrophe for hundreds of thousands of people. Large rounds of corporate redundancies mean worse is to come. For many iniduals, lockdown is going to mean depression, family breakdown and despair.On top of this, we can now be sure that there will be tens of thousands of undetected cancers. Evidence is mounting that domestic abuse is rising, and mental health deteriorating. Dental standards will have dropped sharply, with lasting consequences. Above all, the education and development of millions of young people has been severely damaged, and they will carry the scars of that for the rest of their long lives.We now know therefore that a lockdown is not a temporary blip or a paid holiday, but a disaster for our society. It is increasing inequality, social tension, and unaffordable debt. Globally, the World Bank has estimated that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty. Such a disaster cannot under any circumstances be repeated. There can be no second lockdown.To use yet another wartime analogy, a lockdown is like Dunkirk – a heroic operation in itself but the result of a massive failure. I am not singling out the Government for that, for this has been a failure at multiple levels: a failure by the whole world to prevent the trading of wild animals for consumption by China to report the initial outbreak openly by our and many other countries to prepare for this type of pandemic.Out of such failure, we have also learned crucial lessons. One of these is that some countries have escaped a good deal of the brutal costs of having to pursue a tight lockdown, even though they are large, complex and open nations. Germany and South Korea are examples that stand out.Furthermore, we can see that these countries have something in common – from the outset they were much more ambitious about testing. South Koreans used a fully-prepared track and trace system at once, and Germans were tested for the virus on a vastly greater scale than the people of Italy, Spain, Britain or America. This is why the Government, correctly, is rolling out a track and trace system here.Yet there is a danger of thinking that that is all we have to do. We should observe that even the South Koreans have sometimes struggled to keep a lid on the virus. And this week’s renewed outbreak in Beijing shows it can easily return just when you think you’ve got rid of it. If it is true that a lockdown represents a massive failure of policy and the costs of it cannot be repeated, and also true that testing has always provided the key to avoiding such failure, then it is time for the British Government to be much more ambitious in its goals.In particular, ministers should listen carefully to Tony Blair. That is not an easy sentence for me to write, given that I spent four years of my life as his official arch-enemy. But the report published earlier this month by his Institute for Global Change argues persuasively for the Government to prepare now for testing on a truly massive scale – involving millions of tests every week as people enter the country, arrive at work, attend conferences or just decide to go out.His argument is that a wide range of rapid tests are now under development and that they can be rolled out faster with Government funding, commitment and accelerated permissions. Many are being developed by British firms. While the cost would run into billions of pounds, it would be very little compared to the costs of one day of lockdown and could even be financed through special bonds.These almost instant point-of-use tests would provide warning of any outbreak and could be used to produce the data necessary to act quickly and avoid further lockdowns. They would be used in conjunction with lab-based tests to pinpoint new cases. This is not an alternative to a track and trace system, but could make that far more likely to be successful.Such a programme would require the harnessing of the resources of many small labs, expanding large ones, and making financial commitments to firms who could manufacture the simpler, mass tests. Taking them would become part of our way of life. But that is better than mass unemployment and widespread other illnesses becoming our way of life instead. Currently, the Government appears to be encouraging employers to adopt such testing but has not made the leap to saying this is an overriding national strategy.It ought to do so, with a Cabinet minister responsible for seeing it through. We have seen enough to know that a lockdown is so destructive that it can only ever be allowed once. That is why we should get out of it as soon as that can safely be done. But it is also why we should prepare, invest and organise to avoid it ever being contemplated again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusiveprivate schools set ignore government open septembercome","story":"It comes as the Government formally admitted in a High Court document, in response to a legal challenge to its lockdown policies, that it was a request, not a direction for schools to close.A governor at one of the country\u0027s leading private schools said headteachers were furious with ministers over their dithering, adding that schools could have legally and safely opened this term.He said: We have had enough. We will definitely open in September using our own hygiene measures, our own risk-based assessment of social distancing and our own test and trace system. There is no confidence left in the Government, given their failed promises.

The Secretary of State has not exercised his powers to make a closure direction in respect of any school.A major barrier to headteachers welcoming more pupils back to the classroom than the year groups stipulated by the Government has been insurance companies refusing to cover schools\u0027 legal liability if they go against the official recommendation.On Tuesday night, the Prime Minister insisted it was safe for pupils to return to school.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"good riddance department blank cheques","story":"So farewell, then, to the Ministry of Blank Cheques or, to give one of Whitehall’s more profligate departments its proper title, the unloved Department for International Development (Dfid).It is not just that Dfid, whose origins date back to former Labour foreign secretary Robin Cook’s commitment to an “ethical foreign policy” in 1997, has managed to ert vast sums to countries like China and Iran, which can hardly be described as well-disposed to Britain. In 2018, for example, British aid to China, a country that is challenging America to become the world’s wealthiest nation, rose by £11.7 million to reach £55.6 million. Iran, meanwhile, which spent most of last summer harassing British merchant shipping in the Gulf, received £16 million.The widespread unhappiness in Whitehall over Dfid stems from the requirement, enshrined in law by David Cameron’s coalition, that officials are legally required to spend the department’s annual budget of around £15 billion, whether or not they have good reason to do so. This is so ministers can boast they have met the United Nations target of spending 0.7 per cent of Gross Domestic Product on aid. This led, in one memorable year, to officials scrambling to spend £3.7 billion in just eight weeks so that the Government could claim it had reached this arbitrary requirement.Boris Johnson’s announcement in the Commons that Dfid will cease to exist as a separate entity therefore represents a long overdue injection of common sense to the proceedings, as his Government seeks to adopt a more holistic approach to Britain’s dealings overseas.Mr Johnson knows well the iniquities of Dfid from his spell as foreign secretary. His radical approach is designed to ensure that, so far as Britain’s global outlook is concerned, the Government will speak with one voice. The creation of the new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in September, effectively a merger between the Foreign Office and Dfid, will hopefully mean that, in future, foreign aid commitments are consistent with Britain’s overall national interests, rather than seeking to undermine them.As the conflicting global response to the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated, we live in an age when rival powers such as China increasingly look to a mixture of soft and hard power options in pursuit of their national goals. So it makes sense that Britain, as it nears the end of the Brexit deadline, seeks to adopt its own more coherent approach.It is estimated that Britain spends something in the region of £70 billion a year promoting and protecting its interests around the world, whether in the form of soft power areas like diplomacy and foreign aid, or more robust options such as deploying our Armed Forces and intelligence-gathering operations. As Mr Johnson reminded MPs, Britain has the third largest diplomatic service and aid budget in the world.And, as the Government seeks to articulate its vision for Global Britain, it is imperative that these important agencies work in unison, instead of constantly pursuing competing agendas.The Government still insists that, even with the merger, it is committed to maintaining foreign aid at the 0.7 per cent level. But with future aid donations being more intimately linked to Britain’s wider diplomatic goals, together with the fact that regional trade directors are to come under the auspices of the new department, there is an expectation that overseas aid commitments will be more closely aligned with key foreign policy objectives.No longer, as happened under Dfid, should British taxpayers hand over vast sums to global bodies like the UN which then use the money to fund projects that are openly critical of British government policy, from race relations to human rights. Instead post-Brexit Britain can use its combined resources to help reform struggling international institutions such as the World Health Organisation, whose global authority has been seriously diminished during the Covid-19 outbreak by its kow-towing to China’s communist leadership.The announcement also needs to be seen within the context of the wider overhaul of Britain’s global approach that is being undertaken in Whitehall as part of Mr Johnson’s “Integrated Review” of our national security infrastructure, which is due to publish its findings this autumn.With US President Donald Trump threatening to scale down America’s military presence in Europe, our increasingly fractious relationship with Russia and China, and Islamist militancy on the rise once again, it is paramount that Britain can defend and protect both its own interests, as well as those of our allies in the US, Europe and beyond.Mr Johnson has admirably shown that he is prepared to take radical measures to improve Britain’s global standing. Let’s hope, then, the Prime Minister shows the same resolve when it comes to making sure the country has the necessary resources in place to safeguard Global Britain.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"welcome republic chaz seattles new socialist commune","story":"He slipped effortlessly out of the role of lawbreaker and into the role of lawman, and then, like the sheriff of a frontier town, established who was boss by delivering an exemplary beating. The exemplar was a graffiti artist, caught spray can in hand by Raz’s deputies. His offence was not vandalizing property, but spraying over another, more favored graffiti artist’s work. Thus the arts flourish under Raz’s enlightened dictatorship.After this bout of frontier justice, Raz and his crew patrolled the frontiers of his kingdom with an AK-47 and a hand gun. The frontiers are marked by some police barricades left over from the recent protests “We are the police now,” they explained to their mostly vegan subjects, who were busying themselves with planting a vegetable plot and circulating recipes for making chlorine gas in case the pigs tried to invade. “We are the leaders.”Imagine if a group of right-wing extremists seceded from the United States, appointed a vigilante enforcer, and circulated recipes for homemade chemical weapons. It is, as the left-wing extremist John Lennon said, not hard to do. Every now and then, some heavily armed bunch of “patriots” from Montana or the Dakotas find themselves in a stand-off with the law. It often ends badly.If the CHAZ utopians sported the red baseball cap of MAGA instead of the black cycle shorts of Antifa, the media would be denouncing them for “white privilege”, if not cask-strength “white supremacy”, and blaming their insurrection on Donald Trump. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would be overhead in their choppers, and SWAT teams would be awaiting orders. Instead, most of the media have reacted with sympathy and admiration, especially after President Trump tweeted that the CHAZ had been taken over by a “Terrorist Warlord”.Raz is more than the sum of his parts, which in this case include a Kalashnikov, a full set of tattoos, and a demo tape. He also manages several short-term lets: he does AirBnB as well as R\u0026ampB. The President had accorded him the highest honour in digital life, a face-to-face tweet-off. Raz went in thumbs flailing.“The President really put a hit on my head,” he complained on Twitter. “I’m not a Terrorist Warlord. Quit spreading that false narrative. The world has NEVER been ready for a strong black man.”The stand-off continued on Thursday evening as Raz’s subjects, exhausted after planting some Brussels sprouts, settled in for movie night (Paris is Burning). The nation is watching, the governor of Washington State is telling Trump to go back to his bunker, and Raz is hamming it up on Twitter like a would-be senator with a deep-fried pork chop at the Iowa State Fair.There is an unreal quality to American life this season of lockdown and looting. Everything is mediated, like a reality television show that has gone off-script. But every now and then, someone gets murdered.Raz Simone might become the next Joe Exotic, the zoo-keeping, feline felon who was the star of the hit series Tiger King. Joe Exotic was also the law: he was chief of police in a small town in Texas before being convicted of cruelty to animals, as well as conspiracy to murder humans. He too aspired to office, in his case as a Libertarian candidate. He too believes in gun rights and dabbles in music too Country, not rap.But Joe Exotic is white and Raz Simone is black. This is still America, even in the CHAZ.“We have been peaceful and nothing else,” Raz appealed to the President. “If I die don’t let it be in vain.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/16/09/annular-solar-eclipse-2020-moon.jpg","title":"annular solar eclipse 2020 live how to watch where date time","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Across large parts of the world on 21 June the sun will create a \u0027ring of fire\u0027 around the moonA rare type of solar eclipse is taking place this week across large parts of the world, as the Sun, Moon and Earth align.The total annular solar eclipse takes place when the moon is too far away in its orbit of the Earth to completely block out the sun, causing light to appear around the edges of the moon.The name annular is derived from the Latin word for ring and the effect it creates has been referred to by astronomers as a “ring of fire”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt takes several minutes for the moon to pass in front of the sun but the total eclipse lasts less than a second.The path of the annular solar eclipse takes it across Africa, Central Asia and South East Asia on Sunday, 21 June. Nasa has made a map of its trajectory, showing where the annular phase of the eclipse will be visible, weather permitting. Millions more will be able to witness a partial solar eclipse, though unfortunately for sky gazers in the UK and US it will not be visible.Details of object that smashed into Moon during lunar eclipse revealed“It’s much more important to watch the weather forecasts a day or two before the eclipse and choose a location with the best chance of a cloud-free sky during the eclipse.“Good weather is the key to successful eclipse viewing – better to see a shorter eclipse from clear sky than a longer eclipse under clouds.”A live stream of the eclipse will be broadcast by Timeanddate, allowing anyone to watch it no matter where they are in the world.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

But the new report attempts to highlight the broader impact on the economy that its digital store has, by giving an account of how many sales are facilitated through those apps more broadly.The new announcement comes amid questions over the scale of app stores run by Apple, Google and other companies. Last week, Axios reported that US antitrust investigators asked Apple whether chief executive Tim Cook would give testimony as part of a probe into competition among tech companies.Apple and Mr Cook have repeatedly said that they welcome the scrutiny of the App Store that has come with increased questions over whether it offers a fair playing field to the apps and companies that rely on it to reach customers.Apple Stores to re-open across UK after coronavirus shutdownSome companies have argued that they are unfairly treated on the App Store, where any payments made are subject to a 30 per cent cut from Apple. That has led some of the biggest firms to opt out of offering in-app purchases entirely, with Netflix and Amazon\u0027s apps directing their customers to their websites if they want to subscribe or purchase, for instance.Apple\u0027s new research showed that such purchases – those made outside of the App Store system, but which were facilitated by apps downloaded from within it – made up the vast majority of the sales that are facilitated by the App Store.More than 85 per cent of the $519 billion total facilitated by the App Store goes entirely to third-party developers and businesses, it said.It pointed to examples such as companies that sell physical goods and services,which together represent the largest share of the total at $413 billion.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Other kinds of commerce apps made up the rest of those physical goods and services, such as transport apps, ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft, and food delivery apps like Just Eat.Away from those physical apps, other digital services such as music and video streaming services which in total represented $61 billion. It is in that area that many companies have opted out of payments through the App Store entirely, with major Apple competitors such as Spotify and Netflix instead choosing to make their customers sign up outside of their apps and then use that log-in on their Apple devices.Those companies have argued that Apple\u0027s own services – which include TV and music streaming services that are direct competitors – are able to gain an unfair advantage because they can be favoured by Apple and do not have to lose any cut taken in purchases through the App Store.Apple also offers the only way of getting new apps onto its iPhones and other hardware, since there is no way to download or install software from other platforms. Apps that sell other apps are banned.Away from physical goods and services and digital subscriptions, advertising made up most of the rest of the total, with marketing being shown on games as well as free apps such as Twitter and Pinterest, alongside those that show apps but also offer subscriptions, like the MLB\u0027s app.China represented almost half of that $519 billion figure, Apple said, with $246 billion of the total. That is in part because of the country\u0027s more developed mobile commerce ecosystem, Apple said, with a variety of services available through a host of apps that operate outside of Apple\u0027s payment systems.The US made up $138 billion, Europe represented $51 billion, Japan accounted for $37 billion and the remaining $47 billion came from the rest of the world.The study was commissioned by Apple but carried out by independent economic consulting firm the Analysis Group.The report only looked at data from 2019, meaning that it did not reflect the changes that have come about as the result of the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting lockdowns.Since then, the company has seen a rise in apps like social, education and business chat tools, as well as food and grocery apps. At the same time, apps that have faced restrictions or require in-person interactions have dropped off, Apple said.Apple\u0027s announcement came just days before its Worldwide Developers Conference, which it uses to highlight the work of those who make apps for its platforms.

MPs recommend that the government should give this group 80 per cent of their average monthly income, up to a total of £2,500 per month.Providing support for directors of limited companies is trickier, the Treasury has consistently said. People in some industries who are in effect sole traders decide instead to set up as a limited company for a number of reasons, one of which is that the tax rate on idends is lower than on income.The Treasury argues that its support schemes are designed to replace income, not idends which come out of company profits. But groups supporting the self-employed and small businesses counter that this is unfair on people who have chosen to set up in this way.Workers must not be abandoned as furlough winds down, warns union boss“There are over 710,000 freelancers who work through limited companies, most of whom are now burning through their savings to get by,” said Andy Chamberlain, policy director of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed.“This group in particular is a startling and glaring omission from the government support. There are also hundreds of thousands of people who became self-employed just last year, who, in the early stages of their freelance career, are likely to be in a particularly precarious financial position. The government has left these groups completely out in the cold.”He pointed out that over a million fewer people than expected claimed the SEISS grant and urged the government to reallocate unused funds to help struggling freelancers.According to campaign group ForgottenPAYE, many more people are ineligible for support than the Treasury Committee’s report estimates. ForgottenPAYE is calling for grants of £14,000 for new starters and the newly self-employed to cover living costs between March and September.“Hardworking taxpayers have already gone homeless, been pushed into debt and poverty, and been forced to turn to food banks in a bid to survive,” said a spokesperson for the campaign group.“The mental health impact on those who have had their pleas for help ignored for over 13 weeks has resulted in a drastic increase in depression and anxiety, with many verging on suicide.“This is a huge step in the fight for justice for the 1.7 millions freelancers and 3 million-plus taxpayers who have been left with zero income and zero financial support from the government for over 13 weeks during an economic crisis.”   A Treasury spokesperson said: “The swift and targeted action we’ve taken has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods and our interventions have been rightly welcomed by the select committee.“Our wide-ranging support package is one of the most comprehensive in the world – with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than £6.5bn injected into the welfare safety net.“All our support is targeted to make sure we use public funds responsibly, helping those who need it most as quickly as possible, while minimising fraud risk.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Universal credit and jobseeker’s allowance claims jumped 23.3 per cent between April and May to 2.8 million, the latest official figures show. The claimant count has now soared 125.9 per cent, or 1.6 million, since March when the UK entered lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus.Average real wages fell for the first time in more than two years and job vacancies plunged 60 per cent in just two months, Office for National Statistics data revealed on Tuesday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe number of people temporarily out of work, including furloughed workers, rose by six million at the end of March into April, leading to a large fall in total hours worked.The total number of weekly hours worked in the three months dropped by 94.2 million (8.9 per cent) in the three months to April – the sharpest annual fall on record.‘Millions of jobs at risk’ as UK economy shrinks by a fifthThe disastrous employment figures come days after official data showed the UK economy shrunk by a fifth in the first month of lockdown.According to early estimates, the number of paid employees dropped by 2.1 per cent or 612,000 in May compared with March as employers laid off staff and stopped hiring.Average pay growth slowed “notably” in April 2020, the ONS said, and the three months to April saw total pay fall 0.4 per cent, the first inflation-adjusted annual fall since January 2018.Month-to-month, average pay fell by 0.8 per cent between April and May, following a fall of 2.8 per cent between March and April.Vacancies also disappeared at a record pace. Experimental single-month estimates indicated the number of vacancies fell 60 per cent, from 818,000 to 476,000 between March and May 2020 as employers stopped hiring.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe official headline unemployment rate between February and April remains low at 3.9 per cent, up 0.1 per cent on last year.However, the figures lag behind the real situation in the economy which is likely to be significantly worse. The number of people in employment fell by 430,000 between March and April, and more timely HMRC data suggest that the number of employees continued to fall by 160,000 in May.This rise has not yet shown up in the unemployment figures because many of those recently out of work have not actively sought new employment due to the lockdown, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank.The Foundation said the latest data ”reinforces the likelihood that Britain is on course for the biggest jobs crisis for at least a quarter of the century”.Economists forecast that unemployment could hit 11 per cent by the end of the year as emergency government support schemes close.The Claimant Count, which includes universal credit and jobseeker’s allowance claims, jumped more from 1.6 million to 2.8 million between March and May. The ONS cautioned that it is not possible to say what proportion of these claimants are unemployed and which are in employment but are low-paid and so entitled to claim benefits.Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said: “The headline figures may not show it, but a lot has changed since April – with the Claimant Count rising to 2.8 million, the unemployment rate is likely to be much higher than 3.9 per cent now.“But with the lockdown being eased and the economy opening up, hiring should grow. The scale of the growth in unemployment through the rest of the year will depend on consumer confidence and how employers react to the winding down of the furlough scheme.”A big concern for businesses and the government is what happens when the job retention scheme (JRS), which is currently paying the wages of 9 million furloughed workers, winds down.The furlough scheme closed to new applicants last week and from 1 July, employers will have to contribute to workers’ wages as the scheme is tapered down by the end of October.“The true impact of the crisis on the labour market is likely to only be revealed once the JRS starts unwinding in the second half of the year,” said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. “Many businesses are expected to bring only part of their furloughed workers back, while they seek to tentatively reopen after the lockdown. Hiring new workers is also likely to be put on hold for some time.“This means we could see the rate of unemployment average 11 per cent next year – and the last time it reached these levels was during the recession in the 1980s.”Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), called on the government to introduce a job guarantee to protect millions who may soon be out of work.“The labour market is on red alert,” Ms O’Grady said.“We need strong action now to stop lasting economic damage. The government must work closely with unions and business at national and industry level to get the next steps right. “The plan for recovery has to prioritise protecting and creating jobs. Getting people back into work is the only way out of recession. That’s why we need a job guarantee scheme to help those who lose work, especially young workers.” TUC analysis suggests that young people face a particularly pronounced spike in unemployment. Some 890,000 people aged under 25 work in either accommodation and food or arts, entertainment and recreation.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There is a lot going on in the labour market at the moment. In the two months to May, we saw a 600,000 fall in the number of people on the payroll. So, we are starting to see a worsening, worsening labour market.”Mims Davies, the minister for employment, said: “Today’s figures are starting to show the impact of Covid-19 on our economy, but our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts have protected thousands of businesses and millions of jobs, setting us up for recovery.“Already our nationwide network of work coaches have moved in to support jobseekers across sectors and match them with employers who are recruiting. By responding to the needs of communities across the UK they will be at the heart of our revival and renewal, helping people find new roles and move forward with their lives.”Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However I understand now, there is no excuse for reinforcing racist comments.Durnam added: “I plan to use my influence and social platforms positively, expressing in line with the peaceful protests that is it time for a permanent change.”In an emotional video on his Instagram Stories, Durnam told his followers: “I feel like now’s the perfect time to address what I’ve said in the past, a stupid comment I made when I was in a bad place. I wasn’t thinking straight. Everyone around me, my friends and family know it wasn’t me…“Staying silent is the worst thing you can do and I’m sorry from the bottom of my heart but the reason I never came out before and addressed it is because I’ve been scared the whole time.

ForgottenPAYE is calling for grants of £14,000 for new starters and the newly self-employed to cover living costs between March and September.“Hardworking taxpayers have already gone homeless, been pushed into debt and poverty, and been forced to turn to food banks in a bid to survive,” said a spokesperson for the campaign group.“The mental health impact on those who have had their pleas for help ignored for over 13 weeks has resulted in a drastic increase in depression and anxiety, with many verging on suicide.“This is a huge step in the fight for justice for the 1.7 millions freelancers and 3 million-plus taxpayers who have been left with zero income and zero financial support from the government for over 13 weeks during an economic crisis.”   A Treasury spokesperson said: “The swift and targeted action we’ve taken has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods and our interventions have been rightly welcomed by the select committee.“Our wide-ranging support package is one of the most comprehensive in the world – with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than £6.5bn injected into the welfare safety net.“All our support is targeted to make sure we use public funds responsibly, helping those who need it most as quickly as possible, while minimising fraud risk.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

More and more, they are moving to various platforms, including social networks, it found.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt noted that many people were finding their news through these social media sites in entirely different ways, with apps such as Instagram promoting new formats like stories and short videos. That has led people to look for more visual content rather than stories, the Reuters Institute suggested.Instagram is now used by 11 per cent of people across age groups for news. That is nearly as many as use Twitter already, and it is likely to overtake it overtake in 2021, the report indicated.Reading news on Instagram is changing the way young people thinkMany more people use Instagram generally than do Twitter, but relatively few of them use it to gain their news. The same is true of other, newer social networks, such as Snapchat.Outside of Instagram, most people still turn to Facebook for the majority of their news through social networks, with 36 per cent of people indicating they had used it to find stories. YouTube is second placed, at 21 per cent, with WhatsApp being used by 16 per cent of people to engage with the news.Many of those patterns have stayed true through the coronavirus crisis, it noted. Instagram and Snapchat have proven popular among young people, with many getting their news from celebrities on those platforms.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Please consider a contribution or subscription.“I was almost ripping my hair out waiting to get out,” says Linda. “I mean it’s not much fun when you’re on your own and no one to talk to because you can’t approach them.”Linda, who has a learning disability, lives alone in a one-bedroom flat. The 65-year-old is one of thousands of people in the UK who has, in her words, been “stuck to the house like glue” as she self-isolated during the pandemic.Normally she would have the opportunity to get out and about regularly, with help from staff at Mencap. But that has had to change.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We’d normally go with Linda and help her do her shopping, but now we’re literally doing it for her,” said Jon Andrews, one of her support workers. “It takes away her independence, but we have to weigh up the safest option.”A social activity group for people with learning disabilities has also had to be suspended, as have sessions at her local college.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“I was going to the Woking Adult Learning Centre twice a week,” said Linda. “I used to do history, dance, performing arts and pottery. I love it. I miss all that. I really do.”Linda’s experiences in lockdown is echoed by thousands of others across the country, according to Mencap, which claims people with learning disabilities are being forgotten during the pandemic, despite being one of the groups most affected by the crisis.The charity is concerned that lockdown has exacerbated existing challenges and inequalities after data from the Care Quality Commission has already shown a 134 per cent increase in deaths of people with learning disability in care settings, and NHS England statistics revealed that one in 50 Covid-19 deaths are of people with a learning disability.While the government has committed scaling up coronavirus testing to cover all care homes, over half of the social care budget goes to working age disabled adults who often receive support in their own homes or in supported living services.Mencap says this will mean many people with learning disabilities are not prioritised for testing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’ll be nice to see everyone, but they won’t be able to hug me – that’s the trouble.”She also said she was worried about whether she would be able to see her family at Christmas as she normally does.“I just want the virus dead and gone. I want my life back. It’s just not the same anymore.

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose. I do all kinds of areas of work but one of them is to make crowds of people.Created with Sketch.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Conservative and Labour MPs say they are dismayed the government plans to hold another public consultation on live exports – again delaying a decision on a ban after years of signalling support for one.One senior Tory is writing to the environment secretary demanding an explanation.The department of environment, food and rural affairs (Defra) says ministers are planning a fresh consultation, just two years after the last one.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe 2017 Conservative manifesto said it would be “possible to take early steps to control” the export of animals for slaughter, and last year’s manifesto promised to end “excessively long journeys for slaughter and fattening” after Brexit.Michael Gove, when he was environment secretary, in 2018 strongly signalled he wanted to end live exports, saying “all options” would be considered. He issued a call for evidence on curbing live exports for slaughter and improving animal welfare during transport.Created with Sketch.How they reach your plate: live animal transport worldwide Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A thirsty pig on transport truck is given water by Pigs being transported to slaughter in freezing weatherA volunteer gives water to thirsty pigs Pigs en route to an abattoirA cow looks out of transport truck just outside the slaughterhouse gatesStacked crates of rabbits awaiting slaughterA pig finds some air at a sale yardPigs in a transport lorry en route to an abattoirA pig in a transport truck touches noses with a manChickens in transport cratesA rabbit\u0027s nose and feet poke out from between plastic cratesA rabbit looks out between plastic crate slatsA chicken looks out through fencing on a crowded transport truckBroiler chickens are captured and loaded into transport crates for slaughterA ship carrying up to 30,000 sheep and cattle from Australia to Israel arrives at port after almost three weeks at sea A thirsty pig on transport truck is given water by Pigs being transported to slaughter in freezing weatherA volunteer gives water to thirsty pigs Pigs en route to an abattoirA cow looks out of transport truck just outside the slaughterhouse gatesStacked crates of rabbits awaiting slaughterA pig finds some air at a sale yardPigs in a transport lorry en route to an abattoirA pig in a transport truck touches noses with a manChickens in transport cratesA rabbit\u0027s nose and feet poke out from between plastic cratesA rabbit looks out between plastic crate slatsA chicken looks out through fencing on a crowded transport truckBroiler chickens are captured and loaded into transport crates for slaughterA ship carrying up to 30,000 sheep and cattle from Australia to Israel arrives at port after almost three weeks at sea The same year, as Boris Johnson campaigned to become Tory leader, he held out hope to animal lovers of a ban, condemning the trade as “barbaric”. But the government then asked advisers to make recommendations on improving conditions – and again no plans for a ban materialised.MP Sir David Amess, a member of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, told The Independent: “It sounds churlish but I’m fed up with the endless consultations, so I’m surprised we’re having another one.Activists fear Gove may backtrack on post-Brexit live exports banIf you’re a compassionate meat-eater, you should oppose live exportsSheep ‘cooked alive in harrowing conditions’ on live export ships“I’ve always listened to ministers on this, and always got the impression that we agreed that live exports of animals is not acceptable and we’re going to do something about it. So I don’t understand why we’re having yet another consultation.”He said he would be writing to George Eustice, the environment secretary, to ask why there would be another consultation and would raise questions in the Commons.The UK exports more than half a million animals abroad each year. The trade was worth £1.6bn in 2014-18.

Ministers should just get on and do it, while maintaining transport on the island of Ireland.“The government does not need another consultation to ban live animal exports. The number of animals exported is very small but there is political agreement on a ban.“We should not need another costly consultation for the same groups to say the same thing for ministers to act.”EU investigates ‘illegal’ 56-hour journey of two-week-old veal calvesDefra says its new proposed consultation is wider in scope than the last one as it would cover “excessively long journeys for slaughter and fattening”.In a new report on the export of EU animals by sea, the European Commission documents sub-standard vessels, inadequate checks on ships and poor legal accountability.It also identifies illegally high temperatures in lorries, and under-reporting of animals that are unfit to travel.Animals are regularly moved across the border between Northern Ireland and the republic in both directions, with many thousands sent from the north to Europe via the south. Last year, the republic exported nearly 300,000 live animals.Ministers of successive governments have argued that under the rules of the EU single market, which guarantee free movement of goods, it is not possible for any member state to ban live animal exports.Veteran Tory MP Sir Roger Gale, a patron of the foundation, said the government should ban live exports from 1 January, when the Brexit transition period ends, and set up a chain of local abattoirs to replace those that have closed over the years.“If a consultation is a way of kicking this into the long grass, it’s bad news but if it’s a way of producing a thorough response that would a good thing,” he said.A Defra spokesperson said: “The government has committed to improving the welfare of animals during transport and ending excessively long journeys for slaughter and fattening, and will be launching a public consultation in due course.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Universal credit and jobseeker’s allowance claims jumped 23.3 per cent between April and May to 2.8 million, the latest official figures show. The claimant count has now soared 125.9 per cent, or 1.6 million, since March when the UK entered lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus.Average real wages fell for the first time in more than two years and job vacancies plunged 60 per cent in just two months, Office for National Statistics data revealed on Tuesday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe number of people temporarily out of work, including furloughed workers, rose by six million at the end of March into April, leading to a large fall in total hours worked.The total number of weekly hours worked in the three months dropped by 94.2 million (8.9 per cent) in the three months to April – the sharpest annual fall on record.‘Millions of jobs at risk’ as UK economy shrinks by a fifthThe disastrous employment figures come days after official data showed the UK economy shrunk by a fifth in the first month of lockdown.According to early estimates, the number of paid employees dropped by 2.1 per cent or 612,000 in May compared with March as employers laid off staff and stopped hiring.Average pay growth slowed “notably” in April 2020, the ONS said, and the three months to April saw total pay fall 0.4 per cent, the first inflation-adjusted annual fall since January 2018.Month-to-month, average pay fell by 0.8 per cent between April and May, following a fall of 2.8 per cent between March and April.Vacancies also disappeared at a record pace. Experimental single-month estimates indicated the number of vacancies fell 60 per cent, from 818,000 to 476,000 between March and May 2020 as employers stopped hiring.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe official headline unemployment rate between February and April remains low at 3.9 per cent, up 0.1 per cent on last year.However, the figures lag behind the real situation in the economy which is likely to be significantly worse. The number of people in employment fell by 430,000 between March and April, and more timely HMRC data suggest that the number of employees continued to fall by 160,000 in May.This rise has not yet shown up in the unemployment figures because many of those recently out of work have not actively sought new employment due to the lockdown, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank.The Foundation said the latest data ”reinforces the likelihood that Britain is on course for the biggest jobs crisis for at least a quarter of the century”.Economists forecast that unemployment could hit 11 per cent by the end of the year as emergency government support schemes close.The Claimant Count, which includes universal credit and jobseeker’s allowance claims, jumped more from 1.6 million to 2.8 million between March and May. The ONS cautioned that it is not possible to say what proportion of these claimants are unemployed and which are in employment but are low-paid and so entitled to claim benefits.Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said: “The headline figures may not show it, but a lot has changed since April – with the Claimant Count rising to 2.8 million, the unemployment rate is likely to be much higher than 3.9 per cent now.“But with the lockdown being eased and the economy opening up, hiring should grow. The scale of the growth in unemployment through the rest of the year will depend on consumer confidence and how employers react to the winding down of the furlough scheme.”A big concern for businesses and the government is what happens when the job retention scheme (JRS), which is currently paying the wages of 9 million furloughed workers, winds down.The furlough scheme closed to new applicants last week and from 1 July, employers will have to contribute to workers’ wages as the scheme is tapered down by the end of October.“The true impact of the crisis on the labour market is likely to only be revealed once the JRS starts unwinding in the second half of the year,” said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. “Many businesses are expected to bring only part of their furloughed workers back, while they seek to tentatively reopen after the lockdown. Hiring new workers is also likely to be put on hold for some time.“This means we could see the rate of unemployment average 11 per cent next year – and the last time it reached these levels was during the recession in the 1980s.”Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), called on the government to introduce a job guarantee to protect millions who may soon be out of work.“The labour market is on red alert,” Ms O’Grady said.“We need strong action now to stop lasting economic damage. The government must work closely with unions and business at national and industry level to get the next steps right. “The plan for recovery has to prioritise protecting and creating jobs. Getting people back into work is the only way out of recession. That’s why we need a job guarantee scheme to help those who lose work, especially young workers.” TUC analysis suggests that young people face a particularly pronounced spike in unemployment. Some 890,000 people aged under 25 work in either accommodation and food or arts, entertainment and recreation.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There is a lot going on in the labour market at the moment. In the two months to May, we saw a 600,000 fall in the number of people on the payroll. So, we are starting to see a worsening, worsening labour market.”Mims Davies, the minister for employment, said: “Today’s figures are starting to show the impact of Covid-19 on our economy, but our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts have protected thousands of businesses and millions of jobs, setting us up for recovery.“Already our nationwide network of work coaches have moved in to support jobseekers across sectors and match them with employers who are recruiting. By responding to the needs of communities across the UK they will be at the heart of our revival and renewal, helping people find new roles and move forward with their lives.”Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I rang them to ask why it hadnt grown, but I was told this was normal.It got to six months and there was a little bit of growth but not much and after a year it still hadnt grown. I was left with scars and bald patches.Luke from Bradford said he asked for a refund but claimed his complaint fell on deaf ears.He claims the clinic offered him another operation at half the price.They eventually offered Luke a £ refund, barely a third of what he paid for the botched job.Luke said he thought he had found a bargain deal, but has now urged other men to fully research procedures and clinics.He added: I had always been really self-conscious about my hair and I hated it being wet or getting blown in the wind.Id always spend extra time styling it before going out, trying to hide my bald spot.It was affecting my confidence and my self-esteem and it was something Id been wanting to do for a few years.A hair transplant is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body to a bald or balding part of the body.This is usually from the back or side of the head to the front of the head.They would typically occur under local anesthesia.Pattern baldness is responsible for the majority of hair loss cases and this is usually genetic.Other factors can also contribute including:I looked into it and a lot of the places offering the treatment in the UK charged around £,, but they were offering it for £,.”He said the clinic had great reviews on Trust Pilot, leading him to believe he was getting “good value for money”.What I didnt know then was that anyone can post a review and companies can ask for reviews to be taken down, so I feel like I wasnt getting a full picture.After the operation Luke posted a review on YouTube.He was then contacted by the Hair Dr clinic in West Yorkshire who offered to fix the botched surgery.On March  he went under the kne and has now said the treatment he got in the UK was “world’s apart” from what he received in Turkey.In Turkey, the surgeons didnt even speak English so I had to communicate through a translator.Theyve done a great job and Ive already noticed signs of growth in my hairline.Id just encourage anyone to properly research the clinic and operations first.Dr Arshad, the lead surgeon at the Hair Dr transplant clinic, who carried out the repair procedure on Luke said Luke’s case had “really struck a chord” with him when he saw his video on YouTube.“I see so many clients in this unfortunate position on an almost weekly basis.Many people can look abroad for cosmetic procedures as many clinics often offer a cheaper rate.One expert told The Sun that more often than not, many people are ing with complications.Dr Knut Moe, Medical Director at Sons said clinics abroad can seem attractive due to a bargain price.Patients can get drawn in by free consultations and sales pitches with offers of free flights, accommodation and knockdown rates for hair transplants.

And it couldnt come at a greater time of need: with our nation on the brink of the worst ever holiday hunger.The Covid pandemic has had a devastating financial impact on families up and down the country, with millions now struggling to keep a roof over their heads.Parents are, understandably, racked with anxiety over job losses, loved ones health and school closures, which have seen classrooms lie empty for  weeks.And this week, with the summer holidays looming, they faced another worry: how would they feed their children without free school meal vouchers Its a fear Rashford has bravely alleviated.The Man Utd star made an impassioned plea to the Government to prioritise Englands most vulnerable kids by extending the vouchers scheme over the six-week holidays.Under the programme, the families of around . million children eligible for free school meals are given £ a week in vouchers to spend in supermarkets to keep their kids fed.This is not about politics this is about humanity, Rashford wrote in an open letter. Political affiliations aside, can we not all agree that no child should be going to bed hungry The footballer was speaking from real experience: growing up in a low-income household in Manchester, his own family relied on free school meals and breakfast clubs.Today, a similar hand-to-mouth existence is being lived by millions of children across the country. And, in recent months, its been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak.Despite the Governments excellent furlough scheme, , Brits have lost their jobs during lockdown, with unemployment now set to hit the three million mark.As Rashford rightly observes, many families are living on a knes edge, gripped with fear over how they will pay their bills, cover their rent or even put food on the table.This is proven by new data from The Food Foundation, showing that food insecurity in households with children has nearly DOUBLED since the pandemic began.The research also reveals more than , youngsters have been forced to skip meals during lockdown because their family couldn’t access sufficient food.As Chair of the Commons Education Committee, I was delighted when, earlier this year, the Government extended its free school meals scheme for the Easter and May half-term holidays.Yet, like many, I believed its decision to halt the programme for the summer break was wrong.In my view, this was for three key reasons:Firstly, the vouchers have been a leline for many poverty-stricken families during the Covid lockdown. With further worrying and uncertain weeks ahead, these families need consistency.Secondly, and closely linked, is that millions of parents are struggling financially at the moment - something that may be exacerbated in August, when furlough contributions change.Feeding their kids over the summer will push their already stretched budgets to breaking point. Yet these youngsters desperately need, and deserve, nutritional meals.Thirdly, around three million children are at risk of holiday hunger every year .Extending the scheme was simply the right thing to do.It was also relatively easy: yes, its coming out of a £ million Covid Summer Food Fund, but unlike other schemes, it isnt bureaucratic and its understood by parents across England.It also goes to those who need it the most.Studies have shown that food poverty doesnt just impact on childrens health: malnourished kids are less likely to perform as well in the classroom as their better-off peers.This can shape the course of their adult le.England is already facing an educational Ice Ageschools cant open in September - by which point, children will have been out of education for six months.Despite parents home-schooling efforts,  per cent of teachers in the countrys most deprived areas have suggested their students are learning for less than one hour a day.And some , youngsters don’t have access to a computer or tablet at all.Its why Ive called for Alan Turing catch-up summer camps to be set up in school buildings, village halls and marquees - anywhere that can be used to educate our kids.Its also why, despite being a Tory MP, I publicly announced I would vote with Labour today and call on the Government to extend free school meals over the summer.To use a football analogy, it felt strange going to play for the opposite side. But like Rashford, I knew that impoverished families across the UK deserved more.Fortunately, Boris has seen sense, too.Amid this crisis, we need a bold vision from the PM about our childrens education: what are we going to do to get them learning again  How will we get them back to schools We need an exciting, confident agenda, because the next generation depends on it. With todays move, Boris has shown these families that, yes, we do mean business.As for Rashford, he has done as much -not more - for disadvantaged families than any politician. Hes brought a vital issue onto the national stage in a dignied way.Unlike virtue-signalling celebrities who fly on a plane from Los Angeles then go on about saving the environment, he has practised what he preaches.And in doing so, hes shown himself to be a nation icon on and off the pitch.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This will unite aid with diplomacy and bring them together in our international effort.It makes no sense to ask whether this amounts to aid or foreign policy -  they are one and the same endeavour and are designed to attain the same goals which are right in themselves and serve the same goals.The PM also vowed the revamp will be used to make sure British companies get a “fair crack of the whip” when competing for aid contracts.It follows a review into UK aid spending by crossbench peer Lord Bew.The Bew review assessed the UKs £ billion aid budget as part of a review of how the UK interacts with the world.Boris said that the merger is an opportunity for the UK to have even greater impact and influence on the world stage as Britain prepares to hold the G presidency and host COP next year.The Department for International Development will now join with the FCO, with both sharing ministers since the February reshuffle.Anne-Marie Trevelyan will remain International Development Secretary for the next few months - but its not clear whether she will have a job after that.There are no plans for a second Secretary of State or a Deputy Foreign Secretary.Tory MP Shailesh Vara labelled it a good decision. He added: Ministers in both departments already have joint responsibility and it makes sense to have unied strategic planning.And Michael Fabricant MP tweeted: Im glad Boris has shown the agility and flexibility to Merge the Foreign Office and International Development Department into a Super-Department which integrates international policy  reflects our role as a Global Britain.James Roberts, political director of the TaxPayers Alliance, said:This sht is good news for taxpayers, but its crucial that the end result is less of their money being wasted.“Taxpayers must get the maximum possible value for every pound spent. For too long, cash has been thrown away by DfID on ineffective and unjustied projects - money must now go to those most in need, at home and abroad.But the decision was immediately attacked by former PM David Cameron, who said it was a mistake.He tweeted: The end of DIFD will mean less expertise, less voice for development at the top table and ultimately less respect for the UK overseas.Tony Blair and Gordon Brown also blasted the merger. Labours Sir Keir Starmer hit out at the decision, labelling DfID as one of the best performing and important departments.He added: Labour created DfID, and I am proud of that.Abolishing DfID abolishes Britain’s place in the world.The PM should stop these distractions and get on with tackling the health and economic crisis we currently face.The SNPs Ian Blackford said the PM was using the merger as an excuse to wind down aid for those who needed it most.International NGO Health Poverty Action hit out at the merger. Director Martin Drewry said: Absorbing DfID into the Foreign Office adds insult to injury for the world’s poorest people. It will increase inequality further by using aid, and therefore the lives of people around the world, as a bargaining chip for serving corporate and political interests.”The merger is understood to be backed by both permanent secretaries in the departments, and all staff meeting is understood to have been called in the Foreign Office for Wednesday.Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat welcomed the merger “ it maintains technical expertise that DfID demonstrates around the world.He said “I’ve long been calling for proper integration of the UK’s foreign policy to achieve the strategic outcomes, not just for ourselves but also our friends and partners.Britains foreign aid budget has faced constant scrutiny, with the PM under pressure last year after it emerged China and India received £million in UK cash - a rise of  per cent.The British taxpayer donated £, to a Chinese project to encourage shoppers not to buy products made with pangolins, an endangered species whose scales are used in traditional medicines, while its meat is a high-end delicacy.Meanwhile £, of aid was spent on looking at how solar  could power India’s railways.Andrew Mitchell, a former international development secretary, said giving taxpayers’ cash to China had brought the spending into “disrepute”.He said: “Spending hardearned taxpayers’ money in China, a country powering out of poverty and attaining superpower status brings Britain’s brilliant development work into disrepute.But the former DfID boss branded the merger a “quite extraordinary mistake” that will “destroy a key aspect of Global Britain”.Figures show that the UK provided £ in every £ of foreign aid handed out by  major countries in £.Having a department specically for “international development” might sound virtuous, but it makes no sense.The Foreign Office, which is in charge of building relationships with foreign countries, is perfectly placed to spend our aid money where it counts.If it had been in charge all along, our whopping aid budget would most likely have been used to fund valuable projects in fast-developing African countries — natural allies for Britain post Brexit.Thanks to the rudderless Department for International Development, it’s been squandered on things like upgrading roads in India — an enormously rich country with a fleet of new warships and a space programme to boot.The Sun is all for helping the genuinely needy. But given this country is facing its worst recession in decades, now is hardly the moment to be sinking taxpayer cash into overseas vanity projects with no possible benefit for Brits.If Boris is determined to stick to David Cameron’s pledge to splash . per cent of GDP on foreign aid, then let’s thank our lucky stars it will now be spent wisely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I want to show solidarity and speak out, but I equally understand that this is a time for Black voices to be heard, and for everybody  to listen for a change.As a photo colouriser I thought a contribution I could make would be to try and highlight moments of black British history in a way that might open a few eyes to the contributions of black people in this country over the past century.The snapshots include an iconic image of the ex-troopship Empire Windrush, which carried thousands of black Caribbeans to Britain to rebuild its shattered economy after the Second World War. Immigrants donned their best suits when they arrived as they entered the Southampton Customs Hall before heading to Victoria, Waterloo or Paddington.In , thousands of people from the Caribbean who arrived in the UK as children were threatened with deportation in what became known as the Windrush scandal. The Windrush generation, who arrived on British shores between  and  from Caribbean countries, were told they were here illegally despite having lived and worked in the country for decades.Many lacked the correct documentation to prove their right to remain in the UK and at least  black Britons were wrongfully deported to Jamaica in .The Home Office had a hostile environment policy of detaining and deporting Caribbean migrants who had a right to live in Britain.Former PM Theresa May headed up the Home Office at the time the policy was brought in and the then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd was forced to resign when the scandal was revealed in .A review of the Windrush scandal concluded the Home Office was institutionally racist but the allegations were removed in later drafts of the report which was officially released in March this year.

Either way,the PM needs a hand, here’s a brief glimpse into le as a black man in the UK. Warning – you may find some of this uncomfortable... To be black in this country is to be seen as a threat first and a person later. Being black is having to tell your children, as my father warned me, that they will need to work twice as hard and shout twice as loudly to be as valued as much as their white counterparts.  Being black is reminding your teenage kids that they will have to prove their commitment to learning so that they don’t fit into some teachers’ preconceived stereotypes. Being black is having to Google a country before you go there on holiday, just to check that it isn’t racist. Being black is being told, at least once in your le, “You don’t sound black” by a white person you meet in person after speaking over the phone. Being black is having to activate your kind, smiley nature to activelyset white people at ease on your initial meeting. Being black is wearing a suit to the airport because you are fed up of being stopped at customs in jeans and trainers. Being black is having to tell people not to touch your hair or head out of fascination. Being black is accepting that you will be stopped at least once by police - regardless of your profession – and asked: “Is this your car ”. Being black is that experience of taxis not stopping for you at night in central London – with the ones that do, asking for the fare up front. Being black is having to explain to people the history behind the ‘N’ word and why it’s use is unacceptable. Being black is having people tell you that they aren’t racist because they listen to Bob Marley.

In a humiliating U-turn, Downing Street announced a £ million fund which will benefit some . million children in England over the six-week summer period. Boris Johnson  dramatically caved in today to demands from campaigners and the -year-old footballer. As Labour hailed another U-turn, the jubilant sports star tweeted: I don’t even know what to say. Just look at what we can do when we come together, THIS is England in . The  Manchester United  star captured hearts with  a moving letter describing his own upbringing by a single mum  - and urging to PM not to let kids go hungry. Reversing the decision, Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed Mr Rashfordaposs contribution to the debate around poverty. What has changed    The government has now reversed its decision not to fund free school meals during the summer holidays. Ministers argued that the government does not normally pay for meals during school holidays but had already caved and covered the cost during the Easter break. Critics argued that the pandemic meant that ministers should make an exception to help families struggling to survive. The vouchers have been used since mid-March while schools were closed during the  coronavirus  lockdown. The £-a-week vouchers are available to use in local supermarkets by parents whose children who usually have received a free school lunch. Labour and other oppositions parties, charities and other campaigners had been calling for the government to continue the scheme through the long break. Footballer Marcus Rashford - who has raised more than £m during the crisis to feed hungry kids - turned up the heat with a heartfelt open letter to MPs. Pressure had mounted as the government refused to heed his demands. The government had instead promised a £m pot of money for councils. But the fund the PM offered wouldnapost guarantee a daily meal for every poor child. But now the government has U-turned and poured an extra £m, on top of the £m pot, into a one-off Covid summer food fund.How many children are eligible  Around . million children are eligible for the free meal vouchers, which are provided to most parents receiving  Universal Credit, income support, income-based employment and support allowance, income-based job seekers allowance or child tax credit. In England, about . million children  claimed for free school meals  in , or about % of state-educated pupils. In Manchester, where Marcus Rashford grew up, the figure is .% The take-up was greatest in parts of London, the north of England and the Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were receiving free school meals. How will the scheme work   The fund will essentially extend the current system of supermarket vouchers, which are given to parents of poor children who canapost attend school due to the virus, for six weeks over the summer break. Itaposs thought parents will be offered a one-off voucher to cover all six weeks of the summer holiday, worth £ per week per child. The vouchers will then come firmly to an end in September, when the government hopes all school pupils will be back in the classroom.  All those who currently qualy for free school meals due to their household income will qualy - the same criteria as for the current voucher system.

Ben Bradley, who made controversial remarks calling for unemployed people to have vasectomies in a blogpost written before he became an MP, has asked the government to put in measures to ensure the money is spent on food. The government reversed a decision on extending the free school meals voucher scheme into the summer holidays after a high profile campaign from opposition MPs, charities and England and Mancheser United striker Marcus Rashford. It is understood payment will be through a one-off, six-week voucher given to eligible families at the end of term to use in supermarkets, similarly to the current scheme. Mr Bradley told the Education Secretary: I have one concern that I hope you will alleviate, many of the most vulnerable children donapost live in happy, healthy households and we often find that those children - the ones that schools normally look out for - might be in a position where parents arenapost necessarily going to use those vouchers in the right way and the current system has no safeguards on that so it seems. Mr Bradley, who represents Mansfield, said in the House of Commons: My constituency has one of the highest levels of abuse, one of the highest levels of addiction in the country.Can we add before the summer a mechanism to make sure that those vouchers are used for healthy meals for vulnerable children  The Secretary of State replied: I can assure my honorable friend that there are mechanisms in place to ensure that the vouchers are not used for things such as alcohol, cigarettes and gambling and thataposs an important protection.  He added: One of the greatest strengths of a Free School Meal system about making sure children get a free school in the school is about making sure itaposs a healthy meal and itaposs there to support the child. Mr Bradley was forced to apologise two years ago when comments he made in a blog post were unearthed that said Britain would be drowning in a vast sea of unemployed wasters unless those out of work limited the number of children they produce. He made the comments aged  in a January   post on his blog consbradders. The now-deleted post was headlined “Give us the benefits ‘cap’ - before we all drown!”. he Mansfield MP said: It’s horrendous that there are families out there that can make vastly more than the average wage,just because they have  kids. Sorry but how many children you have is a choiceyou can’t afford them, stop having them! Vasectomies are free. Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford helped raise the profile of the campaign which forced the government to provide the vouchers. In a U-turn, Downing Street announced a £ million fund which will benefit some . million children in England over the six-week summer period, Number Ten said. After the news was announced, Rashford wrote on Twitter : Just look at what we can do when we come together, THIS is England in . Shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said: This is a welcome U-turn from the Government and a victory for the . million children who were at risk of going hungry this summer.  It is thanks to the amazing work of Marcus Rashford and campaigners that the Government has had no choice but to reverse their decision. The Government must now confirm that this new money will be for the direct provision of free school meals to all eligible children. The change of policy followed a plea by the Manchester United and England star to help children.

Sally-Ann Hart said MPs must not shy away from the issue that some parents just do not or cannot prioritise their childrenaposs needs over their own. And she said the Government must turbocharge its efforts to understand why such neglect happens. Ms Hart said examining the root cause behind this is better than throwing money at the problem, and outlined her support for a small state which protects inidual freedoms and allows people to take responsibility for themselves and families. She also argued a big state is much more callous as it engenders dependency, insisting the Government cannot take over a parentaposs job. Her remarks came during a Labour-led debate on the availability of free school meals during the summer holidays. Ms Hart opened by detailing how her Hastings and Rye constituency is blighted by poverty and deprivation, adding she wants to support the most vulnerable in the community and level up the area. She told the Commons: I am unashamedly committed to the Conservative ideas of a small state, inidual responsibility and upholding the value in the institution of family. Yet at a time of economic and health crises, I see that the most deprived are being punished disproportionately with worse health outcomes, suffering more from the closure of schools and being dependent on institutions like our food banks and charities.Ms Hart said there is clearly a role for state intervention in these unprecedented times of coronavirus, adding the argument on the availability of free school meals over the summer was not new.She also told MPs: To assume though that people who are less well-off will not or cannot feed their children is Iaposm sure somewhat insulting to disadvantaged families. In fact, during the coronavirus, many families have not accessed the free school meals or voucher scheme. Ms Hart went on: Ashighlighted, we must not shy away from the fact that unfortunately some parents just do not or cannot prioritise their childrenaposs needs over their own. We must turbocharge our efforts to look at the underlying causes of why some children are being neglected by their parents, rather than just let the Government step in, doing the easiest thing, throwing money at the problem, rather than sorting out the root cause - which is something we must do.Ms Hart reiterated her support for a small state, adding: A big state is much more callous as it engenders dependency and therefore ultimately lacks accountability to the electorate. I do believe we cannot let the state take over a parentaposs job, a parentaposs most basic responsibility to feed and keep their children safe. It cannot be right that government usurps the domain of the family and the most basic role of parenting. We cannot excuse people from the basic responsibility to their children. It is fundamental to being a good parent. We cannot have a culture which encourages the Government to take over the most basic roles of parenting. And we cannot have a culture where parents expect the Government to feed their children so that they can have money for other things. We cannot take away a parentaposs opportunity to take responsibility for themselves and their family. Ms Hart defended the Governmentaposs record on helping the most vulnerable in society. Conservative MP Ben Bradley earlier said he supported helping vulnerable children, before outlining a concern to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.

Here, she explains how...A couple of weeks after lockdown started, I found myself on the other side of London in a housing estate I didn’t know, trying to find a young woman I had never met before. She was a refugee, pregnant, alone and living in temporary accommodation. It was pouring with rain and I was standing in a stairwell as, in broken English, she was trying to explain over the phone how I could find her. When I finally got to her doorstep, I couldn’t even smile at her because I was wearing a face mask. And social distancing rules meant I couldn’t go in to sit down, have a cup of tea and explain the things in the box I was bringing her, as I would do normally. But as she stood in her doorway, I could tell she was really excited.  Hours later, we received a text message. It said how happy and delighted she was with the things we had brought her – that now she finally felt ready to have her baby, which she hadn’t before. It was such a moving moment.We normally have a core group of  volunteers, but since coronavirus it has just been me and my daughter Rosa, , running everything. So we decided to concentrate on baby boxes for newborns. They contain a sling, a steriliser and a breast pump as well as baby clothes, nappies, wet wipes, nappy cream and hygiene stuff for the mother. We’ve even started putting in a couple of loo rolls. It has been a struggle, but we have been helped enormously by National Lottery funding. And because lockdown has made it dficult to accept donations, where necessary we have also been able to afford a few bits to put in the boxes. The grant from The National Lottery has been a leline for us, allowing us to keep giving out our boxes which, in turn, the mothers say are their leline. Meanwhile, in Kent, another National Lottery-funded project, Youth Sports Trust, is tackling a problem facing young people - fitness and staying connected with friends... Sport is keeping kids connected  Teacher Guy Wilkins works closely with children’s charity Youth Sport Trust to enable children and young people to access competitive sport, training opportunities and learning leadership skills - and lockdown hasnapost put a stop to that. The -year-old, from Kentaposs Marjorie McClure School, said: During lockdown we’ve been running online meetings, setting physical challenges and sharing ideas for PE at home - such as ‘washing line tennis’ - to bring people even closer together. Many of us also got involved with the charity . challenge. For example, one of our students, James,  – who is a massive Crystal Palace fan – did  keepy-uppies.” Jamesaposs mum Wendy said the charity has been a vital link to the outside world for her son - and he has loved embracing the challenges. She told us: James has really benefited from having regular Zoom calls from school with his form tutor and Guy, as well as Tom who runs the after school cricket club which James attends.  James loves to have a look at these ideas and try out as many as he can. They suggested that the pupils try the daily Joe Wicks sessions as a fitness challenge and heaposs ended up doing them most days. The school challenged the pupils to take part in the . challenge so James ran walked .km and made a donation to the Bromley Mencap charity. Guy’s school – which is one of a network of six YST inclusive schools across South London – receives up to £, of National Lottery funding each year. This money helps to pay for leadership opportunities, give young people training to increase self esteem, confidence and communication skills, and the opportunity to experience badminton, volleyball, wheelchair basketball and athletics at inclusive sports festivals.They will also be taking part in YST’s National School Sport Week at Home, taking place from  to  June.

In sweltering heat, Vinnie passed out and was eventually found after a neighbour heard shopping bags rustling in the boot.

Gemma, who called the police, said on Tuesday: “We thought he went upstairs to play with his sister - they always play together. “I asked Ryan to go and get Vinnie and he said he wasn’t there. “I ran outside in hysterics screaming for him.

Coco the Monkey has been the mascot of the popular cereal since , although a monkey was used to represent what was then Cocoa Krispies in the US in the s. But the choice of a monkey as the cerealaposs mascot has been criticised by former Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya. Ms Onasanya, who was jailed for three months in January  after she was convicted of lying to police about a speeding ticket, asked Kelloggaposs why they chose a monkey for the chocolate-flavoured cereal, but aposthree white boysapos for Rice Krispies. She said she emailed the company for an explanation but was still awaiting a response. Ms Onasanya then tweeted: @KelloggsUK, as you are yet to reply to my email - Coco Pops and Rice Krispies have the same compòsition ... so I was wondering why Rice Krispies have three white boys representing the brand and Coco Pops have a monkey  She then followed that tweet with: Well, given John Harvey Kellogg co-founded the Race Betterment Foundation , it would be remiss of me not to ask.... It sparked a debate on social media, before former marine Ben Mcbean said people were getting side-tracked over culture war debates. Appearing on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, he said: I’m trying to fight real racist human beings who are going to cause me and my family harm and change my son’s future … and you’ve got people fighting to get the monkey taken off Coco Pops cereal for God’s sake. “The reality is we’re fighting too many battles that aren’t really there.” A Kelloggaposs spokesperson said: Itaposs important that we are all talking more about how we can build racial equality. Kellogg stands in support of the black community.  We do not tolerate discrimination and believe that people of all races, genders, backgrounds, sexual orientation, religions, capabilities and beliefs should be treated with the utmost dignity and respect. The monkey mascot that appears on both white and milk chocolate Coco Pops, was created in the s to highlight the playful personality of the brand.  As part of our ambition to bring fun to the breakfast table, we have a range of characters that we show on our cereal boxes, including tigers, giraffes, crocodiles, elves and a narwhal.

The Wild Planet Trust said it could no longer afford to reopen its Living Coasts site in Torquay, Devon, due to the huge cost of the coronavirus lockdown. It means  jobs are likely to be lost, while staff at Paignton Zoo and Newquay Zoo - which are owned by the same trust - are also at risk. The Devon site was home to a range of animals, including South American fur seals, African penguins, macaroni penguins, sea ducks, pied avocet, redshanks, black-necked stilts, ruffs, and terns. In a statement the trust said it regretted having to make the decision to close, but the attraction was no longer viable. It wrote on the Trustaposs website: Falling visitor numbers and the forced closure of all its zoos due to COVID- has meant that it has had to look at its cost base and make efficiencies. After nearly twenty years of operation the site also needed substantial maintenance that the Trust is no longer in a position to afford. It now means animals will have to be moved - but it is not yet clear how long this will take.  The site is home to a penguin beach, a tropical mangrove swamp, and underwater viewing areas. The statement said: The next stage is to find homes for the animals. Living Coasts is part of a world-wide network of zoos and aquariums and we will be looking for homes for the animals within them once movement restrictions have been lted.  Most of the animals kept at Living Coasts are marine species that will need specialist facilities. Living Coast is confident that good new homes for the animals will be found, but at present it is unclear how long this process may take.Following the announcement, the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariumstold The Independent: “ This is a huge blow to the conservation community and another devastating impact of the  coronavirus.“BIAZA’s thoughts are with everyone at Living Coasts and the Wild Planet Trust at this challenging time,” it added.

I know I can do it, my brain is saying I can but my body is saying I can’t.” Lily is the women’s world champion of WCMX, which is similar to BMX and skateboarding with athletes scoring points by doing stunts and tricks.The -year-old is also the first woman in Europe to land a backflip in her chair and the second worldwide. When she was eight Lily was diagnosed with a rare muscular disorder - hereditary spastic paraplegia - which would get worse over time. At first Lily, from Tenby, Pembrokeshire, struggled to come to terms with having to use a wheelchair, but when she discovered WCMX, her chair went from confining her to being the very thing that set her free. “I didn’t want to use the chair at all,” she says. “I tried to hide it in the corner of my room and I didn’t want anything to do with it.  “I thought the chair was a negative thing and it was me giving up. I didn’t want people to look at me like I was disabled. “But then I thought, what’s the point in hiding it  I may as well get on with it and show people what I can do.” After some research, and persuading her parents to support her in the sport, they got Lily a custom-made chair. Lily took to WCMX like a natural within seven months she landed a backflip after intensive training.  She says: “I’d spend hours on the same ramp just trying to get it right. I fell a lot, forwards, backwards, sideways. But eventually I landed it and it was the best feeling ever.” But after a bad fall at the end of , Lily’s confidence was badly bruised. She leaned forward slightly too much and slammed face-down on the floor, blood spilling from where she had bitten right through her lip. “I don’t remember it, I passed out,” Lily says. “Now sometimes when going up to the top of the ramp I freeze and don’t know what to do.”  Her dad Mark is a paramedic who was luckily at the skate park and checked Lily over before she was taken to hospital. He says: “I was worried about Lily’s neck but thankfully she was okay. I don’t want people thinking they can just go and drop in for the first time on a ramp like that. You have to train an awful lot. “Nature dealt us a raw hand. We needed to focus our energy and enable her to be a great human being who can survive and prosper.” In a BBC documentary on Wednesday night, brave Lily faces her fears and tries to put her accident behind her. Proud dad Mark, who is just as passionate about the sport as his daughter, says: “The wheelchairs are designed really dferently, they’ve got shock absorbers on the back, they’ve got bright coloured frames and skateboard wheels on the front so it looks like a cool piece on kit.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper home delivery offer","story":"NewsGet The Mirror delivered free to your door for six weeksIts packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByAlison PhillipsDaily Mirror Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  APR News\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

A study of , adults revealed  per cent admit to keeping a closer eye on their neighboursapos movements since the pandemic struck. Peeking at those not observing lockdown rules and looking out for groups of youngsters hanging around are among the most common behaviours to keep a watchful eye on. Others have also kept tabs on neighbours who have hosted a barbecue when not permitted, had a nosy at what kind of deliveries they have been getting ortheyaposve had workmen in and out of their house. It also emerged nearly half of respondents considered themselves to be nosy, having always kept a beady eye on street activity. But  per cent admitted to picking up the habit since the start of lockdown. A spokesman from Swt Direct Blinds, which commissioned the research, said: Much of the nation has quickly adapted to being at home more than ever in their letime. Itaposs only natural at times that residents have looked out of the window to see who is speaking to who - and doing what. Unsurprisingly, many seem to like to make it a bit of a covert mission, taking cover behind their blinds and curtains to not be seen snooping by fellow residents. The survey also revealed one in five adults have been branded a aposcurtain twitcherapos by someone they lived with while gazing out of the window. And during lockdown, respondents estimated theyaposve spent upwards of  minutes a day gazing out the window checking on other peopleaposs movements. How someoneaposs parking, or who is parking in front of their home was another reason for people keeping an eye on whataposs happening outside their house. One in  also admitted to rationing their used alcohol bottles and cans in their recycling boxes so fellow nosy neighbours didnapost think they were drinking too much.  When it comes to tactical reconnaissance, nearly a third peer out of the same window each time, with six in  preferring to mix it up and switch windows to get a better view of the action. The nation was split when it came to hiding though - with half ballsy enough to be seen watching on, but the others preferring a covert approach. But aside from shting the curtains,  per cent thought the classic venetian blind was the best option for snooping on neighbours, according to the OnePoll findings. It also emerged stealing a look through blinds or curtains, opening a window to listen in on a conversation and cupping your ear to the wall to hear whataposs going on were seen as sure signs youaposre a nosy neighbour. Other indicators included having a look through someoneaposs letterbox or window when a neighbour isnapost home, peeping over the fence and sneaking a look at a parcel thataposs been delivered to yo u for someone next door. When out and about,  per cent even admitted they enjoy having a look through the front room window of others when walking bytheir blinds are open. But nearly half of those polled saw their alertness to events on their doorstep as a sense of duty from a neighbourhood watch sense - while nearly a quarter said they just do it out of plain nosiness. And following the end of lockdown,  per cent say theyaposll continue their curtain twitching ways.

Vigorous testing is now taking place across those who were in the quarantine facility at the same time, and those who may have had any, even the remotest chance of contact , Ardern said in a Facebook Live post.New Zealand had trumpeted its achievement last week of becoming one of the first countries in the world to eliminate COVID- andto pre-pandemic normality, lting all social and economic restrictions except border controls.

Tensions are high on the peninsula after the office - set up to encourage better relations between the neighbours - was ruined in a terric explosion. It has led to fears of military clashes in the heavily guarded Demilitarised Zonethat ides the neighbours, who are technically still at war, after the North said its troops were prepared to enter the area. South Korean troops are amassing after the attack on the inter-Korea liaison office in the border town of Kaesong this morning. The North fired its weapons in a rage after anti-Kim Jong-un leaflets were distributed by defectors branded human scum by the secretive state. South Koreaaposs deputy director of the national security office, Kim You-geun, said: The government expresses strong regret over North Koreaaposs unilateral detonation of the inter-Korean liaison office building. We sternly warn that we will strongly respond to itNorth Korea takes any action that further worsens the situation. And he told a briefing that the destruction of the office broke the expectations of all people who hope for the development of inter-Korean relations and lasting peace on the peninsula. He also branded the destruction of the facility, which has been in use since , as a betrayal.South Korean vice unication minister Suh Ho, who co-headed the liaison office, called the demolition unprecedented in inter-Korean relationsaposapos and a nonsensical act. It had been closed since January as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Surveillance video released by Seoulaposs Ministry of Defence showed a large explosion that appeared to bring down the four-storey structure.  The explosion was heard at just before .pm local time on Tuesday and it was followed by a plume of smoke. It came amid fears of military conflict along the Demilitarised Zoneafter the Kim regime threatened to take actionNorth Korean defectors went ahead with a campaign to send propaganda leaflets into the North. North Koreaaposs KCNA state news agency said the liaison office, which had been closed since January over fears of the novel coronavirus, was tragically ruined with a terric explosion.  It is a setback in efforts to foster co-operation between the North and South. The act of aggression also appears to be a further blow to US President Donald Trumpaposs hopes of persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and open up to the outside world. We are aware that North Korea destroyed the liaison office in Kaesong and remain in close coordination with our Republic of Korea allies, a senior US administration official told Reuters.

The football was great. But the referee  Awful!What’s the Spanish for: “You don’t know what you’re doing” For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We now need to find a new home and urgently.#Bob Smith, who runs the second hand record store Aberdeen Vinyl at Aberdeen Market said the Market Village Company’s fall into administration came as a “surprise” and he had “no idea” there were any issues.He said he is still digesting the situation and is considering the future for his business.Bob said: “It did come as a surprise in the sense that we had no idea they were in trouble.“We are thinking on our feet.  We’ve been around a long time and we will find another way to retail.“There were rumours about this last week but it is now all official.“There is a never good time for something like this to happen.”Aberdeen Market was constructed in the #s as a replacement for Archibald Simpson’s New Market, which was built in the early ’s.The original market ran from Market Street to East Green but was demolished because British Home Stores bought the site on Union Street and wanted to expand.The new market opened for the first time in November .The building was officially opened by Sir William McEwan Younger at the unveiling ceremony.Younger was a well-known Scottish brewer and political activist.The new market would struggle to retain the popularity of its predecessor with many of the stalls and shop units falling empty, and in  it was given a £, facelt.A state-of-the-art CCTV system and a new paint job in  for the Union Street entrance, which had been blighted by graffiti, was aimed at helping to help ensure the Aberdeen Market had a healthy future.German art duo Herakut painted a dramatic painting on the outside of the building as part of the first Nuart Festival in .In April , the city council backed a planning application to completely revamp the market.The new “lantern-shaped” building would house offices, retail space, cafes, a business lounge and car parking, as well as public realm space.Adrian Watson from Aberdeen Inspired wished the traders from Aberdeen Market all the best for their future plans.He said: #Whilst respecting there are ambitious plans in the offing for re-developing the site, this is clearly an unsettling development for the people and the businesses currently in the New Market, with many having dutully served their customers for a number of years.#We all understand there are particularly challenging times for retail and we naturally wish all those affected the very best.#Aberdeen Central MSP Kevin Stewart said it was “sad” that a major part of the city’s retail offering looked like it would not reopen.He said: #Aberdeen market has been a feature of the city centre for decades so it#s sad to see it placed into liquidation.“While we know plans were in place for the market#s redevelopment, it#s vital that the council now works to support the local traders affected.”George Street and harbour councillor Michael Hutchison said it was #worrying# that the retailers based at the market were facing a #perilous# few weeks and months.He said: #For generations Aberdeen Market has been helping new business start up in this city. It#s therefore worrying that we#re at a point where both the building and the entity face perilous futures.#The small independent businesses in this market are part of what make Aberdeen unique and the market plays almost as important a role in our culture as it does in our economy.#My first concerns are for the market traders who will now face uncertain futures but we also need to give thought to how we can maintain those opportunities for future start-ups.#North-east Conservative MSP Tom Mason said: #The lockdown has exposed how brittle Aberdeen#s high street can be, as businesses wait to reopen.#But there is cause for optimism as le begins to normal.#Business and bustle is going to come back soon and people will be looking for places to spend their time and money.#Union Street and new developments will be key to that resurgence.#According to their Companies House entry The Market Village Limited is based in Merseyside and it was established in .Administrator Cowgills declined to comment.Aberdeen Market is owned by property firm Patrizia but a spokeswoman said the company would not comment on the situation.It understood the move into administration will have any impact on their redevelopment plans for the site.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

This is achieved by installing a large cylindrical passageway in the centre of a cage, from which tarpaulin hangs and protects salmon from lice infestations when they swim to the surface to fill their swim-bladders.At Port na Cro, the tarpaulin hangs to a m depth and the feeders are placed at m.Gareth Siney, farm manager at Port na Cro, said: #At the moment, we use lots of dferent tools to tackle sea lice such as water pressure and using cleaner fish that naturally pick the sea lice off our salmon.

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly. The covering can be washed with other laundry, using your normal detergent.When wearing a face covering, take care to tuck away any loose ends.How do I stop my glasses from steaming up If you wear glasses, wearing a face mask at the same time can cause the lenses to steam up, making it dficult to see properly.But the common problem has an easy solution, thanks to advice from doctors in the medical journal Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.To prevent the issue, doctors advise washing your glasses with soapy water before putting the mask on, and rinsing them under warm water.Then, gently dry off the lenses with a clean towel or cloth before putting them back on.Washing the lenses with soapy water leaves behind a ldquothin surfactant film that reduces misting on the lenses, meaning they now shouldnrsquot steam up when a face mask is worn.Should face coverings be worn where The current government advice states that face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, which includes some shops and public transport.At the moment, people are not being told to wear them outdoors, while exercising, or in schools or offices.Several airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair, have introduced a requirement for passengers to wear face masks on board.However, the government believes that face masks should be reserved for people who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-priest-moving-rome-new-job","story":"A BORDERS priest has accepted a high-ranking job in Rome.Nick Welsh, , has been based in Galashiels for the past two years.But he will soon be flying out to Italy after being picked for the role of vice-rector at the Scots College, where aspiring Scottish priests receive their training.Father Nick, originally from Stirling, told the Border he had ldquomixed emotions when he heard the news.He said: ldquoIrsquom quite excited, but Irsquoll have a bit of a heavy heart when I leave ndash I was just getting used to the Borders.Since , Father Nick has been administrator of the Parish of Our Lady  St Andrew, which has churches in Galashiels, Melrose and Selkirk.He said: ldquoI was really warmly welcomed here.

could help keep the ongoing Covid- epidemic under control, according to experts.New research based on mathematical modelling suggests that, in the absence of a vaccine, the most effective way to maintain control of the disease would require a combination of factors involving changes to human behaviour.These would include keeping social distancing measures in place, such as remote working and limiting large gatherings, alongside other preventative actions such as contact tracing and self isolation.The team used social contact data on more than , iniduals from the BBC Pandemic database.They also modelled the reproductive number , which is the average number of people each inidual with the virus is likely to infect at a given moment, using dferent scenarios.To keep the Covid- epidemic declining, R needs to be less than one.Had no control measures been put in place, R would be ., meaning that one infected person would infect two or three more people on average.The researchers calculated that mass testing alone, with % of the population undergoing random testing each week, would lower R to just ., as many infections would either be missed or detected too late.Compared with no control measures, self-isolation of symptomatic cases alone would reduce transmission by around %, lowering R to ..But the model showed that combining self-isolation, household quarantine and tracing strategies , would potentially reduce transmission by %, bringing R down to ..However, the researchers note that their model is based on a series of assumptions, such as quick isolation and adherence to quarantine, which they said are plausible but optimistic.They also said that their model only includes specic settings such as home, school and work, and does not explicitly include imported infections, which may be detected at a dferent rate from local infections.Study author Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine, UK, said: ldquoOur findings reinforce the growing body of evidence which suggests that we canrsquot rely on one single public health measure to achieve epidemic control.ldquoSuccessful strategies will likely include intensive testing and contact tracing supplemented with moderate forms of physical distancing, such as limiting the size of social gatherings and remote working, which can both reduce transmission and the number of contacts that need to be traced.He added: ldquoThe huge scale of testing and contact tracing that is needed to reduce Covid- from spreading is resource intensive, and new app-based tracing,adopted widely alongside traditional contact tracing, could enhance the effectiveness of identying contacts, particularly those that would otherwise be missed.The research is published in the

October -.Keith Pelley, European Tour Chief Executive, said: ldquoSince the suspension of our  season in early March, we have taken a measured approach in reassessing our schedule, informed every step of the way by our medical advisers and government guidance.ldquoWe have consistently said that safety is our absolute priority and that is why today we are announcing our resumption in two monthsrsquo time supported by a comprehensive health strategy which has been led by our medical team.ldquoWithout question we have had to think dferently about the remainder of our  season which is reflected in todayrsquos announcement.ldquoAs golfrsquos global Tour, ersity is ordinarily one of our biggest strengths, but in this instance it has become one of our biggest challenges.ldquoInitially, therefore, based on the expert guidance we received, playing in clusters, in one territory, is the best option in terms of testing, travel and accommodation.It is the second year in a row that the competition has been played at the East Lothian course.Last yearrsquos event was won by Bernd Wiesberger after a play-off with Benjamin Hebert.Among those hoping to line up at the tournament is North Berwicks Grant Forrest.The -year-old, who finished tied for rd at least years event, said: \"It is great it is going ahead.\"Obviously, so much uncertainty in the last few months and the guys on the European Tour have been working really hard to put something together for us.\"I am glad they have got it on the schedule and I hope the weather is alright in October ndash who knows what it could be like \"There was a point where I thought it would almost be a year off, which would have been a real shame.\"They have done really well to give us so many events already and with the hope they could add a few more.\"Councillor John McMillan, East Lothian Councilrsquos spokesman for economic development and tourism, was pleased to hear the event had been rescheduled.He said: ldquoI very much look forward to welcoming world class golfers back to East Lothian for this fantastic tournament.\"We will of course work closely with the European Tour and in accordance with guidance on the detail of how the tournament can be run safely.\"It is an encouraging development and signals that Scotlandrsquos Golf Coast will be back open for business this year albeit with some restrictions still in place.Councillor Jeremy Findlay, who represents the North Berwick Coastal ward, was similarly pleased to see the event rescheduled but stressed it remained to be seen how the tournament would look in terms of a crowd.He said: \"I think it is great news not only for Scottish golf itself but for tourism in general.\"Hopefully, by then, we will be able to have crowds as well but I am really not sure what the rules on that are going to be yet ndash whether it is crowds or played behind closed doors, it would be a bit oddit was behind closed doors.\"In general, we will have to wait and see what the rules are about crowds.\"That is what produces the benefit in the short-term to the local economy.\"Mr Findlay highlighted that the tourism sector had taken \"a huge hit\" during the coronavirus

kayak, is part of the proposals revealed by the local authority with a series of images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining and agricultural heritage and the site of the Battle of Prestonpans.The council launched its eightweek consultation on its online hub on Monday.The Scottish Government is revising its National Development Planning Framework which gives an overview of what it wants to see develop on key sites across Scotland.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe are grateful for the many views and ideas received in response to early engagement on National Planning Framework  .Our analysis of the responses is underway and will continue over the summer, and we expect to publish an update in the autumn.The council consultation can be found at

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly.

Yoursquod scarcely know that there has been any lting of lockdown. One neighbour says her grandmother scoffs at the idea that the coronavirus crisis is like the last war, when she was a child in a nearby town. Although they were often hungry, they had complete freedom. Even when the air raid siren went, and they had to e into shelters, they did not feel the all-pervasive threat of today.Nor, unless they were extremely remote or unlucky, were people shut off from each other. We talk a lot about the power of modern technology to keep us connected, but in those times, whether you were in a village or a city, there was daily contact with other folk, evenyou lived alone. People wouldnrsquot have felt the need for video calls when they could nip out of theirdoor and visit whoever they liked nearby. The Blitz spirit is not entirely a myth, but the circumstances in which it thrived were very dferent from this pandemic.My mother lived in London and, in , like countless city children, was evacuated to the country. She was luckier than many, being sent not to strangers but to an aunt, who lived in Herefordshire, near the Welsh border. There was no running water, light was by paraffin lamp, her uncle was an irascible war veteran, and her aunt would often retreat to bed for days, finding the extra responsibility rather too much. But for an -year-old, collecting eggs from under hens, sauntering up the lane for still-warm jugs of milk from the farm, and seeing a night-time sky lit by stars was a revelation. From then on, she counted the days until she could leave London forever.Not all evacuees felt the same way. Encountering beetles and bugs for the first time was hard enough, but herds of cows with a bull among them must have been pretty alarming. One boy, who had never previously left the Gallowgate, ran to tell the farmer that ldquothey coos are eating arsquo your grass. Another Glaswegian, taken into a Perthshire home, escaped onto the roof when they ran him a bath. He thought they were trying to drown him.Recalling that period, my mother spoke of country folksrsquo shock at the poverty of inner city children, who had come from slums. Those who organised the mass evacuation were appalled to discover that, when asked to provide each child with a change of clothing, a toothbrush and enough food for a dayrsquos journey, a lot of families were unable to do so. It was a sobering eye-opener. Rural hardship was re, but it did not compare to the scale of urban deprivation: barefoot youngsters with rickets, scurvy, ringworm, or so underfed they were the colour of lard.Itrsquos hard to imagine what it must have felt like to be dropped into a world of fields and trees and pitch black nights, when you were used to well-lit canyons of concrete and stone or to find yourself alone in a bed, when usually therersquod be siblings on all sides, keeping you warm, and your parents only a step away. Some children were so miserable, they had to be sent home. For others, like my mother, it sparked a lelong love of the countryside.Not that she idealised her auntrsquos way of le. Some aspects of it were, for a Londoner, like stepping back in time. Nor, in the s, was there any glamorising of country le. It was often equated with backward attitudes and ignorance. If anything, most villagers dreamed of escaping to the city, or at least the suburbs, and a clean, warm house with all mod-cons.Irsquove been reading Dirk Bogardersquos memoir, Great Meadow, in which he recalls his childhood in the Sussex Downs, from the age of six. Between  and , he spent weekends and long spells of holiday in what his affluent parents called a cottage, but photos show as a substantial house. Later he was packed off to Glasgow, which he loathed, but thatrsquos another story. In Great Meadow, he and his little sister were looked after by a nanny, while his actress mother swanned around in a kimono, and his father raced up and down to London where he was on The Timesrsquos picture desk. Bogarde often mentions the healthiness of the country, compared to London, where public transport was frowned on, because of the risk of germs. This was a legacy, perhaps, of the Spanish flu.Bogarde loved everything about the cottage, but the most noteworthy feature was the outside lavatory. Every Friday he had to dig a hole in the garden and, under cover of dusk, empty the privy bucket into it. His great fear was of tripping, because sanitation was basic. Theyrsquod have a weekly bath, filled by their nanny, but his parents preferred going to the nearest pub for their ablutions.Years ago I visited friends in rural Perthshire who had an outside toilet. I rather liked it: it was made of wood, and smelled of sawdust. Unlike the shed at the bottom of many cottage gardens, one wall was open, so the view was lovely, even in the snow. You didnrsquot have to crunch over snails in the dark to reach it ndash bedrooms came with chamberpots ndash and as a guest there was no fear of ever being asked to empty it. To watch him on screen, yoursquod never think Bogarde was the man to cope with such a noisome task. If for any reason it suddenly becomes a necessary chore in our cottage, Irsquoll be with the Gallowgate evacuees, heading straight back to the flushing loos of the Merchant City.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The Government is rudderless, drting making contradictory decisions or no decisions at all.Boris Johnson had nothing sensible to say about the Black Lives Matter demos which drove a coach and horses through the lockdown. He could either have endorsed the protests as legitimate on moral grounds, or called on the police to enforce the law. He did neither until forced to. Leadership was lacking.The belated introduction of a -day quarantine for travellers to Britain seems like a self-destructive exercise in closing the door after the viral horse has bolted. His Government is cancelling border checks on the , lorries that enter the UK every day, while also saying that the Brexit transition period will not be extended.:Nicola Sturgeon: Boris Johnson putting political interests ahead of the public interestJohnson is accused of allowing children in England to go to theme parks but not to schools, leading to further problems for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The two-metre rule is causing massive problems as the economy tanks, yet the medical evidence for its effectiveness is contradictory.But the most serious accusation made last week against Boris Johnson was that he was asleep at the wheel in early March, and that his dilatory behaviour led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.The claim was made by the former SAGE member, Professor Neil Ferguson .ldquoHad we introduced lockdown a week earlier, the Imperial College epidemiologist told MPs last week, ldquowersquod have reduced the final death toll by at least half.In other words,the UK Government had closed the schools and shops on March  instead of March , the official death toll might have been , instead of ,. This retrospectively validates Fergusonrsquos own forecast back in March that, on his model, lockdown should have kept the death toll to around ,.I think most now accept that the UK did just about everything wrong in its response to Covid-. We didnrsquot close the borders, didnrsquot protect care homes, abandoned testing and locked down too late. The question is: who is to blame for all this The editor of The Lancet, Richard Horton, in ldquoThe Covid Catastrophe which is to be published this week, names the guilty man: Boris Johnson. He failed to attend crucial meetings of COBRA, the Cabinet crisis committee, failed to listen to scientists, and thought the country should ldquotake it on the chin in order to protect the economy.But it was not just the PM who delayed lockdown by one week. This was also the policy of the Scottish Government.I happened to be in the Scottish parliament on March , the day that Leo Varadkar announced the closure of schools and universities in Ireland. At First Ministerrsquos Questions, Nicola Sturgeon explained why she was not following suit. She was, she insisted, ldquofollowing the science.School children sent home were likely to take the disease into their communities and to older people, ldquowhich might be a greater risk in terms of spread of infection than their being in school. She also said that parents would have to stay at home to look after them and this would denude staff for essential services like the NHS.:London Protests: More than  arrested as Boris Johnson condemns far-right protests as lsquoracist thuggeryrsquoIt all seemed sensible at the time. The national clinical director, Jason Leitch, was all over the media saying that the vast majority of us were going to get the virus anyway, because there was no vaccine, and that we had to ldquoprotect the vulnerable as it ldquoworked its way through the population.The release of SAGE minutes two weeks ago confirms that the scientic advisers were at best cool about lockdown. They may not have been in thrall to heartless herd immunity, but they did believe that trying to suppress the virus would be counterproductive.On March , the minutes say \"SAGE was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress the spread of Covid- will cause a second peak.It added that it was ldquoa near certainty that countries such as China, where heavy suppression is under way, will experience a second peak once measures are relaxed.The scientic consensus was that eradication of the disease was not possible because it would spread until herd immunity ndash % of the population ndash finally burned the virus out. But Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, took a dferent view. She closed the borders immediately cases appeared and kept them closed, and imposed a severe lockdown internally and suppressed the virus until it disappeared. Last week she declared victory over Covid .\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Coronavirus in numbers: UK death toll at ,\",\"description\": \"Coronavirus in numbers: UK death toll at ,\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media gHqFBAP poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests gHqFBAP.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Only time will tell whether SAGE was right. There may indeed be a second wave and New Zealand will have very little immunity to it. Borders cannot be kept closed forever. However, the minutes seem to confirm that, as Professor Lawrence Freedman argued in the New Statesman, ldquothe Government was largely following SAGErsquos advice.Some have claimed that Nicola Sturgeon wanted to follow dferent advice and was overruled by Westminster. That isnrsquot the case. The First Minister was following the same scientic advice as Westminster, and made clear she did not believe lockdown was yet necessary or desirable on March .Itrsquos hard to believe that a weekrsquos delay could have led to , deaths, as many as on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Scientists will debate this for years.Indeed, analysts in Bristol, led by the mathematical modeller Professor Simon Wood, now claim now that the disease peaked before lockdown was introduced, suggesting that SAGE was right.SAGE had always argued, as the minutes show, that the best way to contain the spread was hand washing, social distancing, and protecting the old and vulnerable. The UK Government was only persuaded of lockdown by Neil Fergusonrsquos infamous forecast, on March , that without it , would die.The one thing we have learned from coronavirus is that science is not a monolith and that scientists disagree as much as politicians. All of which makes little dference to the state of the PMrsquos popularity, which dropped dramatically during Cummingsgate and has not recovered.Tory commentators are whispering that Johnson has lost it, doesnrsquot look well.

What a shame, then, about the second thing I couldnrsquot help noticing: how drab and disappointing George Square remains.Granted, the grim sight of loyalist protesters wrapped in Union flags ldquoprotecting the statues and Cenotaph didnrsquot help. But even without their isive presence the cityrsquos historic square is a let-down, visually, socially and culturally, a frustrating waste of urban space that could and should be far better utilised.Where other European squares create buzz and atmosphere with year-round arts, culture, food and shopping attracting locals and visitors, George Square is dreary and uninspiring: a few trees, some benches and a clutch of dull, predictable th-century statues ndash ldquogreat men and Queen Victoria ndash that few feel any kinship with. The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow. Granted, such an ambitious revamp wouldnrsquot be easy to fund in the dficult years ahead, but with a crucial economic and culturalat stake, it should be prioritised. Surely a mixture of public, private and philanthropic funding could be sourced Glasgow City Council has already started the conversation that could make all this happen, by bringing forward the pedestrianisation of George Square and suspending a third of city centre parking bays to make room for walkers and cyclists.I would urge council leader Susan Aitken and her team to think bigger. A commitment to redesign George Square would offer an exciting, positive and inclusive focus for Glaswegians in the tough months ahead. The end result could be what Glasgow has been crying out for for a generation: a proud and modern civic centrepiece that is worthy of our great city, a place that excites, entertains, and educates, that makes us feel part of something bigger.

Unsurprisingly, as time passes so businesses from across the region are increasingly seeking clarity on a wide range of issues vital to their survival.With Phase  of the unlocking process due shortly, the FSB believes that this is the perfect time for smaller businesses to question Mr Ewing on what the Scottish Government is doing to support businesses over the next year.The FSB’s Highlands  Islands Area Leader and director of the Kylesku Hotel, Tanja Lister, said: “We know how anxious businesses are becoming about their abilities to survive in this new world and, given that the virus is unpredictable, they clearly want as much clarity as possible so that they can plan their survival strategies once unlocking takes place.“In particular, they want to know when and how unlocking will take place, what they must do to comply with distancing protocols, how local communities will be persuaded that the time is right to unlock, and the nature of the Government-backed business support that will be put in place to carry the regional economy though to next Easter and beyond.“Nobody should think that businesses can go from nought to  in a few days – it will take a long time for them to recover, and many will need ongoing support from governments, public agencies, other businesses and, very importantly, the general public, for many months to come.“We know how heavily engaged Mr Ewing is in his vital role and we are delighted that he is giving up his time to take questions on Monday. This is the perfect time for him to meet Highlands  Islands businesses and we are looking forward to a very productive hour with him.”Questions must be submitted in advance and we will ask as many as we can in the allotted time, say the organisers.

Not wearing a face covering may mean passengers will not be able to travel.Due to social distancing requirements, the numbers of passengers within the terminal building will be limited and only travelling passengers will be allowed in the terminal. Special assistance support is still available for those who require it.All passengers will be welcomed by a member of the HIAL team on arrival who will help guide them through the new procedures.Based on the latest advice from the Scottish Government and Health Protection Scotland temperature checks are not currently required.Managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “My colleagues have worked extremely hard to offer a safer environment for passengers at our airports and we will continue to rely on the understanding and cooperation of travellers to follow our new procedures to make their experience as smooth as possible, given the current restrictions.“We are pleased that we are now able to focus on a safe and gradual resumption of air travel, however it is vital that everyone plays their part in helping ensure we avoid risking transmission of COVID-, by ensuring that you turn up at the airport wearing your face mask, maintaining social distancing and personal hygiene. We will continue to move in lockstep with Transport Scotland and adhere to Health Protection Scotland advice.“We do not know , or when, we will be able to travel as we did pre-coronavirus and given that all of us must adapt to these new habits and procedures in order to go about this part of our lives.“As we implement our procedures, we are doing our utmost to get everything right for our passengers. I would ask anyone who has any concerns or comments, to please let us know in the first instance so we can address them and contact a member of the team at your airport.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It has allowed the waste crews to collect recyclables that have been stored in folks’ houses, whilst ensuring that our crews are able to work within the requirements of physical distancing. To ensure we have cleared the backlog, we intend to continue with the four-week cycle again.”Green recycling bins and boxes should be put out on your usual bin day – but remember to do this weekly. You should remove the caddies inside # and the items for collection should be included in your single green bin or box as we will be unable to pick up more than one at a time.Grey bincollections for household waste will continue on a fortnightly basis – again on your usual collection day.This means that the council will collect:• Glass # week commencing June .• Plastic # bottles week commencing June .• Metals and tins # week commencing July .• Paper card # week commencing July .Councillor Drever added: “We want to thank households for their cooperation and patience whilst we continue to clear the backlog of recyclables that folk have been storing during the pandemic.”Just a reminder that paper and card is being collected this week . This should be contained in a single green bin or box.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Orwe the providers are the birds, desperately hoping for an income, fat and seed to feed us after an extra-long winter.Social media fluttered with posts from businesses stating ‘we hope to be open’, the sensible ones being aware of Fergus Ewing’s proviso: “This date cannot be definitive and is conditional on public health advice and progression to phase three of the route map.”While a lot of work will need to be done, practicalities and protocols worked out, how do we clean rooms, how do we ‘meet and greet’, do we leave rooms fallow for  hours, do we use PPE when cleaning, I think as much work needs to be done in the wider community.How are the visitors going to eat, how are they going to shop I have seen some quite lax adherence to protection in local shops with face covering usage fairly minimal at best.We have probably got away with this behaviour due to the low numbers of cases outwith the care home community.This could change with an influx of people from away. Any vigilantism must be directed at ourselves and the messages we put out when we go about our day to day business as lockdown eases.Protect ourselves and others.Those vulnerable people we have been looking after with prescription runs and message collections, some of them might not be looking forward to an influx of staycationers.What  are they bringing with their much-needed cash None of these problems are insurmountable. Guidelines will be available and in the month ahead, confidence will hopefullyand a dose of common sense will go a long way to making things work.The talk is that furlough is just the precursor to redundancy, and the economy will be struggling in all sectors.The knock on is likely to be fewer visitors with less money, and of course with the quarantine enforcement for overseas visitors, there won’t be many coming from afar.I hope the tourismwill be a trickle, then a stream, in order for us all to get used to how it can work.Despite being involved in the business I actually hope that it never s to the flood, the tsunami of the last two years, where the danger was the destruction of our environment and our community.We were perhaps too busy making money to spend time with our families, friends and neighbours.While loving the quiet roads, the time spent with family, and the time spent re-evaluating prioritiesit couldn’t last for ever.The savings are being eaten into, the government assistance also doesn’t last forever, reality looms.There is an economic model of price and product determination, that everybody is acutely aware of called “supply and demand’.In recent years as the visitor numbers went through the roof, and perhaps became unsustainable, bed provision rose, spare rooms developed, cabins and pods built, garages renovated.Still numbers rose, and so did the prices, a simple correlation.There is likely to now be an oversupply of bed provision, the economists would foresee a reduction in price as people compete for a smaller market.This may at first bring prices down to a realistic level, there was perhaps a danger that Skye was becoming a rich person’s destination.A possible consequence may be what I have heard described as “a race to the bottom”, with what is effectively a price war, and possibly falling too far.This when the product suddenly has become more expensive to manage, rooms costing more to clean, hotels only being able to cope with fewer guests to comply with social distancing.We have a free market economy, there is little or no control, people can charge what they like, and undercutting is a valid entrepreneurial technique do something better cheaper#!I mentioned weeks ago, for many, the tourist dollar is the icing on the pension cake, a second income to a professional wage.Perhaps there is a fine line between need and greed.Some tourist operators have been forced to use food banks and needing help from the Skye Community Response group during lockdown.As business s, and these people can begin rebuilding their livelihoods, perhaps others have to decide what their own needs are.The pension or the wage might be enough.One of the reasons I love starlings is the incredible murmurations they create in autumn, just before roosting in the evenings.These bickering birds who flutter and jostle around the trees, for twenty minutes or so before descending to reeds and branch to sleep, put on a display with no equal in nature.Moving in unison, they create patterns in the sky, shapes, forms, dance. Apparently, each bird affects the six or seven around it but a flock of tens of thousands moves asone, producing something beautul.Community can be like that.The West Highland Free Press online shop

The film follows a group of four young misfits as they set out to find the treasure of a long-lost pirate on their last weekend living in their under-threat neighbourhood.A noisy, high-energy and light-hearted watch, it was the perfect feelgood film for a sunny Sunday evening amid the current doom and gloom of the world.Among the spectators were die-hard fans of the movie, Nicky Kells and Michelle Currie. and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"Nicky Kellsand Michelle Currie from Ballynure FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNicky Kellsand Michelle Currie from BallynureThe couple, who travelled from Ballynure for the occasion, say they were glad of the excuse to leave the house and have some sense of normality for the evening.We love The Goonies, it#s one of my favourite movies. To see it on a big screen will be great, said Nicky . It#s really strange that we haven#t been able to get to the cinema in so long. So, it is nice to just get out to do something dferent is a novelty now.Waiting patiently for the film to get under way, the Co Antrim pair praised the smooth running of the event, which was organised by local firms Red Box Media Productions and MayWe, a Belfast-based event management company.Cars were positioned two metres apart in line with social distancing guidelines and the field was lined with portable toilets for convenience, each one monitored by stewards and cleaned after every use.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseReporter Jenna Gardiner FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappReporter Jenna GardinerEven as soon as we pulled in we were impressed, it#s been very well organised, Nicky said. I couldn#t believe how clean the toilets were, especially for an outdoor event.The view is cracker with the screen positioned just in front of the Harland  Wolff cranes, added Michelle . The setting is just lovely.The couple say they are keen toto the drive-in cinema should it continue when the rest of normal le resumes.Compared with those distant memories of my pre-Covid cinema trips, watching from the car was a convenient experience.While drive-in cinemas are a relatively new attraction to Northern Ireland, borne out of the pandemic, I was struck by how nostalgic an experience it was to join hundreds of others to spectate from the car.Perhaps that#s down to the fact I#ve only ever seen it done in Grease, or due to the now-dated special effects of the film, but the whole ritual certainly felt like a blast from the past.One new novelty of the experience was the lack of distractions, with no coughing or sneezing, people using their phones or pesky whispers to contend with.Accessed by radio, we controlled the sound and volume ourselves and could recline our seats as far as we liked.Another plus for the spectators is that by attending the screening they were also helping in the fight against coronavirus, with all profits going towards vital research at Queen#s University Belfast.Without any indication of adate for conventional cinemas in Northern Ireland, the drive-in event offers a new prospect for movie buffs across the country.Around , cars attended throughout the day for four dferent classic movies, including The Lion King, Frozen  and Back To The Future, with an additional three films shown on Saturday.Certainly a fun way to spend an afternoon, the event kicked off with an interactive quiz to test our knowledge of The Goonies before the film started. Afterwards, it ended with a round of applause - or rather, a honking of horns - as the credits rolled on the Steven Spielberg classic.

The updated shielding guidance applies until June  and Dr McBride has said further guidance will be provided before the end of the month.Officials are facing calls to provide clarity to people who are shielding, particularly amid reports that some people are coming under pressure toto work, while concerns have also been raised by younger people who are shielding about the effects the protection measures are having on their children.DUP MLA Alex Easton, a member of the Stormont health committee, said any further letters advising people to shield must include more information for patients and employers.I would like more clarity around shielding in general, he said. My father, who is diabetic and has lost both legs as a result, didn#t receive a letter, so I think that the letters need to include a lot more information.I would like to see the letters include a booklet with a list of conditions and medication that mean patients should shield. There should also be specic information for employers because I have been contacted by people who have been told to shield and they are being expected to work.I think the majority of employers have been very understanding, but the longer this goes on, the more challenging it is going to be for those who are shielding. The next letter should include detailed information for employers about why it is so important that anyone who is shielding should take the precautions that is being sent out by the CMO.People who have been deemed as falling to the highest clinical risk group, and have therefore been told to shield, include anyone who has had an organ transplant, cancer patients, people with motor neurone disease and anyone with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.In the letters being sent out to people this week, Dr McBride explained: I know that this has been a very challenging time for you and that it will not always have been easy to comply with the advice. The Covid- virus still poses a high risksomeone who is shielding is exposed to it. However, infection levels in the community are now falling so the risk of exposure is signicantly less than it has been over the last two months.Because the risk is lower, I have now updated the guidance for Northern Ireland so that from June  those who are shielding can now spend time outside with people from their own household or one person from another household whilst ensuring that social distancing is observed. I know that you will want to know about our plans for the future of the shielding advice. Please be assured that we are actively reviewing the shielding advice and we will provide new guidance before the end of the first shielding period.Dr McBride is also asking anyone who is shielding to take part in an engagement process which will help advise government policy on shielding in the months ahead.He added: Finally, I wanted to thank you for all of your efforts during this very dficult time. The Covid- pandemic has made huge demands on many people across Northern Ireland, and I want you to know that we understand the uncertainty and upheaval that those shielding, their families and carers in particular have faced.Belfast Most ReadCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingSecond wave of Covid- could be lethal, Northern Ireland projections suggest Land Registry overcharged users by nearly £m in Northern IrelandMany could die in new NI coronavirus surge warns expert, but former WHO chief says second wave unlikelyPolice hunt for two men after teenage girls sexually assaulted in Belfast park,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I am currently considering options to cover the July and August period and will be making a bid for funding of just over £m from the Executive’s Covid- fund to provide a summer food scheme for those children who normally receive free school meals Peter WeirPeter Weir, the Education Minister, had previously said his department did not have the money to extend the scheme, which has cost £m, outside term time.On Tuesday evening Mr Weir said: “I am fully aware of the concerns that some children will go hungry over the summer period, especially this year when direct payments in respect of free school meals are due to end on June .“I am currently considering options to cover the July and August period and will be making a bid for funding of just over £m from the Executive’s Covid- fund to provide a summer food scheme for those children who normally receive free school meals.“This will form part of a wider paper on summer activities to be considered by the Executive when they meet on Thursday. “This will include a proposal to extend the Education Authority’s ‘Eat Well Live Well’ programme which has been running for a number of months and is currently providing healthy breakfasts and lunches to over , vulnerable young people.”With Sinn Fein having also called for an extension, it is likely that additional financial support will be approved. Mr Murphy, the Finance Minister, posted on Twitter: “I’m determined to identy the money necessary for this. Hope to bring proposals to Executive in near future.”Doing well in education can be dependent on a range of dferent home and indeed personal factors, but we need to ensure that young people have the best possible opportunity to succeed to when theyto school hopefully in late August September Arlene FosterSpeaking during Assembly question time on Tuesday, Mrs Foster said: “I am very sympathetic to ensuring that our young people have the certainty of at least one good meal per day over the summer months.”“And we know that that is a challenge for many families. And I know this is an issue the Deputy First Ministeralso takes very seriously and indeed having spoken to the Education Minister he is also very supportive.”She added: “Doing well in education can be dependent on a range of dferent home and indeed personal factors, but we need to ensure that young people have the best possible opportunity to succeed to when theyto school hopefully in late August September.“There are exceptional circumstance due to Covid- therefore I will be proposing to the Executive that meals continue to be provided to that cohort of children over the summer period this year,the necessary finances can be secured.”Greens councillor for Lisburn and Castlereagh, Simon Lee, who is also a teacher, said the Executive has no option but to must follow the Government and help affected children here in Northern Ireland.“I’ve volunteered across the Castlereagh area during the course of the pandemic and it’s clear that many families are struggling from sudden changes in circumstances,” he said. “Covid- didn’t give rise to holiday hunger but job losses and income drops have exacerbated already dficult situations. This payment represented a leline for many families - one that will be lost in the coming weeks.”SDLP MP Claire Hanna insisted food banks across Northern Ireland will face increasing demandsadditional funds are not allocated to extend meal payments.UUP MLAs Mike Nesbitt and Robbie Butler on Tuesday tabled a motion for Stormont to introduce an equivalent scheme to the Government’s summer school fund.“Strikingly, Scotland, England and Wales have already said that they will continue with their support for those who receive school meals through the summer,” said Mr Nesbitt. “I would appeal to the Education Minister and the Executive to make sure that children in Northern Ireland do not miss out.”Sinn Fein MLA, Karen Mullan warned families are facing a “severe” financial “clf edge”the matter is not addressed by Stormont urgently.Belfast Most ReadCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingSecond wave of Covid- could be lethal, Northern Ireland projections suggest Belfast Thai restaurant to close as downturn in trade takes its tollLand Registry overcharged users by nearly £m in Northern IrelandMany could die in new NI coronavirus surge warns expert, but former WHO chief says second wave unlikely,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

My licence now will only last for a year and I will have to renew it at my own expense.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNigel Best  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNigel Best On his days off he also worked at Woodgate Aviation for the Air Ambulance on a voluntary basis.After six years as a pilot his last flight was on March , bringing passengers from Manchester into Belfast.I know everybody puts so much effort into their job, but everybody within Flybe, from the cabin crew and engineer to the pilots, worked so hard. It was also a very family-oriented business. Everybody knew each other and everybody was there for each other. People had worked there for  years or more and they loved serving the people of Northern Ireland, he says.Since lockdown, Nigel has been doing DIY projects using his engineering skills, and has been looking for work.I#ll probably go back to engineering, there#s more likelihood of me getting an engineer#s job in Northern Ireland, he adds.He says the highlight of his career was when he flew his family on a scheduled flight to London City Airport for his we#s grandmother#s th birthday, fulfilling her letime ambition of visiting the Cha Flower Show.He also loved sharing his knowledge as an engineer with first officers working alongside him in the cockpit.To me it was just the sheer fact that I never went to sleep at night dreading that I had to go to work the next morning.The worst aspect was always the threat of redundancy. Aviation is always the first industry that reacts quickly to a downturn and an upturn. Because of the cost in aviation you have to act very quickly and those who react the quickest are the ones who survive.It#s hard after  years to write up my CV, look at all the experience in my background and think where this leads to outside aviation.Nigel believes that Flybe employees lost their jobs as a result of Covid- because Virgin Atlantic, which had bought over the business, decided to focus on its own brand.Flybe was connecting people, families, businesses within the British Isles and that has now been lost, he adds.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePhilip Land with his late father Paul FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPhilip Land with his late father Paul‘I would cut my arm off to get a job in the industry again... it was an amazing experience but things will be dferent’Philip Land , from Lisburn, was a flight attendant for Flybe until the airline went into administration just before lockdown. He is married to Karl. Following a career in hospitality, Philip was working at a catering company in Belfast City Airport when he was encouraged to apply for a cabin crew position by crew stopping for lunch.“I’d always wanted to be a cabin crew, but because of my age and height, I didn’t think I would be suitable,” he says.“But I went to the assessment day and passed — that was three years ago and I was a cabin crew member from March that year. It’s been the most brilliant time.”Philip describes Flybe’s employees as being like a family. “My best day was the first day I flew on what is called ‘fam day’, short for familiarisation, when I had to fly home in the jump seat, the third seat in the cockpit, for the whole of the flight from Southampton to Belfast and that was absolutely amazing — it’s not something that you normally get to do, to see what the captain and the pilots do.“You get to see the take-off and the landing and you’re watching the ground coming closer and closer — it’s absolutely amazing.”Philip, a rep for Unite the Union, was on a health and safety course in Carlisle when he learned that Flybe had closed down.“I spent all night talking to members on the phone — they were like brothers and sisters and uncles and aunts. It had to be the worst day of my le, the loss of that job,” he says.“I never realised until it was coming to an end how much it takes over your le. I loved going to work.“The company went into administration on March  and the following week, the country started to go into lockdown. We were dealing with our members, trying to get them sorted, updating their CVs and making sure all monies were arranged. We had a two-week period of manic activity, trying to get people organised, and all of a sudden it was locked down and you couldn’t do it anymore.”After going into lockdown, Philip fell ill and was in self-isolation for nearly four weeks.“I had every symptom, other than the cough — a sore chest, my body was so sore, I couldn’t even get out of bed most days. I don’t know whether it was the mental exhaustion after two weeks of living on adrenaline rushes. Karl had a cough, but nothing untoward, but he wasn’t right — we both definitely weren’t right.“I’ve had many, many bad colds when I was flying — you pick up anything that is going around — but that had to be the worst. “Six of us that had been in the same group all had symptoms and we all feel we had some form of coronavirus, but you can’t get tested as you are just a number to this government.”After recovering, Philip has spent the time in lockdown painting and decorating and taken part in weekly Zoom quizzes with friends, but has barely left the house.“My father, Paul Land, was a Cha pensioner in London and he got Covid and died on April . My brother had to arrange a virtual cremation for him,” he says.“Things have been hard. I am a mental health first-aider, which has been a lesaver for me, because there are times when you just think... why ”Philip says that unless Flybe s or is replaced with a small regional airline, he can’t see himself being able to work in the airline industry again.“My concern is that there is so little connectivity now with the mainland from Belfast. We don’t have the bridge Boris Johnson is talking about, we don’t have a tunnel to get across. WI’d cut my arm off to get a job in the industry again. It was an amazing experience, but it’s going to take time for it to settle down and how are they going to work with self-distancing “If they’re doing a deep clean for each flight, that’s at least an hour. Things are going to be very dferent.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCaoimhe Leigh Harkin has been in lockdown in Dubai since March, having become an Emirates cabin crew employee last year FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCaoimhe Leigh Harkin has been in lockdown in Dubai since March, having become an Emirates cabin crew employee last year‘If it takes two years for things to go back to normal, my contract will be over...but I may go home to my family’Caoimhe Leigh Harkin , from Co Tyrone, has been a flight attendant with Emirates since last March and has been in lockdown in Dubai. She originally graduated in journalism in  before working as a travel journalist in Dublin, but was keen to travel before settling down. She was hired by Emirates in February last year after attending an open day.“Before all of this, the job has been wonderful. I have loved the travel and the whole experience,” she says.“I’ve been to Australia, Italy, South Africa, and I’ve done some amazing things. I’ve been to Bali, Mauritius — I’ve been to places I would probably never have been toI hadn’t taken the job. I thought, ‘If I don’t do this now, I’ll never do it’.“With Emirates, every day is so dferent. You have  days off a month in Dubai and you do seven or eight flights, some of which are layovers, or they could be turnaround flights, where you leave Dubai that day and come back that night.“It’s been the best year of my le — there’s literally no words to describe it. The hardest thing is jet lag and being sleep deprived — you just sleep when you can. But when you’re going into a layover for  hours when it’s somewhere you’ve never been before, you just have to go and see that place and do without the sleep.”Caoimhe lives in an Emirates-owned accommodation tower along with many other crew members.“We’ve made a wee family out here — me and my best friends live in the towers beside each other. Every day is dferent, there’s something always going on in Dubai.”At the start of the pandemic, the city was in -hour lockdown with tighter restrictions than in the UK, she says.“We needed a permit even to get groceries and you only got the permit once every three days. You had to input your UEA identication andyou went before your three days was up, you got declined.

They literally have drones going round the streets sterilising them —only everywhere could do it the way Dubai does it,” Caoimhe says.Her last flight was on March  and she has been in lockdown ever since, and found it hard to adjust to a less active lestyle.But with the relaxation in lockdown, she was able to book a hotel in the city and stay there for five nights with some friends.“It has a suite with a private pool and the views are amazing over the skyline of Dubai,” Caominhe says.“We have our own rooms, but we’re able to spend time together, which is nice. The hotel is only for residents of Dubai. We have to be in by pm and can’t leave the hotel until am, and we’re still sticking to the guidelines because we’re not in one room. The past five days have been really nice, but it’s back to reality tomorrow.”Caominhe says Emirates is bringing staff back in phases.“There’s a lot of negativity in the news about other airlines, but Emirates don’t have that at all... they’re making people stay on top of their safety procedures before we get started back.“We’re on standby and you have to be preparedyou’re called for a flight. If you’re called to do a flight, you have to quarantine for  days afterwards.”But she says she’s not sure what to do in the long term. Her contract lasts for three years and Caoimhe wasn’t intending to do a second contract afterwards.“If it takes two years for things to go back to normal, my contract will be over and I didn’t plan to stay longer. I’m trying to be smart about it, but my decision may be going back and spending time with my family — maybe it’s a sign,” she says.

It must remain below one to avoid exponential growth.The briefing paper states that modelling suggests that R remains signicantly below  at present. It is estimated at between . and ..The number of people in the community currently infected with Covid- is estimated at between  and ,. The large range is because of uncertainty about the percentage of patients who are asymptomatic.It warns over % of the population remain susceptible to Covid- and any subsequent waves could be signicantly worse.The briefing paper explores the potential scenariosthe #R# number starts to creep above , although it warns #R# is less reliable and useful at very low levels of infection.Its figures are not a prediction of what will happen. This will depend on public compliance with any restrictions, policy decisions and other factors such as the behaviour of the virus and the development of effective treatments or a vaccine.Health officials have used modelling to show what would happen#R# rose to ., . or . from June , and measures to suppress the epidemic were not taken or were ineffective. The modelling extends to the end of .It states:If #R# rose to ., the epidemic would peak in early October with close to  patients requiring ICU support in early October. Under this scenario, modelling suggests four-week restrictions may need to be put in place in mid-August, late October and then February .If #R# rose to ., the epidemic would peak in early December, with over  patients requiring ICU support.The paper notes that in either scenario deaths would be much greater than in wave one of the epidemic.If #R# rose to ., the epidemic would still be increasing at the end of  and over  patients would be in critical care.Mr Swann praised society#s herculean efforts to stem the virus, but warned complacency remains the biggest enemy in the continuing battle against Covid-.It is impossible to stress enough that this terrible disease, which has already claimed the lives of so many of our loved ones, has not gone away, he said.It remains ready to strike again, perhaps with even greater ferocity than before.We only have to look at the modelling, which was released recently by my department, to see that as we emerge from this phase of the pandemic, we most do so with caution and an appreciation that the war is far from won.Previous modelling at the outset of the pandemic predicted , deaths in what Mr Swann described as a nightmare, worst case scenario.

But with furloughed workers in such huge numbers, even, of the , didn’t have a job to go back to, a lot of lives will be blighted.In the space of a week, Bombardier and Thompson Aero announced , job losses earlier this month.While it’s already dficult to get our heads around the impact of Covid- on our jobs market so far, we must brace ourselves for worse to come.Belfast Most ReadCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingSecond wave of Covid- could be lethal, Northern Ireland projections suggest Belfast Thai restaurant to close as downturn in trade takes its tollLand Registry overcharged users by nearly £m in Northern IrelandMany could die in new NI coronavirus surge warns expert, but former WHO chief says second wave unlikely,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Data equivalence… is separate from these negotiations but it is important on the island of Ireland to continue to share information.”Alliance MP Stephen Farryasked: “Does the minister realise that in the event we fail to secure a deal with the European Union, and the Government opts to trade on its terms, then the impact of a border down the Irish Sea would be more severe with businesses facing more costs and households too ”Mr Gove replied: “It is the case that we will push to secure a deal and a deal would be in everyone’s interests.”Labour MP Rushanara Aliasked what steps the Government is taking to prevent panic buying in the event of a trade agreement with the EU not being in place at the end of the transition period.She added: “We’ve seen the spectre of panic buying and stockpiling at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.“What preparations has the minister made to prevent stockpiling and panic buying by worried consumers in the event of the disruption and chaos that a no-deal Brexit would cause to the supply chain ”Mr Gove replied: “It is the case thatwe leave without a specic free trade agreement that certain steps will need to be taken by Government and by others in order to make sure not only that we can meet the challenges but also that we can meet the opportunities and the Cabinet Office and others constantly review at all points what we need to do.“But I think the spectre that the honourable lady invokes is not one that should bother her or others.”PAMost ReadCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingSecond wave of Covid- could be lethal, Northern Ireland projections suggest Belfast Thai restaurant to close as downturn in trade takes its tollLand Registry overcharged users by nearly £m in Northern IrelandMany could die in new NI coronavirus surge warns expert, but former WHO chief says second wave unlikely,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At the beginning of this year the Derry News revealed that the Trust had implemented a three-year ‘financial recovery plan’ to address a poundm deficit. Finance Director Neil Guckian said the Western Trust was the only Trust in Northern Ireland with such measures in place. By February of this year the overall deficit had been reduced to around poundm. Of that total, poundm is a direct consequence of cuts over the past six years and the remaining ten is due to investment in additional staff because of safety concerns or service growth, and the extra cost of delivering existing services such as locums. googletag.cmd.push A poundm financial and efficiency recovery plan had been agreed for   which would leave around poundm to save in the final year,  . Cost saving areas identied included the recruitment of locum or temporary doctors which soared to poundm in  . Speaking at a media briefing on June , Western Trust Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen said that due to the pandemic the financial recovery plan has been ‘put to one side’. “The priority has been to respond to COVID and take whatever steps we needed to take, whether that involved staffing, PPE and other aspects of services. “So essentially we have paused our recovery programme because of the COVID pandemic. googletag.cmd.push “That doesn’t mean that we are less attentive to running the business, we run the business of our organisation as efficiently and effectively as we can. “But the actual detail of the recovery plan has been set to one side during this period.” The cost of running health services during the pandemic has risen dramatically with the rise in PPE usage and need for enhanced cleaning schedules in all health and social care settings. In April, Mr Guckian said the Trust would normally use , fluid resistant surgical masks per day. That increased to , a day at the beginning of the pandemic, then , and at the height of the pandemic to ,-, masks in a single week.

At a meeting of the Western Trust Board on June , Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen provided a snapshot of community services by reading out an email from a community team leader based at Great James Street. In it the worker said: “All the publicity has been about the efforts within the hospital, and quite rightly too, but the hospital didn’t get the expected the surge from COVID-. “However, the volume of work in both our services in the community has been huge and much more intense than usual. googletag.cmd.push “I know the health visiting team are exhausted, this rate of work can’t be maintained, and we’re not going to get any relief as our services are stepping up now again.” The worker explained that staff had pulled together as a team and embraced new ways of working, at one stage managing a % reduction in staff numbers. She said: “This crisis has expedited the process of our team getting smart phones and from the feedback it has made a huge dference in being able to interact with families, especially safeguarding families. In such a short space of time. “Parents are able to send video clips to health visitors, for example to diagnose oral thrush or see the walking gait of a child. googletag.cmd.push “We set up a parents health line and looking at other ways to improve contact with families, a dedicated Facebook page in conjunction with Trust communication’s team but controlled by the health visitor team. “Parents have been emailing parents the information they require. “Our health visiting team has been working extremely hard although home visiting was reduced. Health visitors were ringing families at home with each call lasting about  to  minutes longer than a home visit might have taken.” Health visitors were contacting more families with a total of , calls for home visits completed in April for the Derry, Limavady and Strabane areas. Dr Kilgallen continued reading the email: “They start making them before am and are working consistently throughout the day, one after another which is much more intense. “They also have the worry that many of the safeguarding families are not being seen, they are being tele-linked and that’s harder and very tiring. “We had health visitor redeployed into the hospital therefore leaving vacant caseloads but those on the ground are working to cover those vacant caseloads so there isn’t a backlog.” The team leader went on to speak about the community midwery services who experienced a high volume of work with an increase in the number of antenatal bookings. They anticipate that come November-December onwards there will be a signicant workload due to lockdown. The meeting was told that , people have received help and support from community based teams, including those iniduals who were shielding. That included delivering food parcels and prescriptions, and regular telephone contact. Dr Kilgallen said she brought this feedback to board members so that they can all recognise the ‘very dedicated work’ of this team.

At a Stormont sitting this afternoon questions were put to the First Minister including one from Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan about the Magee project. Arlene Foster said The Executive Officehas reaffirmed the commitment set out in the New Decade New Approach document to establish a graduate entry medical school in Derry. Its objective now is to progress the project to secure a ‘sustainable outcome on the fastest feasible timetable’. “This is a complex project involving a number of departments and external agencies,” the First Minister said, “and TEO is currently working with the departments of health, economy and finance to prepare further advice to the Executive on the issues which need to be addressed to secure that sustainability.” googletag.cmd.push On May  Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that TEO would assume responsibility for the medical school project and on May  that it had been approved. Mark H Durkan askeda ‘cast iron guarantee’ could be given that it will be ready to accept admissions in September  and,so, what specic dates and deadlines must be met. He was told the Executive received an update from the head of the civil service yesterday. The strategic investment board are involved to ensure that any ‘risks are minimised’ around the delivery of this project, she continued. The First Minister stated: “We do not intend to make any announcement about the date of first intake until all the necessary preparation work has been completed and we very much hope that will continue at pace in TEO. googletag.cmd.push “Because as I said this is a cross-departmental issue which is why TEO stepped in to try and assist to make sure that things move smoothly.” FINANCIAL CHALLENGES UUP leader Steve Aiken said one of the key strategic partners for Magee is Ulster University and UU has been involved in ‘very signicant cost over-runs’ at its Belfast campus. “I think there are some investigations ongoing as to whether UU are actually capable of managing projects. “Therefore, can I ask the minister what confidence she has that UU are actually a suitable partner for delivering this vital project for Londonderry.” Arlene Foster responded: “Capacity and finance are clearly issues that will have to be examined as a wider look at risk management in relation to this scheme and that’s why the head of the civil service was able to give us an update yesterday.” Independent East Derry MLA Claire Sugden said she understands there has been ‘considerable capital monies committed to the Magee project’. But she queried whether the department for the economy required additional finances to resource the running and day to day costs ‘or is that something they’ll have to find within their own budget’. DUP leader Mrs Foster said the ‘financial and governance challenges’ currently facing UU will be overseen by the strategic investment board. It’s important to have that body ‘looking in at what we’re trying to achieve’ she said, ‘to give us the confidence that any risks that are identied can be managed and mitigated.’ Those matters will be taken forward but with oversight from TEO. ‘ECONOMIC DAMAGE’ The Derry News has also learned of a letter circulated to UU staff this afternoon. Professor Paul Bartholomew, Interim Vice-Chancellor at Ulster University informed colleagues about the ‘financial sustainability’ of the institution. In the correspondence he cites a dferent Higher Education funding model in NI and the Coronavirus pandemic as major obstacles. He says ‘the immediate economic damage is now becoming clear’ and ‘we need to consider the implications for us within the context of our already stretched financial position.’ “In that context, and as you would expect, we continue to closely monitor the financial trends and outlook to build a sustainable financial strategy that must address not only the financial impacts of COVID, but also the pre-existing challenge of a cost base that has grown, whilst income from government block grant and fees from capped student numbers have remained largely flat.” He makes it clear that its financial strategy is likely to necessitate staff cuts. Prof Bartholomew said: “That sustainable financial strategy has identied a number of options that may, in the near future, be put forward for decision. Representing nearly % of our total cost base, those options necessarily include staff cost reduction measures. “A full strategic review is also proposed to enable clarity around strategic priorities and associated resource allocation we understand that across the institution staff are already operating at full stretch and any decision made to achieve sustainability must, in parallel, address issues of workload and prioritisation.” He adds: “With the full support of SLT and Council, we have been engaging with the Department for the Economy and our own Trade Union colleagues, to ensure there is a full understanding of the position, this has been in advance of considering formally any possible options that offer the best solutions for staff.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Foyle MP said:“The SDLP have been campaigning for Magee expansion for many years and we secured a ringfenced funding commitment as part of New Decade, New Approach.We also worked hard to secure a commitment to supporting Magee expansion in the draftProgrammefor Government in the south.The money was made available and in the months that followed, we urged the DUP and Sinn Fein to make thenecessary decisions and get this project delivered.” googletag.cmd.push “Not only did we find ourselves rebuked as negative when asking practical questions, we were told that it was a done deal. Clearly, it is not as the First Minister was unable to provide these basic assurances today in the Assembly Chamber, when questioned by my colleague Mark H Durkan MLA.” “We will continue to fight for the Medical School and a fully expanded Magee campus. We hope that it will still open next year, but this latest statement from the First Minister makes it more dficult. At very least, the people of Derry deserve transparency and honesty from those holding the most senior positions in the Executive. googletag.cmd.push SDLP Economy Spokesperson, Sinead McLaughlin MLA added:“This is a very disappointing lack of clarity and to be blunt, Im angry about it. We were promised the Magee Medical School was coming next year and now we are not sure. We have to invest in training more doctors to reduce locum costs and to strengthen our health service. Covid- demonstrated the need, but it looks likely that Derry and the North West will be let down by the DUP and Sinn Fein, once again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We hope that it will still open next year, but this latest statement from the First Minister makes it more dficult.

We were promised the Magee Medical School was coming next year and now we are not sure. We have to invest in training more doctors to reduce locum costs and to strengthen our health service.

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

When he came out of the changing room bearing a grey hoodie, with the rest of his team-mates in black and white, you wondered had he even got a jersey. But whatever he dreamt about on the night before, whatever he thought about over dinner, he wouldn’t have believed he would have scored an injury-time goal to win the trophy for his new club and win the man of the match award. googletag.cmd.push That’s exactly how it panned out. The sides level at - apiece, thirty seconds of injury-time played, and a long ball is spilled and flapped at by Ronan Tracey in the Foreglen goal. Poaching on the edge of the small square , as he did time and again in the green and gold jersey, it was a simple task for O’Kane to punch home the winning goal. Some ironies are just written in the stars. This one came in spite of every single ounce of effort Foreglen had to give. Kevin O’Connor was O’Kane’s partner in crime since the two were knee high. They tormented defences in Intermediate football for years. They fought shoulder to shoulder for the green and the gold. googletag.cmd.push O’Connor played like a man possessed. He played like a man who wanted to show the world he didn’t need a partner. The Foreglen forward took Rian Kealey, a superb player, to the cleaners. O’Connor ended up with five points and set up his side’s goal in a magnicent display. That goal, made by O’Connor and finished by James Brolly, looked as though it had swung the balance in the favour of the underdogs with just four minutes to go. Having been behind from the th minute of a rather stagnant first half, Foreglen had worked incredibly hard to stay in touch with the Magpies. A combination of wasteful finishing from Eugene Kelly’s menand superb defending from a young full-back line of Ruairi and Shane Duffy and Cathal O’Hara kept Damien O’Connor’s side in contention. This was no holds barred football. For the young Dungiven side, sprinkled with Kevin Farren, Kevin Johnston, Sean Murray and Donal McGilligan of last year’s minor team, this was probably the toughest game they’ve played, in a physical sense at least. For that, you have to give Foreglen great credit. Brothers John and Oisin Duffy were lost to their defence before the game, having set off travelling on Friday. They’re without Niall McFeely long term. To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Concern was recently raised that Derry City and Strabane District Council ratepayers were footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the local dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. He asked for vehicles using the council-owned recycling centres to be monitored to assess how big an issue it was. Five of the councils  recycling centres reopened on May  last after being closed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. googletag.cmd.push After the recycling centres reopened, council officers noted the registration of all vehicles using them. The information was collated from Monday, May , to Friday, May . The figures, which have been seen by the Derry News, revealed that during that -day period, a total of , cars with Republic of Ireland number plates used the local dumps. The vast majority of Republic-registered vehicles used the Pennyburn recycling centre - a total of . This was just over % of the overall , vehicles which used the Pennyburn dump during this time. Eighty three vehicles with southern number plates used the Glendermott recycling centre during this period, out of a total of , visitors. googletag.cmd.push There were  southern-registered cars which used the Strahans Road dump in Strabane, out of a total of , visitors. The two other councils dumps that reopened on May  - Strathfoyle and Claudy - had no vehicles from the Republic visit them during the period from May  to May . Derry’s recycling centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal, people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free. The issue of usage of the local recycling centres was discussed last week at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration committee. At the meeting, DUP Alderman Ryan McCready proposed that a special meeting of the committee be organised to discuss a number of issues around the recycling centres This included, he said, the dumping of commercial waste at the centres and the number of people from outside the council jurisdiction using the centres. Alderman McCready stressed that he was speaking about anyone from outside the council area, and not just people from Donegal. His proposal was supported by other councillors on the committee. Meanwhile, van drivers who use the local recycling centres are being advised of new arrangements that will come into place from this week. From today, large vans with trailers will only be permitted entry to Strathfoyle and Strahans Road sites during the following revised times - Strathfoyle, between am and am Monday to Saturday, and at Strahans Road between am and am, Monday to Saturday. No large vans with trailers will be accepted at Pennyburn dump. However, large vans will only be permitted access between am and am, Monday to Saturday. A spokesperson for the council said the new arrangements are in place to assist with traffic management arrangements and for safety reasons.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community. Baroness Ritchie said the furloughing of many staff within the hospitality sector was currently concealing the true extent of the job losses that would follow when the scheme was ended.She also said the pandemic had revealed the ldquodeep levels of poverty and inequalities that are entrenched within many communities.She went on: ldquoThere have been greater levels of dependence on food banks for essential food provisions.

the reinstatement of services at the Downe Hospital.Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Alliance councillor Patrick Brown are both demanding the full restoration of services which were removed at the height of the Covid- pandemic.Baroness Ritchie says she has pressed health chiefs on the issue, but to date has not been given a timeline by the South Eastern Trust.ldquoIt is important that the work on the reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in the Downe Hospital, including medical, nursing and ancillary, have worked with very dficult challenges over the last few months and they deserve our support, solidarity and congratulations.Baroness Ritchie said she had been told equipment will be ed to the Downe and that the Trust was progressing plans for the rebuilding of non-Covid health and social care services.She said she had pressed senior management on the provision of endoscopy services at the Downe and was informed that the service recommenced in the day procedure unit on June .She said  patients were examined during the first session and that the Trust currently had  patients on their lsquored flag escalation listrsquo for endoscopy services.She said priority was being given to those with higher risk of cancer at this stage. ldquoThese patients are getting access to urgent endoscopy usually within the three-week target, she remarked.She added: ldquoIn response to my query about the scoping work for additional services to be provided at the Downe Hospital, the Trust has informed me that planning for the provision of services to be delivered from the day procedure Unit at the Downe Hospital is part of the overall work the Trust is progressing in relation to the rebuilding of non-Covid  health and social services.ldquoIt is also anticipated that other day case surgical work will recommence shortly afterwards.Cllr Brown called on the Trust to reconsider its decision to engage with a private firm to offer endoscopy treatment at the Downe and to reinstate the AE department, as well as investing in what he said were ldquomuch-needed services for the local community.He claimed privatising healthcare put limits on those who could receive treatment.ldquoOur constituents should have access to high quality local services, he said.ldquoWhilst the dficult and unprecedented circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic have undoubtedly added a strain on hospital resources, the decision to involve a private contractor for endoscopy treatments should be swtly reconsidered.ldquoInstead, efforts should be made to find a cohesive solution with current medical staff and relevant unions, in order to safeguard our local services.He continued: ldquoThe decision to close the AE Department in Downe Hospital was taken to reallocate resources and staff to other hospitals to help fight Covid-, especially at the peak of the virus.ldquoWhilst it is understandable that medical services needed to adapt as a response to the outbreak, Downe Hospital failed to have a sufficient offering in terms of emergency medical care prior to the pandemic, with an AE Department that only operated for  hours of the day.Cllr Brown said a global health crisis should not be used as an excuse to remove or rationalise health services.He remarked: ldquoDowne Hospital is a vital local employer and necessary for the health and wellbeing of residents across the District.ldquoLocal rural constituents should not have to worry that they wonrsquot have adequate access to healthcare, as services have been displaced to Belfast or Dundonald.ldquoThere is a clear need to invest in services, restoring those lost

Crops lay flat in the fields from the constant pounding of the rain. As a family of farmers it was an extremely dficult time.ldquoIn between the deluges we managed to scramble our way to the first Irish Senior Cup final and emerged victorious mdash a rare moment of sunshine that year.For Paul, then a teenager still at school, the memories of  years ago are still vivid.ldquoIt was my first year in the st XI, playing alongside my father and Alfie. They were  and  years young at that time and still playing well.ldquoIn fact, the following year, in the same competition, I sat in amazement watching Alfie blast a ton against a Bangor with John Elder leading the attack, having opened the bowling for Ireland against Australia earlier that summer in front of , people at Downpatrick.ldquoAnyway, Alfie smashed nine huge sixes, all clearing the Strangford Road end. This was at a spritely age of .ldquoAll of a sudden I realised the legendary tales of Alfiersquos big hitting were true. Dad always said he hit the ball much further than anyone . That innings remains the most memorable I have seen from a Downpatrick player. saw the ICU as it was then bring in bowl-outs to decide washed-out contests, with all  players trying to hit the stumps in a shoot-out.In the first round Downpatrick faced Leinster and of the  players who aimed, only one was successful mdash the aforementioned Alfie.Downpatrick had reached the final after a famous win in the lionrsquos den of Donemana, with Brian Ferris and Jim Patterson smashing unbeaten fties in an emphatic victory.ldquoThere was a lot of publicity surrounding the Irish Senior Cup which at that time was sponsored by Schweppes, said Paul.ldquoIn the years that followed, just like the inter-pros played for the Guinness Cup, everyone simply called the competition lsquoThe Schweppesrsquo. In more recent times, the Ulster Cup was known as lsquoThe Clubturfrsquo.ldquoBefore the final, BBC TV sent a crew down to interview some of us, and ironically record us bowling at the stumps. It was still raining. It took us ages to hit the stumpshellipI got abuse at school.ldquoNeedless to say, the final was washed out without a bowl bowled and the miserable summer continued. It was desperately disappointing after a week of huge anticipation.The toss for the venue of the replay was conducted over the phone between the two captains, Ian Shields and Derek McCann.Downpatrick won and the replay was scheduled for midweek, Wednesday, September , and North Downrsquos Robin Haire recalls the conditions werenrsquot really fit for cricket.ldquoDownpatrick had actual puddles of water on parts of outfield, he recalled. ldquoMy abiding memory of that final was the spray of the water when you hit it along the ground.ldquoIt was totally unplayable, but the authorities wanted it played and out of the way. Nowadays umpires would have said try tomorrow.The decider itself proved to be a turgid, low-key affair, with little atmosphere and a contest which matched the gloomy conditions.ldquoIt just felt like a midweek league game, said Paul Linehan. ldquoPeople were at work, there was no crowd to speak of, it was cold and it wasnrsquot much of a game.ldquoNorth Down batted first, we bowled and fielded brilliantly, and they scraped to just . Karl Quinn and man of the match Philip Lennon each took three wickets, Jim Patterson got two, while Brian Hodges and Brian Ferris got one apiece.ldquoWe opened with Keith Malone and Derek McCann and I was due to come in three. I was a very nervous  year-old when I arrived at the wicket after they had put on . Keith was going well and I just needed to stay in.ldquoAnyway, desperate to get off the mark, I predicted Robin Haire was going to bowl me a long hop. I was right back on the stumps, ready to smash it, when he fired in a quicker ball which crashed into my ankles in front of middle. Out for a duck in the All-Ireland Cup final. I was beyond devastated as cricket was everything to me.ldquoWe eventually won by six wickets as our experienced side adopted a safety-first attitude, taking no risks. Derek McCann lted the famous trophy and Downpatrick were All-Ireland champions.There were to be no champagne celebrations for the teenager though.ldquoUnfortunately, I was too young to down a couple of beers, so it was straight back home after the final for Dad and I, two All-Ireland champions.Six years later, Downpatrick would secure the trophy for the second time in one of the most thrilling encounters ever, overcoming North by three runs.There was to be no personal glory though for Paul Linehan as he missed out on the chance of redemption.ldquoThe disappointment of making a duck remains as I was never to play in another All-Ireland final, having been injured for the  victory, he said.ldquoHowever, all these years later, my  medal is still very much a prized possession..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C June 10%2C 2000  ","story":"TYRELLA mdash Tyrella beach has retained a prestigious European award which recognises the quality of the local tourist facility.The beach is one of eight in the province to receive the highly sought after Blue Flag Award, the highest possible recognition for cleanliness.Down Council chiefs are delighted Tyrella has once again been recognised for its quality, and the amount of effort they put into maintaining it, in the annual Tidy Britain Group awards.The awards were officially handed over on Monday along with the prestigious Blue Flag which will continue to fly high over Tyrella for the next  months.The beach was rigorously examined in an unannounced inspection by a  of European experts who focused their attention on cleanliness and the environmental management of Tyrella.Council official Leonard Lawson said everyone was delighted their efforts have again been recognised.ldquoThe award also recognises the councilrsquos effort to manage the beach, provide information points, educational material and detailed displays in the beach centre, he said.ldquoThe water quality is also critical to ensure Blue Flag status is retailed and the council aims to continue to work hard to maintain its high standards.NEWCASTLE mdash Armed robbers made off with over pound, in cash yesterday morning after a hold-up at a Newcastle bank.The three masked men burst into the Northern Bank in Main Street at .am and order everyone inside to co-operate.

It is hard to believe that it has taken  years to get to the stage we are at now at, but the sight of new homes going up is welcome, he continued.ldquoWhile the regeneration of this part of Downpatrick is vital, so is the impact the new homes project will have on addressing a critical shortage of social housing. Many of those in need of a new home are in the urgent need category and the sooner tenants can start to move in, the better.Cllr Curran explained that those in the urgent need category are the priority as far as housing providers are concerned.He also hopes that given the progress that is being made at the former hospital site that families may be able to move in before December.The councillor said the new social housing project will benefit the wider community by providing construction jobs and boosting buildersrsquo suppliers and hopes that those on the waiting list for homes in the town will be offered the new properties.He added: ldquoThis eagerly-awaited scheme is ridding Downpatrick of a derelict site which will be transformed to deliver modern homes in an area of high demand.Local SDLP MLA Colin McGrath also welcomed the plannersrsquo approval.He said: ldquoThe housing development at the old Downe site has been a protracted and drawn out process.ldquoHaving been in regular contact with Clanmil to see what were the outstanding issues holding this development back to hear that council planners are to approve the next stage of the development at long last is very

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area.

Following a prolonged period of dry weather water levels have dropped to around %. It hasnt been that low since .

That is what happens when whole tiers of economic activity have to shut .Explanations are needed as to the wisdom of some uses of taxpayer or ratepayer funds in this crisis, such as NI councils topping up the UK’s very generous furlough scheme so that the income of council employees on the scheme was untouched. Transparency is all the more important when there are huge demands on the public purse and when government will be essential to the recovery and must be wisely spent.Now is an obvious time to improve infrastructure. It puts money in the economy, it employs people and it leaves society with a lasting asset. Some critics will want to demote road building, given that people around the world have enjoyed the way lockdown has led to less traffic and less polluted cities. But that does not mean we should reject the car, when we can instead embrace new technologies such as electric vehicles. The road upgrades that Nichola Mallon says her infrastructure department will now advance across Northern Ireland are all needed.

The Protocol was the compromise that avoided a no deal exit, it is vital now that the EU and UK work together to protect the peace and prosperity of those who will be impacted by it - the businesses and consumers of Northern Ireland. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The Protocol is only one part of the jigsaw, and companies will have their heads in their hands about the worrying lack of progress following the latest round of talks. Anxiety is mounting amongst the Northern Irish business community that, let’s face it, has little resilience to spare.As we’ve begun to take the first tentative steps into the recovery phase, every decimal point of economic growth has to be fought for.With limited growth plaguing Northern Ireland’s economy for years, long before this current crisis emerged, the task is more urgent than ever before. The bottom line is getting a good Brexit deal for our economy is essential.That’s why businesses across the UK expect negotiators on both sides to approach talks with a determination to deliver.Negotiation by videoconference is far from perfect, preventing the kind of side-line conversations that can help smooth dferences in formal talks. Even more limiting is adhering to rigid negotiating mandates. Unless the dynamic shts in this latest round of accelerated talks, it looks like both sides will stay trapped in a holding pattern, with no trade deal a real possibility at the end of the year, when the transition period is scheduled to end. For businesses, jobs and economic confidence in this most challenging of years, that would be a shocking outcome which must not come to pass.For many Northern Irish firms fighting to survive, the idea of preparing for a chaotic change in trading relations with Great Britain in seven months is beyond them. They aren’t remotely prepared. Stockpiles built to weather a Brexit storm are long depleted and supply chains are fragmented by an unprecedented global pandemic. Many NI businesses, especially smaller ones, have burned through cash reserves they would have otherwise used for rainy days. On top of this, the support from the Jobs Retention Scheme and rates relief will be coming to an end for many businesses.The net impact of no deal would be higher unemployment at a time when we will be fighting for every job. Signicant losses, particularly in our manufacturing, retail and hospitality sectors, would simply be devastating for local communities and our economy.For everyone’s sake, the Protocol taking effect in a clf-edge scenario is not the answer. What is more, Northern Ireland will not benefit from the proposed flexibilities on post-transition border controls on goods, announced last week by the UK government.So, what needs to happen now Political leaders across Europe have shown in recent months that what previously may have been thought of as impossible, is not. They need to use that determination and leadership to find a route through in the talks.This must continue, building upon the conversation yesterday between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.The global pandemic could end up claiming many jobs in Northern Ireland, and possibly millions across these islands. The stakes are higher than ever before. Walking away with no deal would be a major block to recovery. It would worsen inequalities, damaging regional and national growth. Many businesses are not – and cannot – prepare for the impact of no deal on top of what is happening.The UK Government has repeatedly ruled out an extension to the transition period, which means firms therefore have no choice but to plan on that basis. But that means a deal is now the only acceptable option.A good deal with the EU with a sustainable agreement on the implementation of the Protocol is necessary for renewal. As businesses start to get up and dust themselves off, and as we sht from revive to recover, a recovery plan that reaches all parts of Northern Ireland is essential. Every opportunity for growth must be seized, particularly to support young people and kick-start demand.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the

causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

He suggested that in these exceptional circumstances quick decisions are essential to suit local issues.“This is highlighted by the recent decision by the Minister for Infrastructure to ask councils to relax the rules for on-street cafes and bars and also the Department’s investigation into potential widening of pavements to help with social distancing.”“The decision to provide more flexibility on pavement use is welcomed, subject to ensuring disabled access is maintained, and greater pedestrianisation is something that is increasingly seen as a way to help revitalise our towns. But without visibility of these decisions or the processes, timescales and likelihood of funding it is extremely dficult to plan.”“I believe that strategic planning of transport, funding decisions and the development of our townscapes will have a huge bearing on the success of our economic recovery. For example, I believe that a new railway station and park and ride facility in the Rushmere area of Craigavon could create an economic development and sustainable transport hub which would benefit the wider area, including those travelling from Armagh.”“Connectivity is key and enhanced transport links with Belfast and Dublin, the strategic development of the A corridor in Banbridge, and sustainable linkages to build our tourism sector could create new jobs and opportunities. Successfully connecting people and places.”“However, the correct powers and funding decisions are needed to deliver any strategic plan and vision.”“A closer partnership arrangement between councils and the Executive Departments would be a good start. But in these unprecedented times, where pressure is building on businesses, jobs and our citizens there could well be a clamour for greater local control.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up. It sets out some of the important preparation work needed to provide COVID- safe environments and working practices, to protect our staff, patients and service users. There are a number of constraints which are foremost in the planning process, including availability of PPE availability of drugs and restrictions on the practice of vulnerable staff.Our Stage  plan will focus on:Supporting strong community services for frail or older people. Preparing for the impact of the COVID- pandemic on mental health services. Managing risk, and providing COVID--safe services for staff and our service users. Involving our staff and service users.Speaking about the launch of Stage  of the Trust’s Reset Plan, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Western Trust chief executive, said: “There is no doubt that this has been one of the most dficult periods we have ever had to experience.I would like to thank our community and hospital staff for their hard work and dedication. Members of the public have also been unwavering in their support and this has not gone unnoticed. “There are many challenges which we have faced and will continue to face in the new COVID- environment. Our Stage  plan sets out the steps we are taking to rebuild, reset and make necessary changes to our services into the future.“It is accepted that COVID- remains a public health risk to our population and a phased and flexible approach is needed to restarting services. As a result, the way services are delivered may look and feel dferent. There are opportunities to do things dferently in ways that improve care. Many great initiatives have already begun.” Dr Kilgallen continued: “While there are signicant challenges ahead, the public should be reassured that we are committed to providing the best possible care in environments that reduce the risk of infection for staff and services users alike.
