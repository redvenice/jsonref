The singer was having lunch at his Algarve retreat in August 2014 when the police raided his luxury apartmentThe ramifications of that dramatic raid on August 14, 2014, are still being felt today. But the sorry saga started two months earlier when BBC reporter Dan Johnson received a tip-off from a confidential source.It was at the height of Operation Yewtree, the extraordinary Metropolitan Police investigation into a string of celebrities following the Jimmy Savile scandal.A junior but ambitious reporter, Mr Johnson said his tipster had revealed there was ‘one more high profile person being investigated’. The reference was oblique, but the journalist guessed correctly it was Sir Cliff. And when the source told Mr Johnson, whose BBC patch is the north of England, that the investigation was ‘closer to home’, he also worked out it involved South Yorkshire Police.Although Mr Johnson never named his source, the court ruled yesterday it was most probably either a police officer from the Yewtree inquiry or someone associated with the police.The reporter was on the trail of what his boss called a ‘bloody cracking’ scoop – but he was described by the judge as ‘capable of letting his enthusiasm for his story get the better of his complete regard for truth’.‘BLACKMAILING’ THE POLICEOn July 9, armed with his sensational tip, Mr Johnson spoke on the phone to South Yorkshire Police’s head of communications, Carrie Goodwin. When he casually asked whether Sir Cliff was ‘on their radar’, she gave ‘an audible gasp’, he told the court.          Police officers search the property of pop star Sir Cliff Richards in Sunningdale, Berkshire in August 2014. Sir Cliff watched the breaking news Miss Goodwin, who had been privately briefed about the highly sensitive investigation by police chiefs, remarked that he had good sources, claimed Mr Johnson.Miss Goodwin told Matthew Fenwick, the detective superintendent leading the investigation, and chief constable David Crompton. The police say they decided to co-operate with the BBC to avoid the story being broadcast and tipping off their suspect before they were ready to swoop on his home.They invited Mr Johnson in for a meeting. At 1pm on July 15, he met Miss Goodwin and Mr Fenwick – and their discussion is hotly contested.The reporter claimed police voluntarily gave him information about their investigation, confirming it involved a 13-year-old boy allegedly sexually assaulted in a dressing room after a Billy Graham event in Sheffield in the 1980s.But the force said Mr Johnson already knew these details and used them to ‘blackmail’ police into giving the BBC advance notice of their raid on Sir Cliff’s apartment.Either way, a deal was struck. Miss Goodwin said the police would give Mr Johnson the date and location of the search if he agreed not to broadcast the information in advance.EXCITEMENT AT THE BBCJubilant that his ‘tactics’ had worked, Mr Johnson told his BBC editor Declan Wilson, who passed it on to his own boss, Gary Smith, with an email entitled: ‘Sit down when you read this.’In reply, Mr Smith quoted from Sir Cliff’s 1968 Eurovision Song Contest entry by saying: ‘Congratulations. And jubilations. I want the world to know I’m happy as can be.’ Mr Wilson claimed police had even considered arresting tennis fan Sir Cliff at Wimbledon, adding: ‘Off record, they want the publicity as they believe there are others.’          A very emotional looking Sir Cliff Richard seen leaving the High Court after winning his battle with the BBC. The judge said: ‘Excitement was being created in the BBC over the prospect of the story.’ When Mr Johnson was asked by his boss how he had managed to persuade the police, he said he had got detectives ‘over a barrel because of the tip-off I had received’.On the evening of August 13, police stuck to their deal and gave the journalist the details he needed. They even emailed him an aerial photo of the apartment block.The BBC machine swung into action. Camera teams were dispatched to the apartment in Berkshire, police HQ in Sheffield, Sir Cliff’s home in the Algarve and his other home in Barbados. And that helicopter was fired up.Mr Smith, the BBC’s UK news editor, wrote in a gleeful email: ‘The money shots will be police going in and out of his flat and loading bags of hard drives or whatever into their vans. We can only get this from the helicopter.’BBC BEAT POLICE TO THE DOOROn the morning of August 14, Operation Kaddie was launched – and hapless police found the BBC were already there.Mr Johnson and two other reporters and their crews had set up camera angles well before 9am, ready to cover the drama live. As the helicopter hovered overhead, a police press officer updated Mr Johnson with text messages.Woman \u0027saw a black Mercedes like the one owned by Borce...Share this articleIn five cars, eight police officers entered the gated estate at 9.35am. They spoke to a building manager who phoned Sir Cliff in Portugal to tell him police had arrived with a warrant to search his home. Sir Cliff later told how, as a decent, law-abiding citizen, all he thought was that he must help the police and instructed the manager to ‘Please let them in’.Police entered the apartment at 10.40am, and three minutes later Mr Johnson was informed by text.From the camera in the helicopter, officers were filmed going through the singer’s possessions. And on the ground, an officer read a prepared statement to a BBC crew. By now, Sir Cliff’s lawyers had been alerted too and were racing to the scene.A ‘HUDDLE’ IN THE NEWSROOMIn the BBC newsroom at 12.15pm, managers held a ‘huddle’ to discuss their scoop and whether to name Sir Cliff, even though police had not. The go-ahead was given by deputy director of news Fran Unsworth, who considered it ‘strongly’ in the public interest.At 1pm the BBC unveiled its ‘top story this lunchtime’ along with dramatic footage of the police raid.          News helicopter images of police arriving to search the Berkshire property belonging to Sir Cliff Richard in relation to an alleged historical sex offence. The ‘vile’ allegations hung over him for almost two years until the police dropped the case without any charges The broadcast went live to Mr Johnson outside the property, and he continued his breathless reports on the BBC News Channel all afternoon. In total there were 44 BBC TV broadcasts that afternoon, with Sir Cliff’s strenuous denials added to the reports from 2pm.A BBC editor, Richard Clark, sent Mr Johnson a congratulatory email saying: ‘Good work, Dan. Well done.’ The reporter replied it was ‘old-fashioned journalism’.But by the evening, an explosive row was brewing.THE FALLOUTOn Radio 4’s Six O’Clock News, respected home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw suggested the BBC’s tip-off had been an ‘attempt by the police to ensure maximum coverage’ of the raid.South Yorkshire Police responded angrily, saying they had not tipped off Mr Johnson, who had ‘blackmailed’ them. Press chief Miss Goodwin complained to him: ‘This wasn’t the case and brings the force into disrepute.’She wrote to her chief constable: ‘It’s wildly inaccurate. The Met leaked it and we asked the BBC not to run it.’ As police prepared an explosive press release claiming the BBC had been fed the tip by Operation Yewtree, Mr Johnson, knowing his tip-off had come from someone outside South Yorkshire Police, begged his superiors to put out a correction to the Danny Shaw report.

All of them add into the mix of what happened and how this sub was operated,\u0027 Scafuri said. \u0027After all, we don\u0027t have the blueprints.\u0027The keel blocks go on display at the Hunley\u0027s North Charleston museum Saturday.           Workers lifting a keel block from the Hunley submarine, out of a 75,000 gallon conservation tank at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center          A Clemson University conservator attempting to separate the keel block from the Hunley at the Warren Lash Conservation Center in North Charleston, South Carolina          The submarine sank once while docked with its hatches open in August 1863.

No,\u0027 Scafuri said.The next step for scientists is to remove more of the corrosion, slit and other material collected on the hull.                Ever since the Hunley was raised from the ocean floor in 2000, scientists have worked to determine why the sub never returned to the surface          The sub itself is only four feet in diameter.

The girl went to Memorial Park in Herne Bay thinking this was where her friend was, but was unable to find her.          An inquest ruled that Ms Peebles died as a result of an accident          A toxicology report found Ms Peebles, 16, was twice the legal drink drive limit when she diedMs Peebles\u0027s boyfriend Adam Wilson, now 17, spoke through tears as he explained his final day with her.It was heard the two had an argument during the evening and each went off with their own group of friends on the train.Mr Wilson explained that after realising she was not with the group once they got off, he repeatedly tried calling his girlfriend but failed to reach her.          An inquest ruled that Ms Peebles\u0027s death was accidentalHe said: \u0027She wouldn\u0027t answer at all. That\u0027s when I really started to worry. I went back to my friend\u0027s house. I couldn\u0027t sleep so I left in the morning.\u0027I walked past the station and there were lots of ambulances outside.\u0027I was worried, so I went to her house and looked in her bedroom window on the ground floor. But she was not there.\u0027Mr Wilson received a call from one of his friends telling him it was his girlfriend\u0027s body that had been found near the railway station.Along with another of her friends, Mr Wilson went back to Ms Peebles\u0027 house and broke the news to her mother, Hayley Peebles.A friend Hannah Brooker said Ms Peebles had been emotional during the evening and at one point told her she \u0027felt like she had no one\u0027.Ms Brooker reassured her this was not true and said she put her mood down to alcohol and others noted she had seemed \u0027jolly\u0027.Her mother was adamant Ms Peebles would not have taken her own life.\u0027That would never even cross my mind,\u0027 she said.\u0027She used to get emotional when she got drunk but that\u0027s true of the majority of people.\u0027The post-mortem suggested Ms Peebles had been electrocuted after touching a live rail shortly after she got off the train and would have died instantly.Toxicology tests also found she had a blood alcohol level around twice that of the legal drink drive limit.While she had suffered some burns and other injuries to the head and body, there was nothing to suggest she had been assaulted.Assistant coroner Ian Goldup ruled the death to be accidental.He said: \u0027Her telephone calls to her friends indicate she was lost and unable to help herself.\u0027The coroner stated he will be writing to Network Rail suggesting action be taken to prevent others from dying as Taiyah did.Mrs Peebles said she wants to see railway stations made safer following her daughter\u0027s tragic death          Friends of Ms Peebles have painted a mural in tribute for the tragic teenagerSpeaking in tribute to her daughter, Mrs Peebles said: \u0027She was a law unto herself. She was very bubbly. She loved to be out with her friends. She loved spending time with her sisters and nieces.\u0027She lived every day of her life like it was the last.\u0027While barriers have since been put up at Herne Bay station, Mrs Peebles said this is not enough and she wants stations across the country to be made safer.She continued: \u0027I am just flabbergasted at the amount of deaths which have happened on the railway and nothing is done. \u0027It seems it does not matter how many lives they take nothing is done.\u0027They are just another statistic. I am not going to let Taiyah become just another statistic.\u0027Speaking after the inquest, she said: \u0027I am now on a mission to get all the train stations made safe so no one will have to go through what I have.\u0027We would like to make children and young adults aware of the dangers of railways. People think it\u0027s safe to travel on the railway if you\u0027re intoxicated, but obviously, it wasn\u0027t that safe for Taiyah.\u0027Think before you play on the railways.

The Jewish state.\u0027\u0027Lately, there are people who are trying to destabilize this and therefore destabilize the foundations of our existence and our rights,\u0027 he added. \u0027So today we have made a law in stone. This is our country. This is our language. This is our anthem and this is our flag. Long live the state of Israel.\u0027Israel\u0027s 1948 declaration of independence defined its nature as a Jewish and democratic state, a delicate balance the country has grappled to maintain for 70 years.Opponents of the new bill say it marginalizes the country\u0027s Arab minority of around 20 per cent and also downgrades Arabic language from official to \u0027special\u0027 standing.The law passed with a 62-55 backing, with two members of the Knesset abstaining.

Last year Mr Wilson sent this note to letting agents outlining his rules for which tenants he would rent to, including single mothersMr Wilson said he is \u0027not the bad guy\u0027  and claims the rules of Ashford Borough Council forced his hand.Mr Wilson said that the council\u0027s new policy on landlords having to fix boilers \u0027within four days\u0027 if the tenant is a single mum with a baby, were too restrictive\u0027 and that he couldn\u0027t always get a plumber round within the four day period.Landlords who miss targets face being fined by the council for breaching tenancy agreements if they don\u0027t stuck to rules in its \u0027emergency maintenance policy\u0027, which state that homes with newborns should have boilers and heating fixed \u0027within four days\u0027. Mr Wilson said he was giving the evicted single mothers \u0027two months\u0027 grace\u0027 to find somewhere else to live.He told the Kentish Express: \u0027I just can\u0027t risk something going wrong and not being able to get a plumber there in time - have you ever tried to get a plumber, there\u0027s a national shortage.\u0027          Multi-millionaire Mr Wilson, pictured with wife Judith, said he was \u0027forced\u0027 into the evictions over \u0027strict\u0027 council rules that could leave him with huge fines should heating systems break down homes in which babies liveIn a letter to Cllr Gerald White, Ashford Borough Council\u0027s cabinet member for housing, Mr Wilson wrote: \u0027It is heart-breaking to terminate the contracts, but we cannot recruit staff and service the tenants.\u0027The council has brought this decision on itself.\u0027 He added: \u0027If there was a problem with hot water then we cannot get a gas safety engineer in under four days - the council requires the work be done \u0027immediately\u0027.\u0027We know we will not be able to comply with that expectation so (I) have brought these tenancies to an end.\u0027He added that he is only willing to take on mothers with children who are over the age of five, as council rules are more relaxed concerning them.Earlier this month Ashford Borough Council announced that rogue landlords faced fines of up to £30,000 if they ignore their legal responsibilities after adopting new enforcement powers, which can be dealt with by way of civil penalties, rather than through the criminal courts.Speaking earlier this month, Cllr Gerald White said he was delighted at the new enforcement powers, adding: \u0027I\u0027m supportive of the proposed implementation of the civil penalty policy to allow the council to consider imposing fines on landlords who fail to comply with housing law, as an alternative to prosecution.\u0027Implementing the policy will hopefully deter landlords from failing in their responsibilities in providing safe homes and ensuring that they comply with the relevant housing law.\u0027A spokesman for Ashford Borough Council said it only used enforcement action against landlords as a \u0027last resort\u0027.          Mr Wilson owns many properties in the Park Farm area of Ashford, picturedHe said: \u0027We have duty to ensure decent standards for tenant who are renting privately.\u0027We always work with landlords to ensure those standards are met and try to assist them as much as possible.\u0027Formal enforcement action is very much a last resort, but we will take action where necessary.\u0027Mr Wilson was taken to court by the Equality and Human Rights Commission over his attempts to \u0027ban\u0027 Pakistani and Indian tenants and it was ruled unlawful because it was discriminatory.He was handed a three-year injunction banning him from stopping tenants renting his homes because of their race - and he could be fined or face time in jail if he breaches it.At the height of the couple\u0027s property empire, the former maths teachers owned just under 1,000 homes - mainly two and three bed properties - worth just under £200million.Despite selling off around 400 homes in recent times, Mr Wilson and his wife still have a large property portfolio."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/19/12/4E65395700000578-0-image-m-16_1531998281736.jpg","title":"Shocking moment lorry driver takes hands wheel 13 ton truck","story":"    This lorry driver was filmed by police taking both hands off the steering wheel          This driver can be clearly seen with both hands off the steering wheel           Officers also saw this van driver with both hands off the steering wheel on the A338 in DorsetBut hunger got the better of him and he couldn\u0027t resist tucking into his lunch without stopping.He was one of several drivers caught flouting the law as they drove along the A338 in Bournemouth, Dorset.Other offenders included a van driver using both hands to refill his vape device - despite there being a passenger next to him who could have safely done it.Sergeant Mark Farrow, of Dorset Police, said: \u0027As an officer who deals with the often tragic aftermath when a driver is distracted at the wheel, I would like to make a personal plea to the driving public who think it is OK to use a mobile phone while driving to seriously consider their actions.\u0027Nothing is more important than your safety and the safety of other road users and, while you think you can get away with it, it is vital that drivers realise they could kill someone.\u0027We are urging drivers to take responsibility for their actions and leave their phone alone.\u0027          This van driver appears to be holding a mobile phone while behind the wheel          The driver does not appear to have both of his hands on the steering wheel of his vanIt is illegal to hold and use a phone while driving.

If this happened on the truck, we might release them for a run in nature, but you can\u0027t do that on the plane,\u0027 he said.Prague Zoo, which has bred Przewalski\u0027s horses since 1932 and keeps the world genealogy book for the endangered species tracking all new births, launched a project to reintroduce the animals to Mongolia in 2011.The four round-bellied, short-legged, sandy-beige mares are set to join wild herds in Takhin Tal (meaning the wild horse steppe), where 220 Przewalski\u0027s horses now gallop free.In 1969, there was just one. \u0027These horses are getting a chance others won\u0027t have. They\u0027ll return home,\u0027 said Jan Marek, a Prague Zoo curator in charge of ungulates.

Zookeepers from Prague Zoo perform their final checks on the unconscious animal before loading it into a crate for transportation to Mongolia\u0027All the living Przewalski\u0027s horses come from a genetic bottleneck of about 10 animals,\u0027 he told AFP. Zoologists hope the four new mares from different zoos will improve the genetic mix of the Mongolian herd.\u0027If we only brought Czech horses, it would be the same blood. We\u0027re trying to make the population as erse as possible,\u0027 says curator Marek.New genetic research has suggested that the stocky horses that inspired dreamy pre-historic cave paintings are not the world\u0027s last remaining wild horse as had been thought.The journal Science reported in February that, despite their pre-historic looks, Przewalski\u0027s horses were actually domesticated animals that escaped their human owner in the Botai area of northern Kazakhstan around 5,500 years ago.Bobek described the study as \u0027very interesting\u0027, but is cautious.\u0027It could have been the other way round the wild Przewalski\u0027s horse could have been the source for Botai breeders,\u0027 he said.\u0027In any case, the uniqueness of Przewalski\u0027s horse is obvious.

Her father missed her wedding. He missed walking her down the isle all because of that ill-conceived publicity stunt.

It has warned that profits have been hit by lower than expected sales, with profit margins also down as a result of having to cut prices to match rivals.Kempster said the firm was “very happy with the results”, adding: “In a tough market maintaining sales is OK.” Kempster said Sports Direct had benefited from England’s run in the World Cup as fans snapped up replica shirts. However, Kempster described the overall World Cup impact on trade as only “a blip” because the retailer was now an international business and included fashion chains such as Flannels and USC.Despite the financial blow from the Debenhams investment, Kempster said strategic punts on the shares of rival retailers were “part of our DNA”. He said Sports Direct was talking to the ailing department store about initiatives that might help both retailers.Sports Direct said it was continuing to pay all staff, including casual workers, hourly rates above the national minimum wage, as well as commission and other rewards worth £20m a year.The unusual statement followed a  investigation in 2015 which found that temporary workers at Sports Direct were effectively receiving hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage.“There aren’t many companies that feel the need to state compliance with the National Living Wage in their annual results – but then Sports Direct isn’t renowned for diligently following corporate etiquette,” said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5896c86a28b4571b792df99969903d5e6670a30/0_189_5667_3400/master/5667.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df7800ec5ef8db69d87dca3100f66da8","title":"cadbury to launch dairy milk with 30 per cent less sugar","story":"Customers can choose between original and new version, which has extra fibreThe lower-sugar bar took a team of 20 scientists, nutritionists and chocolatiers almost two years to finesse, the company said. The recipe does not rely on artificial sweeteners, colours or preservatives but instead includes more fibre in place of some of the sugar.However, the confectionery giant is not risking the wrath of Dairy Milk aficionados and intends to sell the new bar alongside those made to the original recipe, even though it insists the diet versions taste as good.“We’ve tested this with hundreds of consumers and they love it,” said Glenn Caton, president of Northern Europe of Mondelēz International, the US multinational company that bought Cadbury in 2010.“It’s very tricky to reformulate chocolate because it’s just cocoa, sugar and milk and if you take one thing out, it changes the structure,” said Caton, who claimed he could barely taste the difference between the two bars. “We’ve used fibre as an alternative to some of the sugar and found it doesn’t have a negative impact on the taste or structure.”The food industry is under growing pressure from the government to cut the sugar content of their products amid an obesity crisis that has made the UK the most overweight nation in western Europe. In April the sugar tax came into effect but before that deadline many drinks, including Irn-Bru, Sprite, Fanta and Dr Pepper had been reformulated to avoid the new tax or avoid its highest rates.Dairy Milk was launched by George Cadbury, a scion of the founding Quaker family, in Britain in 1905 and is the UK’s biggest selling brand. However, despite rising levels of obesity, chocolate sales are actually in decline, due to major supermarkets moving confectionery away from their checkouts and alternative sugar hits provided by high street chains.“We’re pleased that Mondelez is the latest household name to commit to offering healthier products,” said Dr Alison Tedstone, the chief nutritionist at PHE. “This announcement shows reducing sugar in chocolate confectionary is possible and we look forward to seeing future reductions across more of its confectionary range.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59408d7c57c68a6a97f1e4929b637e0c14faade4/32_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d4c0eb810ea31e238e8eecc75831004","title":"no deal brexit britain eu wto march","story":"Now they are talking car crashes. From Brussels comes Project Fear Mk II, a “preparedness” guide for Europe if there is no deal on Brexit. It is Brussels-speak for a terrorism red alert. It covers such things as passports, air traffic control, financial transfers, military bases, data protection, medicines licensing and all the border clutter we have spent half a century removing. Unlike the remainers’ bloodcurdling Project Fear in 2016, this is not an economic fake forecast. It is frontline reality. It is Brexit as Grand Theft Auto.Britain’s National Audit Office is joining in. This week it warned that, as of next March, Britons driving on the continent will need new driving permits in the event of a no-deal Brexit. There must be gigantic laybys for traffic jams at Folkestone and staff for “huge bureaucratic delays”. Airbus and Rolls-Royce are already stockpiling spares against a new tariff regime. AstraZeneca is stockpiling medicines. Theresa May is touring the Irish border, like a field-marshal surveying trenches\u0026nbspon\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspSomme.Do we laugh or cry? I am still laughing, just. The car-crash option is favoured by some leave ideologues. They are technically right that in March a no-deal UK would “crash out” of the EU and revert to World Trade Organization rules. Such anarchy has disruptive appeal to those careless of other people’s jobs, while “taking back control of borders” would meet the leavers’ prime target of stricter immigration control. But the EU allows no new deals with third-party countries, under WTO rules or whatever, until the UK is out next year. In March, ports would swiftly clog up. The movement of people and tourism would plummet. It would be chaos, and even after that “new deals with the rest of the world” could not possibly compensate.In reality, everyone knowledgeable about Brexit agrees on what will really happen if there is no deal in March. Nothing will change. Planes will keep flying. Ferries will keep loading. Channel Tunnel officials will wave vehicles through. Orders will go out to keep moving, and await further instructions. People at the coalface of the European economy cannot afford the posturing, vanity and idiocy of the Brexit parliament this past week. They have lives to live and mouths to feed. A closed border with the EU, not least in Ireland, would be like closing the Berlin Wall after it had reopened. There would be riots. That is why crashing out would not mean hard Brexit, but rather remain in all but name. When Brexit fantasy hits practical reality, reality will win.Hard Brexit was surely put to bed by Boris Johnson’s resignation speech in the Commons this week, a confection of negativity and verbosity. He offered no “frictionless” alternative to a customs union with the rest of Europe. The UK may be leaving the EU – for which I believe there is something to be said – but it makes no sense to erect trade barriers between an island and its neighbouring continent. Britain has spent a century moving in the opposite direction. Even in the 1950s, when it dreamed of a greater imperial market, it joined Europe’s free trade zone, forerunner of the present European Economic Area. Hard Brexit is flat-Earthism.The failure of the House of Commons this week to vote in favour of a customs union, as opposed to May’s botched Chequers plan, was a lost opportunity. Johnson might call the plan a “fantastical Heath Robinson arrangement”, but that was because May changed it to win his support. It is his fault. She should not have bothered. As a result, the opportunity to negotiate a customs union in Brussels from a united, bipartisan base with Labour was scuppered.The public was promised Brexit, which, as May keeps\u0026nbspsaying, means Brexit. That is happening. It was also promised frictionless trade, which means frictionless. That is achievable only under a customs union and single market.As a result of the current shambles, the new Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, must go to Brussels to negotiate “frictionless” on the basis of Chequers, not a simple customs union. The difference is over agreeing tariff collection and regulatory alignment on trading standards. This is all but trivial. Even if the UK were to go for hard Brexit, trade with the EU would still need some such agreement, as would the much-vaunted, largely fantasy, deals with the rest of the world. Talk of Chequers as “vassalage” is ludicrous. Taking back control of trade was always making a mountain of a molehill.The outcome of Raab’s negotiations will be messier than were he negotiating on the basis of remaining in the EEA. But the destination has to be the same. There may be more bloodletting ahead but, come the autumn, I am sure we will all be in sight of the Norway option. Whatever may one day be agreed on migration – still Brexit’s hard core and still to be negotiated – a customs union between the nations of Europe cannot be avoided.Prudent government should always be on guard against car crashes. It is not scaremongering to inspect the fenders and check the airbags. But a crash on Brexit will not happen, and even if it did, the outcome would not be “crashing out” of Europe but rather crashing in. The UK is going to leave the EU next spring. That is law. But no one was asked if they wanted to leave Europe’s economic community. We were promised frictionless. If Westminster’s midsummer madness does lead to a car crash, so be it. In the longer run it will make no difference. Keep laughing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d3341c13d955c4c9d0142243deefad69e0a5d3a/0_56_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=816477a258b1f6f5b01cd6163b3ba0ef","title":"the guardian view on religious education bring it up to date","story":"In modern secular societies such as Britain, there is a tendency to think “religion” is something that other people do. When we do not understand what it means in the lives of believers, we are unable to understand either them or ourselves properly and in a world where\u0026nbspglobalisation has shoved communities with wildly\u0026nbspdifferent values into close proximity, this is dangerous.The obvious answer is to teach religion properly in schools – rather than haphazardly, as in England at present. The legal framework was set out 75 years ago, when this was a very different and uncontroversially Christian country. The assumption was that Christianity should be taught and practised in all state schools. The main means of practice would be a daily assembly that would include an explicitly Christian act of worship, something which has since been modified to suggest that\u0026nbspit be of a mainly Christian character.This law is largely ignored in practice. Outside of a few faith schools, there is no enthusiasm for using the school’s assembly to proselytise for a faith that neither the teachers nor the children are likely to share. Meanwhile, there is no national curriculum for religious teaching rather than practice. While most children learn about synagogues and the Guru Granth Sahib, the syllabus is highly variable (as is its quality) and very seldom includes material on the kind of “no religion” humanism that is the faith system of most young people in the UK today.In a new pamphlet, Charles Clarke, a former education secretary and home secretary, and Linda Woodhead, a sociologist of religion, suggest a long-overdue cleanup of this mess. “Religious education” would be replaced by “religion, beliefs and values”, compulsory in all schools up to the sixth form. It would include humanism as a belief system. Faith schools would add to the subject according to their own beliefs, but the core of the curriculum would be compulsory in all state-funded schools. Its content would be set by a panel of experts representing humanism as well as recognised faiths, but chosen for educational expertise rather than as champions of their own viewpoints.The ultimate aim would be to help pupils recognise and reflect on their own values so that they can see what they have in common with others. Values are difficult to examine because they are expressed implicitly in what we do, and then justified explicitly by the stories we tell and the rhetoric we use. One of the purposes of education in religions, beliefs, and values, is to recognise the different forms of understanding represented by other religions and belief systems in order better to understand our own. Another is to understand strangers for their own sake. It is not enough to teach religion as a kind of anthropology. The ultimate purpose must be a much deeper sympathy within and between communities. Genuine and irreconcilable differences will sometimes emerge. On some matters, such as equality and ersity, there is only limited compromise possible with certain religious interpretations. But such disagreements are less damaging when they are out in the open. The essential thing is to grasp that beliefs and values hold together every community and every human life. They have to be lived before they can be discussed. In a erse and multi-faith country, schools need to become places where values are both lived and examined. A reformed education in belief is an essential part of that process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e410386f075740615b20193557f7a1da62b2d57f/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc900175a27b5adfc15e6d96488a050a","title":"uk student loans 600m lost repayments treasury dfe","story":"Watchdog highly critical of Treasury calculations that differ from DfE forecastsA clash between the Department for Education and the Treasury over how to value the government’s student loans portfolio may have led to more than £600m in income from future loan repayments being overlooked, the National Audit Office (NAO) has warned.The watchdog also advised that the government should take “a comprehensive view” and carefully consider the potential impact on the government’s finances of future loan sales.Examining last year’s sale of a tranche of loans to 400,000 students, the NAO was highly critical of the Treasury’s calculations and their differences over likely repayment rates from the DfE’s forecasts.“This reduces transparency and risks government not knowing the ultimate value and cost to the taxpayer of student loans when they are issued, and of selling assets too cheaply.”The NAO said the government’s sale of the first batch of student loans was carried out efficiently and achieved value for money by selling at the upper estimate of what the market was expected to pay. But it criticised the gap between the valuation used by the Treasury and those by other government forecasts of repayment rates.“The inherent limitations in the way the government assesses the value of student loans when selling them increases the risk that they could be sold at too low a price,” said Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO.“The rapidly growing student loan book is a significant government asset, so I would expect to see greater consideration of the financial impact of selling and awareness of whether this provides value for money to taxpayers.”In response, a government spokesperson said the NAO’s report recognised that the sale of the pre-2012 student loan book “was conducted efficiently, represented good value for money for taxpayers, and does not affect borrowers”, as well as raising £1.7bn.“Student loans are designed so that borrowers only repay when they can afford to – this gives more people the chance to go to university and get on in life, but also means many students will never fully pay back their loans.“The government has been completely clear about why the face value of the loans was higher than the sale proceeds and, as the report notes, these were older loans so many borrowers had already repaid in full by the time of the sale,” the spokesperson said.The report accused the Treasury of being narrowly focused on lowering its key public sector net debt (PSND) figure. “However, PSND provides a narrow view of debt, as it does not take account of the potential income government would receive from student loan repayments. We estimate a net loss of future receipts from student loan repayments as a result of the sale of around £604m,” the NAO concluded.The NAO’s report on the sale of the loans follows a warning this week by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that said the government was underestimating the costs of funding higher education through its system of income-contingent student loans.An announcement by the Office for National Statistics that it was looking at changing the way student loans were accounted for could raise government borrowing estimates by about £15bn a year, according to the OBR.The total value of student loans in England stands at more than £100bn and is expected to rise to more than £470bn at present value by 2049."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb42a056fca94a004d5dd53b86fe6a0f6cf9e0b0/432_349_3201_1921/master/3201.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7c4c626d276618e71b818eee279d07c","title":"brad pitt matt damon leonardo dicaprio turned down brokeback mountain gus van sant","story":"Original director Gus Van Sant has revealed that multiple A-listers turned down the chance to star in the gay romanceLeonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Ryan Phillippe were among the actors who turned down roles in Brokeback Mountain, the gay romance that catapulted Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal to stardom. Gus Van Sant, the director who has frequently collaborated with Damon, revealed in an interview with IndieWire that the film – about two two men hired to herd sheep in Wyoming – proved strikingly challenging to cast. “Nobody wanted to do it,” said Van Sant. “I was working on it, and I felt like we needed a really strong cast, like a famous cast. That wasn’t working out. I asked the usual suspects: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Ryan Phillippe. They all said no.”Ledger eventually played Ennis, an introverted farmhand, opposite Gyllenhaal’s Twist, the more open of the pair, who continue their affair sporadically over 20 years. It was based on a short story by the writer Annie Proulx.Van Sant worked on the film before Ang Lee took over. It won the best director Oscar, one of three Academy awards the film took home in 2006, although it was controversially beaten to best picture by Paul Haggis’s Crash. Both Ledger, who died in 2008, and Gyllenhaal were nominated for best actor, and their work on the film earned them enduring respect and acclaim. The career of neither actor was felt to be remotely impaired by taking on gay roles. Van Sant was speaking to promote Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot, which stars Joaquin Phoenix and is widely perceived to be a return to form, following the disappointing Sea of Trees.

The sites will be “supported by operations staff in Riyadh and Dubai”.The websites will be owned and operated by SRMG, a publishing business whose chairman was until recently Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud. He left last month to take up a position as Saudi minister of culture. Prince Bader hit the headlines at the end of last year when he paid a record $450m for a Leonardo da Vinci painting of Jesus Christ, allegedly as a proxy bidder for Saudi’s new Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Although the international expansion was only announced this week, the web addresses for the new foreign-language Independent websites – independentarabia, independenturdu, independentturkish and independentpersian – were registered last November, suggesting the proposals had been in the works for some time.The Independent, which has been an online-only publication since closing its print edition in 2016, said the expansion would bring the “highest-quality, free-thinking, independent news, insight and analysis on global affairs and local events” to new audiences.However, questions will be raised about the journalistic decision to partner with a publisher with strong links to the Saudi government.Reporters Without Borders rates Saudi Arabia at 169 out of 180 countries on its World Press Freedom Index. It said the country had “no independent media” and the “level of self-censorship is extremely high”.“Despite his talk of reform, the young Mohammad bin Salman’s appointment as crown prince in June 2017 has had no positive impact on the freedom to inform,” the organisation said in its annual round-up on media freedom.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have been involved in a web of geopolitical alliances, rivalries and hostilities, with the battle increasingly involving attempts to influence press coverage and dominate social media.The decision to launch a Persian-language version of the Independent, staffed by SRMG journalists, would come under particular scrutiny given the Saudi state’s hostility to Iran, with both countries backing rival sides in the ongoing war in Yemen.The Independent is not the first media company from the west to partner with SRMG. Last year Bloomberg signed a deal to produce an Arabic-language version of financial news service.The Independent’s parent company, which is controlled by Russian oligarch’s son Evgeny Lebedev, grew its operating profit to £3.2m in 2017, according to recent accounts. However, the Evening Standard – Lebedev’s other news outlet – slumped to a £10m loss.The Independent said all editorial practices and output of the new sites would conform to the “world-renowned” standards, code of conduct and established ethos of the existing English-language publication."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88eed39878b03d4447e8d099ae28b3f6125827a/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90affbf0edb256cee7ad7a4878fe2fcf","title":"why drake fell in love with the uk and vice versa","story":"The rapper fell for Britain after a UK tour that saw him buying Winnie-the-Pooh books. And, by unselfishly giving a global platform to British artists, he has found that respect returned‘You know I’ve applied for your passport, right?” the British DJ Charlie Sloth says to Drake after the rapper’s Fire in the Booth freestyle verse on BBC Radio 1Xtra – the joke being that the Canadian is over in the UK so much, and aligns himself with its music culture so strongly, that he might as well move here permanently.For Fire in the Booth, MCs deliver long-form, often withering verses, free of the demands of song structure. And while Drake’s entry may not have the political ferocity of Akala’s, the determination of Wretch 32’s, or the spectacular endurance of Kano’s, he acquits himself well. His take may seem flat and incantatory to some, it is riveting when he spills over bar ides.It followed another UK freestyle he delivered this month for the online channel Link Up TV. Over a light and ghostly drill beat, Drake dipped into UK slang such as “paigon” and “road” with a flow that nodded to London rappers such as Headie One and Skengdo, and an accent that veered between Jamaica, Brixton and his native Canada. Some listeners cringed: there’s a slight air of a trendy youth worker or, worse, a racist impersonator.But like his Fire in the Booth, the freestyle became a sensation and Drake got away with that accent – his mixed-race heritage and background in cosmopolitan, West Indian-influenced Toronto means he can borrow from across cultures more authentically than other artists. “That’s how he talks – when you’re out with him … he’s saying ‘me and the mandem’,” Sloth tells me. “It’s not an act, it’s not Drake trying to fit in.”More importantly, the two freestyles come off the back of years of British patronage. His 2010 debut album was American through and through, but after a UK tour that saw him watch Chelsea, eat at the Wolseley, and – very Drake, this – buy first editions of Charlotte’s Web and Winnie-the-Pooh, he started working with the Londoners Jamie xx for his second album, Take Care (2011). Another emotive neo-balladeer, Sampha, from south London, was featured on his third album, Nothing Was the Same (2013), along with the Scottish producer Hudson Mohawke.At around the same time, Drake also started getting into British rap, naming the grime originator Wiley when asked about his favourite MCs, and then quoting the Tottenham MC Skepta on a track with Lil Wayne. His Instagram briefly became a digital shrine to grime rap battles, humbly saying the clash between Skepta and Devilman was “a true reminder that, whenever you think you’re good at what you do, there’s most likely two people out there that will yam your food”.Drake has since taken the energy of these relatively small-scale spats and turned then into blockbuster sparring – his recent tete-a-tetes with Meek Mill and Pusha T have been two of the most acid and discussed beefs in hip-hop history. Skepta took credit in 2015: “That’s a real London, grime attitude to have. It’s good, it’s battle rapping … I definitely think that my vibe has rubbed off on Drake a bit.” For his part, Skepta opened up his track Shutdown with a Drake sample, and the pair got tattoos of each other’s crew symbols and joined forces for a track with the Nigerian pop star Wizkid.Drake’s patronage started moving beyond grime into London’s road rap scene, hopping on stage with Section Boyz in 2016 for his own track Jumpman in a seamless segue. US hip-hop was always a component of grime’s syntax, but this performance underlined how blended both cultures had become, each with digital access to an entire world of rap as well as the styles on their respective doorsteps.In 2017, alongside the Midlands soul singer Jorja Smith, Drake worked with the south London rapper Giggs on two tracks for More Life. One, KMT, became a moshpit anthem in the UK but was decried by DJ Akademiks in the US as “other people’s musical culture infiltrating, and kinda almost being forced upon US hip-hop culture” – a view that underlines how progressive Drake’s approach is in the context of a US rap scene that has long ignored the UK. “Unselfishly, he has provided a platform for British artists to excel,” Sloth says.Drake has talked of his phone filling up with +44 codes on a remix for the young south London rapper Dave, while his wardrobe filled up with British “roadman” staple Stone Island. And he became such a fan of the black British drama Top Boy that he bought the rights. A series revival is coming up in 2019. As his Link Up freestyle shows, he has kept up to date with the recent drill sound, too, also namechecking Loski in an Instagram story hymning the influences on his new album Scorpion. “Drill is a genre that has had so much negative press, so to have the biggest superstar on the planet tip his hat to that art form … everyone was grateful,” Sloth says.Some of Drake’s moves are canny, even cynical, but he clearly has a deep engagement with British culture, and it has been reciprocated: his latest pop track, In My Feelings, is likely to hit No 1 in the UK this week. But by also being an outsider in today’s radically porous and permissive London music scene, he has shown that anyone – through sheer respect and skill – can ascend to the top of it, even a Canadian who sounds as if he is from Camberwell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7703772a135a052d6c48e76d27a957207816874/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ee47737c830d15c4dec4a0e09c253a","title":"how to spend it the shopping list for the 1 percent","story":"In an age of astonishing wealth, nothing reveals the lives of the ultra-rich like the FT’s unashamedly ostentatious luxury magazine. On 7 October 1967, the Financial Times, then the most buttoned-up newspaper in Britain and quite possibly the world, discreetly added a regular new page to its Saturday edition. Buried deep inside the paper, behind the usual thicket of articles about share prices and companies and pensions, the page was introduced to readers a little euphemistically, as “a guide to good living”. In small letters across the top of the page, the FT spelled out what “good living” meant. The page was called How to Spend It.In the still slightly austere postwar Britain of 1967, where the great majority of the FT’s prosperous readership of 150,000 lived, spending opportunities were limited. The new, monochrome page had an article about installing home central heating, then a relative luxury about a new electric coffee maker and about how to select and cook a pheasant: “Choose carefully. Hens are always best.” The most expansive piece was on an old-fashioned Scottish hotel owned by state-run British Rail. “The visitor is received with all the ceremony of an arrival at a country house,” wrote the reviewer. “You go into the immense hall and no one takes any notice.”The original one-page section has swelled into a thick, lustrous, large-format magazine, almost the size of a tabloid newspaper, which now appears 34 times a year, distributed with the FT across the world on Fridays and weekends. There is also an elaborate website, updated daily – and, unlike the FT’s main website, presented without a paywall. Under consumer capitalism, you are what you buy – or would like to buy. But the rich are different from everyone else in their consumption, because they can afford almost anything. Their challenge is choosing. The key role in this process played over decades by How to Spend It has made it an almost unique social lens, through which we can see how much the world has polarised since the egalitarian 1960s and 70s.Together, the magazine and website form “an elegant luxury environment for readers and advertisers”, as the FT’s promotional material puts it. At How to Spend It, “the world’s most desirable audience, with the largest purchasing power and highest net worth” is – in theory at least – judiciously steered by expert FT journalists towards the correct purchasing decisions. The magazine usually has between 80 and 100 pages. About half of them are advertisements, for the biggest global luxury brands and for more singular commodities, such as art and property. The other pages are a gleaming parade of articles – not always easy to tell from the ads – about the most expensive fashion, travel, food, interior design and other consumer goods imaginable.A long recent feature suggests “a sumptuous gastronomic tour of Spain by private jet”, three days long “from £6,995 per person”. An artfully casual page of recommended “knick-knackery” includes a “Chaumet Liens Lumière Watch in gold with diamonds and mother-of-pearl on alligator strap”, costing £12,870. A 2012 article on home furnishings with an aeronautical theme included a decommissioned Sky Flash air-to-air missile, polished to a perfect sheen and mounted on a pedestal: “This could be sitting in your drawing room for a mere £29,500.” To read How to Spend It, depending on your income level and attitude to extravagance, is to enter a world that is seductive or ridiculous, escapist or intimidating, a voyeuristic thrill or utterly enraging – and possibly all at the same time.Most consumer journalism draws readers to products within, or just beyond, their financial reach. But How to Spend It “is not aspirational”, says Qing Wang, a professor at Warwick Business School and an authority on the consumption habits of the very wealthy. “It’s for those who’ve made it, for the exclusive enjoyment of them and their kind.” Not all How to Spend It readers are rich, but a lot of them are. According to the FT, “Half have or would consider paying $14,000+ on a high-end watch” and “1 in 5 have or would consider using the service of a private jet”.Wang says: “How to Spend It can be sophisticated, but in the end, it’s all about status. Many of its readers are bankers, or businessmen from China and India – quite blunt people. They like the magazine’s directness. They pick it up thinking: ‘Just tell me what I need.’”“The magazine has a great conversion rate for advertisers,” or turning ads into sales, says Alice Pickthall of the media research firm Enders Analysis. A former FT journalist says: “Some readers take How to Spend It into a shop, point at a picture in it, and say: ‘I want that watch.’ It’s the Argos catalogue for rich people.”The consumption habits of this elite matter increasingly to all of us the spending decisions of the rich are now economic and social forces of enormous power. “As the rich have been getting progressively richer,” an analysis by the US investment bank Citigroup found in 2005, they have been “saving less and spending more”. Unlike other consumers, the report went on, the rich find many products, such as designer clothes, more desirable the more expensive they become. The countries where the rich congregate, such as Britain, Canada and the US, have been changed radically by this frenzy of spending: they have become “Plutonomies – economies powered by the wealthy”.Another sign of a plutonomy is that more and more high-profile institutions – universities, museums, media organisations – are dependent on the wealthy for funding or subsidy. Today’s FT is more cosmopolitan and influential than when it produced its first How to Spend It page in 1967. It is one of the most prestigious and important newspapers in the world. Less than a third of its 900,000 subscribers now live in the UK and as well as authoritative business reporting, it is increasingly known for its urbane tone and its investigations – notably in recent months about sexual harassment at the Houses of Parliament and the (now disbanded) Presidents Club in London, and about alleged bullying at the British advertising giant WPP.Yet the FT is also a less secure paper than it was half a century ago, with print media in decline and the advertising revenues from online journalism uncertain. In 2015, the paper was sold for £844m by its owners since 1957, Pearson, to the Japanese media company Nikkei. In 2016, the latest year for which accounts are available, the FT as a whole made a pre-tax profit of £6.2m on revenues of £311m: a substantial success for a traditional media brand, but a thin profit margin by corporate standards.Nobody outside the FT knows exactly how much of that revenue comes from the advertisements in How to Spend It. Like other papers, the FT does not release financial results for inidual supplements. But periodically there are proud hints from the FT’s management. In 2001, the then editor Andrew Gowers said the magazine had been “profitable from the first issue”. In 2007, the FT’s current chief executive John Ridding described How to Spend It as “a fantastic franchise”. Julia Carrick, who conceived the How to Spend It magazine and was its publisher until 2015, told me: “Some of the issues were way over £1m in profit.” At its current publication rate, a conservative estimate of How to Spend It’s annual profits would be above £10m.At a recent meeting of FT executives, convened to discuss the long-term future of the paper, the current editor, Lionel Barber, reportedly declared: “What we need is another How to Spend It.” Among senior FT management, a piece of melodramatic business jargon is sometimes used to describe the importance of How to Spend It and its editor since 1998, Gillian de Bono, to the FT’s continued existence. They are said to be “mission-critical”.How to Spend It and its readers usually radiate confidence. But its pages also inadvertently reveal that the rich have anxieties. Unlike in many other luxury magazines, almost everything covered is extremely expensive. Most products have the same kind of satiny, unblemished finish, both showy and perfectionist. Interiors are invariably neat. Interviewees are immaculate in their dress and speech. Everything is under control. Only rarely and awkwardly are references made to relevant but unsettling events outside this carefully curated world. “Post-protracted recession, repression and years of general national malaise, Zimbabwe,” an article announced in May, “is now one of the most exciting places to safari on the African continent.” As one of the magazine’s staff puts it, “Gillian gives readers permission to be rich and not feel guilty.” (This escapist approach may have attracted at least one infamous reader: in 2011, a reportedly “well-thumbed” copy of How to Spend It was found in a compound belonging to the besieged Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.)Yet while it reinforces the rich’s sense of entitlement – their sense that the world is their playground – How to Spend It also serves to remind them that they frequently lack taste. With striking bluntness, the magazine’s name says as much. “Compared with the truly fashionable, who are often less well-off, and have acquired their edge by having to choose between products,” says a prominent British writer on class and style, “seriously rich people are often ever so slightly behind the beat.”In an age of mass luxury – of mobbed designer concessions in department stores, of designer shops proliferating in seemingly every major city – how can the rich stand out? How to Spend It often advises its readers to buy limited-edition or hand-made goods. But sometimes the discernment required seems never-ending. In an issue in May, the British designer of upper-class menswear Jeremy Hackett recommended a London shoemaker, George Cleverley, whose bespoke products cost “from £3,600”. “My current order,” said Hackett, “is for some tan and white Oxfords … made from a batch of reindeer leather salvaged from the Metta Catharina – a 53-ton brigantine that sank off the southern coast of England during a voyage from St Petersburg to Genoa in 1786. The leather was tanned in St Petersburg by artisans whose techniques were secret for centuries … ” Hackett might have been joking – except that How to Spend It doesn’t do jokes.There are rarely any people in its formal, crystalline photos of palatial hotels and homes, as if readers need to have these places to themselves, as sanctuaries from the rest of the world. “How to Spend It sells a kind of tranquility – a promise that luxurious products and experiences will have a restorative effect,” Qing Wang says. “That’s what many of its readers need.”Unlike the wealthy of previous gilded ages, most of today’s rich have made their own money. Many are workaholics. “They are time-poor. They want instant satisfaction – and they also want relaxation,” adds Wang. It has been the lucrative but strenuous task of How to Spend It to fulfil these contradictory needs.How to Spend It began as a more carefree enterprise: the product of a reader’s letter and an extramarital affair. In 1958, Sheila Black, a clever former actor who was married to a tabloid editor, wrote to the then editor of the FT, the famously staid Sir Gordon Newton, to complain that his business newspaper rarely actually wrote about consumer goods. Newton responded by hiring her. She became the FT’s first female journalist, first consumer reporter, and Newton’s lover.The FT can be a conservative place, and it took nine years for Black’s work to be formalised as the How to Spend It page. She and a tiny staff were given their own office, to which Newton “would go in the evening to share a gin and tonic with Black,” her FT obituary recorded after she died in 2007. “Other staff usually took the hint and left.”Newton retired in 1972, and Black left the paper with him. For the next decade and a half, How to Spend It remained a minor part of the FT, a double-page spread at best, with breezy articles about women’s sandals, or collecting carved wooden birds sometimes it was part of a section in the paper a little patronisingly called Diversions. A puritanism lingered among the paper’s readers, and some of them objected to the name How to Spend It. In 1982, with Britain emerging unsteadily from a deep recession, one wrote to complain that the name was “inapposite to our time, vulgar and an affront”.“I sat there shaking in my shoes at the criticism,” recalled Black’s successor as How to Spend It editor, Lucia van der Post. “But I decided to publish the letter on my pages, and let the readers decide about the name, with the best response winning a case of champagne.”The section kept its name. During the mid-80s, it began to cover more luxurious products. But it did so with a degree of irony and caution. A 1985 piece about designer sunglasses reassured readers that they were “no longer just for Mafia bosses” but “an acceptable accoutrement for gentlemen”. A 1990 piece described vintage grand pianos as “a reasonable investment”. Van der Post was the daughter of the explorer and conservationist Laurens van der Post, best known for celebrating the ascetic lives of African Bushmen. The contrast between his and her attitudes to possessions seemed striking – the shift to a more materialistic world in a single family. But she wrote with infectious enthusiasm about “whatever interested me”, she told me, and she acquired a cult readership.Demand for prestige goods grew, and their prices rose sharply. Since 1982, the American business magazine Forbes has been tracking the cost of the same 40 “ultraluxe items”, such as caviar and tennis courts, to create what it calls a “Cost of Living Extremely Well Index”. This index has risen almost twice as fast as the cost of consumer goods overall.The person who has made it so since, more than anyone else, is Gillian de Bono. She joined the FT in 1994, to help Van der Post, who was not an experienced editor, run How to Spend It. De Bono was in her early 40s, and had already edited women’s magazines and the consumer journal Which? It was a populist rather than elite CV, but she had a reputation for limitless energy and fastidiousness. In 1998, Van der Post returned to full-time writing, and De Bono succeeded her as editor.One of its most fascinating but brazen regular items is a close look at the consumer desires of an inidual, titled “the Aesthete”. As its name suggests, the page is meant to be more about taste than price – a chance to show connoisseurship. But rich people and costly products predominate. In 2012, with Britain enduring the austerity policies of George Osborne, the page featured the Conservative chancellor’s father, Sir Peter Osborne. He revealed that he had his eye on a “wonderful” desk costing £19,000, and had recently been “lent a villa by an Italian friend” on the exclusive Caribbean island of Mustique.Like many of the rich themselves, the pages of How to Spend It have spent the turbulent decade since the financial crisis in a state of comfortable equilibrium, at the very least. “The design hasn’t changed for 10 years,” says a former staff member. The articles still unfurl in wide, stately columns the enormous photos of products are still precisely arranged and white-bordered, as if for an unusually elegant catalogue. The few pictures of people are usually of artisan producers, characterfully lined and smiling, like trusty retainers on an idealised country estate.In some ways, this conservatism is precisely what makes How to Spend It appealing to an itinerant international readership whose working lives are often in flux. The same goes for its association with the steady, respectable FT, and with a certain version of England – as a place to buy a handmade shotgun or a well-cut suit. London in particular has presented itself very effectively since the 90s as a civilised, slightly retro pleasure ground for the global rich, and How to Spend It has helped burnish that myth.If there is a How to Spend It ethos, De Bono has come to see herself as its  during her 20-year editorship. If she is presented with work she considers inadequate or unsuitable, she will say: “This is not How to Spend It. It’s not how we do it.”A small, formal woman in her mid-60s with a perfect bobbed haircut, De Bono rarely stops working. In 2014, she told the website Politico that organising the 20th anniversary issue, in which every product mentioned was eventually auctioned for charity, “consumed me day and night for nine months”. Carrick said: “She’s incredibly hard-working.” A staff member said: “When Gillian goes on holiday, she looks at every single page proof on her sun lounger, on a laptop, and then phones in changes.”The How to Spend It offices feel a little separate from the rest of the FT building in central London. The rest of the floor is open-plan, but How to Spend It’s space – a couple of dozen desks, and a corner office for De Bono – is behind a glass wall. The atmosphere is quiet and reverent: trophies won by the magazine and website stand prominently on a cabinet. The staff are mostly experienced journalists, men and women of varying ages, who work long days according to a weekly production rhythm that has been strictly maintained for years. A few are embarrassed by some of the material they process. “A 3,000-word piece on perfume – who’s reading that?” one asks rhetorically. But in the office they keep such thoughts to themselves. “Mind your own business, and do what you’re told – that’s the culture,” says another.Serving the rich is usually not for the faint-hearted. The industries that cater to their elaborate tastes are often very exacting and top-down: the rich expect the best, and are not squeamish about hierarchies. Luxury magazines are no exception, and staff at How to Spend It have often worked for others. But complaints about How to Spend It’s working culture have recently provoked a crisis at one of the FT’s most profitable assets.Last November, 18 of How to Spend It’s current and former staff filed a formal complaint under the FT’s whistleblower procedure, which permits serious allegations against managers to be submitted anonymously. As a result, the paper launched an internal inquiry into allegations of bullying against De Bono, going back more than a decade. The FT’s human resources department collected testimony from employees (some of whom now work on other sections of the FT), and compiled a dossier more than 40 pages long.Seven months later, on 7 June, the inquiry finally reported. Its findings were not made public. According to a summary of the report written by the FT’s director of HR, the inquiry described De Bono’s “management style” as sometimes “erratic and, at its worst, didactic, high-handed and … (by her own admission) impatient”. It said there was “a perception within the team that certain iniduals are being ‘targeted’” by De Bono. But it found that there was “not sufficient evidence of a history of harassment and bullying,” and cited “examples of Gillian evincing great thoughtfulness, understanding and empathy with iniduals in her team, even among those who accuse her.” The “inidual complaints” against her, the summary concluded, “have not been upheld.”This verdict has not satisfied many of those who took part in the inquiry. They feel that it was not sufficiently independent or thorough, and that the paper is protecting one of its editorial stars. “People at How to Spend It are angry,” says one. The National Union of Journalists is backing the complainants. On 20 June, its large chapel at the FT passed a motion criticising the inquiry and promising “to support the whistleblowers should they decide to take further action”.Over recent months, I have spoken at length to current and former How to Spend It staff. None of them have wanted to be named, or to have their complaints reported in any detail, for fear of being identified – luxury journalism is a small world. But their complaints are raw. One of them told me: “With Gillian, It’s always verbal. Sometimes, she does it one-on-one in her office, with the door shut. Sometimes, she explodes at you in front of everyone.”De Bono and Barber declined to be interviewed for this article. But an FT spokesperson said: “We can confirm that complaints about the management of How to Spend It were lodged last year. These were fully investigated in a rigorous, professional internal process. The complaints were not upheld. We are, however, actively looking at ways to better support the magazine’s continued rapid growth.”A senior FT source was franker: “We’re trying to bring the culture of How to Spend It closer to the rest of the paper … to improve its employee relations. Gillian is a tough cookie the damn thing wouldn’t work unless she was. But she is not the easiest person.”The magazine and its editor are still “mission-critical” to the FT. On 7 June, it was Barber who presented the inquiry’s conclusions to the How to Spend It staff. “Lionel marched into the How to Spend It offices,” says an FT staff member, “stood right beside Gillian, and said: ‘You work for a great magazine. Gillian is a world-class editor. But it has been a difficult time for everyone. We’re going to implement changes. And then we want to draw a line.’ He then asked for questions, but there was a stony silence.”In an age of fragmenting media, there is something old-fashioned about a single publication telling the rich how to live. Over the past dozen years, other newspapers have tried to copy the How to Spend It formula. Rival magazines and websites such as the Times’s Luxx and the Daily ’s Luxury have less clever names, but in content and format are not always easy to tell apart from the original. For now, there is enough advertising to go round: luxury magazines, being highly tactile, useful badges of status, and free of online clutter, are one of the few remaining boom areas in print media. But gauche millionaires seeking advice on shirtmakers can now shop around.In 2017, a regular survey of the luxury goods market by the management consultants Bain concluded that a “millennial state of mind” was “changing purchasing habits”, forcing companies to focus more on products that were simultaneously upmarket and downmarket, such as deliberately trashy-looking designer trainers. How to Spend It does have articles about trainers, but it prefers to write about shoes that send more reliable signals about wealth, like brogues.How to Spend It also occasionally features affordable, seemingly everyday products. In the latest issue, the Danish designer Øivind Slaatto recommends a Copenhagen restaurant for its porridge. But the need to impress is always lurking in the background. The restaurant owner, Slaatto points out, “has become a kind of rock star – he does porridge demonstrations at music festivals”. How to Spend It never stops being aware of status and nor, it implies, should its readers. For all the leisure it depicts, How to Spend It makes being rich seem hard work.In recent years, one of the places it has recommended repeatedly as a shopping destination is Mount Street in Mayfair. Once a backwater of offices and antique shops, the street has been transformed since the mid-2000s into a canyon of forbiddingly exclusive boutiques, selling designer clothes and leather goods. Staff unlock doors to let you in, then follow you solicitously but watchfully round the creamy interiors, which are a little like bank vaults, often partly subterranean and much bigger than they appear from the street.Inside the boutiques, the rest of the world recedes. There are rarely many other customers just staff waiting patiently to serve you, and walls of soft, flawless products. Mount Street is a perfect microcosm of the exquisite, sometimes airless, increasingly separate world that How to Spend It has helped construct for the rich since the 60s.But this sort of experience may no longer be what the rich desire most. An even more significant indicator of what separates them from the rest of us can be found in The Sum of Small Things, a rare clear-eyed book about the rich, published last year by Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, an American academic who studies the west’s wealthiest cities. In recent years, she argues, the rich have begun to “spend significantly less on conspicuous consumption and more on inconspicuous consumption”, such as “education, healthcare, pensions, and personal insurance”. They are buying the security and long-term elite status that are more valuable, in perilous times, than escape or pleasure.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37543db4d1e699b53e10bed23074ca9031abc522/272_331_4667_2800/master/4667.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d432d381bffb7bb2473c9d4fad4785c","title":"enter dominic raab a veritable chip off the old brexit block","story":"The new Brexit secretary is showing every sign of being as clueless as his predecessor There is no sincerer form of flattery. It had been expected that the appointment of Dominic Raab to replace David Davis as Brexit secretary might raise the average IQ of the department by a few dozen points. After all, even appointing my dog – one of the dimmer creatures on this planet – would have been an improvement. But these hopes have been quickly dashed. Either there is something about the Brexit department that renders all ministers who work for it catatonically stupid or Raab is determined to live down to the standards of his predecessor. An act of kindness.What Raab does have, however, that Davis doesn’t, is a limited amount of self-awareness. He realises that the whole purpose of his job is that it’s entirely cosmetic. He’s not there to actually do anything. He’s there to give the impression that he’s doing something. The Brexit negotiations are far too complex to be left to any of the halfwits in the Brexit department. They’re also way too tricky for the prime minister and the civil service, but it’s they who are calling the shots and Raab’s main function is to do the photocopying and make the tea. Jobs he can just about manage. At his first departmental questions, Raab immediately set about proving his lack of credentials by declaring he was very much looking forward to Michel Barnier offering “his full support” for the Chequers white paper when they met later in the day. A curious reading of the situation, given that the other EU countries have been openly sniggering about the white paper’s faults for much of the past few days and were under the impression they were currently still negotiating the withdrawal agreement. Raab hadn’t got to where he had today by knowing what he was doing. Or what was going on. The ghost of Davis past.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, felt obliged to try a couple of questions on the viability of the Chequers agreement but he, too, was sweet-talked with meaningless circular arguments that went nowhere. A world of magical realism where everything could be simultaneously exactly the same and entirely different. Here and not here. Where there would be a Brexit idend even if the country was worse off because being worse off was a price worth paying for taking back control. It wasn’t just Labour that was getting fobbed off. Several of the hardcore Tory Eurosceptics were keen to make sure ministers were making detailed plans for their preferred no-deal Brexit. Absolutely, Raab insisted. The department had started thinking about it very hard a few days previously and had already come up with some nicely coloured wall charts he hoped would be made available to the public at some point in the future when it would all be a bit late. But it would still all be fine even if it wasn’t. At this point, Steve Baker, the former junior Brexit minister who had been Private Walker to Davis’s Captain Mainwaring and is now a self-appointed cheerleader for Boris Johnson, intervened to ask if his one-page masterplan – MY MASTERPLAN by S. BAKER. 1. Tell the EU to sod off. 2. Take back control 3. So there. 4. Panic – could be widely distributed around the department. Are you sure? Raab said. Wouldn’t it be less embarrassing if it was quietly fed through the shredder?  Baker wasn’t satisfied. It’s not enough for him to be thought an idiot. He won’t rest until he’s proved it. So he carried on, demanding also that the minister appoint a tame economist to rubbish the HMRC report that warned even a soft Brexit would cost the country jobs and money. Raab said nothing. It didn’t feel the time to point out Brexit had already cost Baker his job and there was every chance it would claim those of several more ministers. The sooner the better. For their sake as well as the country’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3519e95fb34c08c9f69c7b36ba4af4cfe5941e79/0_102_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=758faeaf480f7b5ed3f73f878d619cf0","title":"the brexiters strike back politics weekly podcast","story":"Heather Stewart is joined by Jessica Elgot, Katy Balls and Jonathan Lis to discuss another febrile week of Brexit parliamentary standoffs.

But in the meantime if something comes about I’ll be happy.”Bayliss has said chief selector Ed Smith, who picked Jos Buttler based purely on white-ball form for the first Test series of the summer against Pakistan, is likely to have a conversation with Rashid to gauge his appetite for a return – potentially for the first Test at Edgbaston starting on 1 August.“That’s a decision Adil’s got to make,” said Bayliss. “I’m not sure whether Ed Smith’s had a chat with him or not. Could he get picked in the Test team on white-ball form? It’s already happened once this year. I’m sure he’ll be up for discussion, definitely.“This year is probably the best we’ve seen him bowl. His control and his consistency has been top class.”Bayliss confirmed Ben Stokes will play in the first Test against India despite fears he could be distracted by his impending court case.The all-rounder will miss the second match of the series at Lord’s as it clashes with his trial at Bristol Crown Court on a charge of affray.Given the scheduled conclusion of the Edgbaston Test is just a day before the trial starts it would be understandable if England decided to overlook Stokes.However, Bayliss said: “Ben’s the all-round package and just lifts everyone. Look, it’s not the best situation not having him there for Lord’s but we want him available for as many games as possible.”* Does not include Cricket World Cup fixturesMeanwhile, England have confirmed a schedule for next summer that includes an historic four-day first Test against Ireland.The four-day contest at Lord’s, starting on 24 July, will be England’s first Test scheduled to last fewer than five days since 1971.Ireland, who gained Test status last year and lost their first match against Pakistan in May, will act as an Ashes warm-up for England.That series against Australia, the first to be played as part of the new ICC Test Championship, will start at Edgbaston on 1 August, with further Tests at Lord’s, Headingley, Old Trafford and The Oval."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f6c18c13c26d218062702485245bf64181e9fd7/0_78_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7072c1ba6724d84f65f6ba7e80791445","title":"laura muir interview scottish runner athletics","story":"The Scottish runner has caused a stir in athletics by repeatedly calling for tougher drug testing but is not tempted to stay quiet“Twenty-six seconds! 27, 28, 29!” On this Monday afternoon in St Moritz, 6,000 feet up in the Swiss Alps, it is not only the Instagram-perfect views or the altitude that rips the breath away. Watching Laura Muir grind out multiple sets of 200 metres in under 30 seconds, with only half a minute to recover and refill her lungs, has a similar hypoxic effect. Finally after the 10th repetition her coach, Andy Young – part speaking clock, part drill sergeant during the session – calls time. Muir barely notices. Her head is slumped somewhere between her knees, trying to suck up the thin mountain air.Such sessions are part of Muir’s plan to peak for the European Athletics Championships next month in Berlin, where she hopes to double up in the 800m and 1500m and lay down a hefty marker for the world championships next year and the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.With Mo Farah having moved to the marathon, Muir is at the vanguard of the next wave of young British track talent crashing through. Certainly her range is extraordinary. During the past two years alone she has set a number of British and European records at distances ranging from 1,000m to 5,000m while her medal cabinet is steadily expanding. But there is something else that stands out about Muir: she speaks out.After the 1500m final at the Rio Olympics, won by Genzebe Dibaba, she admitted to having “doubts” about whether the result could be trusted. At the world indoors in March she said she no longer talks to Dibaba because of the Ethiopian’s links to Jama Aden, who is under investigation for drugs offences. Both Dibaba and Aden have denied committing any doping violations.Is she ever tempted to bite her tongue? “I think I would have a lot easier life if I didn’t say stuff,” she says, with a wry smile. “But, at the same time, people might not understand what is going on. I am honest, so I say what I feel – within limits.”Muir, who has repeatedly called for more testing in her sport, admits to receiving some abuse following her comments about Dibaba. “There was a bit. You would have to expect that. I was asked a question and I gave the answer.”And she nods when Young calls for more uniformity of testing around the world. “People should have no idea the testers are coming and the government should have no idea they are coming,” he says. “That should be the absolute basic for anyone and any country. And if the country can’t provide it, then it shouldn’t be in the sport. I don’t need to talk specifics but I am sure other people can look into which countries don’t provide that.”However, Team Muir are more reticent when discussing the brief hire of David McHenry, a strength and conditioning coach at the Nike Oregon Project – whose head coach, Alberto Salazar, is being examined by the US Anti-Doping Agency.But they insist they intended for McHenry, who is not under investigation, to help with only remote video coaching, and it is clear they were not prepared for the backlash. “Laura didn’t specifically need a strength coach,” says Young. “It was more that here was someone who was the best in the world and we were looking for that quarter of a tiny per cent of improvement. And there wasn’t a controversy around him.”Young, who was an excellent runner himself but has put on one or two pounds since retiring, says he may look for someone to fill the role, “although I was doing the S\u0026ampC before – and technically I have a weightlifting qualification.”At this point Muir starts to giggle. “What are you laughing at?” he asks. “Look, this belly wasn’t always there! I don’t have to lift it any more, I just give instructions.”For now Muir’s sole focus is on this weekend’s Anniversary Games in London, where she will attempt to break Zola Budd’s British one-mile record of 4min 17.57sec, which has stood for 33 years. “I am really happy with my season so far,” Muir says. “I ran 3.59 for 1500m in Eugene, which was my fastest ever season opener and that was coming off the back of exams and a bit of a cold, and then did a 1.59 800m and 3.58 for 1500m back to back, so hopefully I can run even faster in London.“If I could break the British record I’d be really happy but the field is looking pretty strong,” she says, pointing out that Sifan Hassan, Jenny Simpson, Hellen Obiri and Gudaf Tsegay could help her drive past Budd’s best but also deflate her chances of victory. Having finished her veterinary studies degree at the University of Glasgow, Muir expects that being a full-time athlete will push her to greater heights – even though she is not yet running any more miles. “When you are constantly studying, you do end up quite mentally drained,” she says. “With training you can get away with it – you know what splits you have to do, so you can just get on with it. But when it comes to racing you need to be really switched on. Physically I have always been in good shape but mentally I think I will just be that little bit fresher.” Muir celebrated completing her degree by visiting a Six Flags theme park in the United States and going on the scariest roller coasters back to back. “I like to go out and see things,” she says. “With Rome it was the Coliseum, with China it was the Great Wall, while we did Christ the Redeemer and Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio. You travel to all these amazing places so it would be a shame to just do track, race, airport, home. You’ve got to make the most of it. You’re travelling the world essentially for free and you want to take it in.”And, unsurprisingly, Muir is already firming up her plans to visit Tokyo in 2020 – even though she confesses she is not always comfortable being in the public eye. “When I was growing up I never aspired to be an Olympic champion because I thought it was a bit unrealistic for me, I guess,” she says. “But for any athlete it is the pinnacle of what you want to achieve. I’d certainly love an Olympic gold medal, and I’d take the press and attention that comes with it.”Muir will attempt to break the British one mile record on 22 July at the Muller Anniversary Games.

The British Horseracing Authority was left trying to explain why it had pursued the case when, according to the panel’s ruling, it has no jurisdiction over vets who live and work in Ireland.The three-person disciplinary panel issued a summary of its reasons on Thursday night and said “there were, on the evidence, a number of other realistic possibilities for the source of any such information”. The panel appears to have been impressed by Brennan, who gave evidence for about half a day and faced lengthy cross-examination, describing him as “a credible witness who did not seek to avoid any of the matters put to him”.The panel offered some little comfort to the BHA, saying it had acted “reasonably in instigating an inquiry in respect of Timothy Brennan”. Those words appear to leave open the question of whether it was reasonable, after that inquiry, to charge him and proceed to a full hearing.Joseph Fitzpatrick, Brennan’s solicitor, criticised the BHA for being slow to share vital information, particularly an internal email which revealed the Irish Turf Club had pointed investigators in the direction of an inidual other than Brennan. That was part of a cache of undisclosed material which Brennan’s lawyers were shown only on the morning of the hearing. The BHA’s barrister said during the hearing that Fitzpatrick would have been welcome to travel to London to inspect the file at any stage.“I’m over here in Kilkenny,” the solicitor said on Thursday night. “How am I going to get across there unless I get into a plane? And this is a file of 50 pages that could have been scanned and sent. But at least we got it on the morning and that helped in a very substantial way to vindicate my client’s position.”He added that the BHA should not have revealed the details of the hearing in a press release two months in advance. “They had no reason to do so except to garner as much publicity as they possibly could for these proceedings. That brought on an avalanche of comment and there are a number of media sources who indicated that our client was guilty.“The BHA is very polite in the way it conducts these matters but it twists the knife while it’s smiling at you. It could have avoided that press release and should have done so, in my opinion. That caused a lot of distress to the family.”No formal response to those points was offered by the BHA but a spokesman said advance publication of the charges in this case was in line with its usual practice. He issued a statement defending the regulator’s right to bring the case.“The BHA has a duty to protect the integrity of our sport and the interests of the betting public,” the statement said. “That means we will investigate and act where we become aware of suspicious betting activity. Those who lose money in such circumstances would expect nothing less and we owe it to them to pursue these cases.Tips by Chris Cook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8083817e4cb4b8d9fea5b941be9b203b582b48d6/0_167_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc3f94978544020fc28644e0eb1e4e90","title":"our shirley valentine summer review love island for celebrity fiftysomethings","story":"Eight women looking for love is all a bit genteel, except for the fabulous Nancy Dell’Olio who doles out drinks and tells it as it is“When I came to Greece, I knew it was going to be spiritual,” says comedian Ninia Benjamin. “I did not expect to be shaking my vagina.” But shake it for Our Shirley Valentine Summer (ITV), she does, along with seven other celebrity women who are single and ready to give their lives a sun-and-sea overhaul. ITV has carved out a kind of niche recently in sticking vintage celebrities into unusual situations and hoping for fireworks. They got Pat Butcher high on Gone to Pot, stripped Ainsley Harriot naked for The Real Full Monty, and sent Su Pollard to Sin City for Last Laugh in Vegas. It’s a Partridge-esque approach to commissioning, but the results have been oddly compelling, not least for offering viewers the unforgettable sight of a meal made with edible pot all getting a bit much for Christopher Biggins.It has been a while since I have seen Shirley Valentine, the film, but I am fairly certain that it isn’t quite the romcom that it is remembered to be when people talk about “doing a Shirley Valentine”. Helpfully, there are three disclaimers at the start of the show, stating clearly that it is only “inspired by” the story, that any similarities to the play or film are coincidental, and that it has not actually been licensed as an official Shirley Valentine product, if there could be such a thing. I think even Willy Russell might struggle to conjure dramatic intrigue out of Siân Lloyd admitting that she quite fancies her hill-walking instructor, or Melinda Messenger deciding that she is going to spend the month looking after chickens, so the group can have their own eggs.Still, that hasn’t prevented the makers from framing this as a kind of Love Island with compulsory sarongs. The eight participants are single, the voiceover reminds us every few minutes, and are spending a month on the Greek island of Naxos in the hope of finding love. Most have been married and are now orced. Whether it is admitting that not having children has been hard, or discussing the effects of an extra-marital affair, they all seem a little bruised by life. This is their chance to experience something that could dig them out of the rut they say they have found themselves in (specifically, for Annabel Giles, it is “a box set rut”). With the exception of Lizzie Cundy’s unquenchable thirst for “bad boys”, including a language teacher who looks as if he took a wrong turn at the Love Island auditions, it is all very nice and wholesome, for the most part. It is also a little genteel, a bit too pleasant to really rollick along. Perhaps it is time to send in the edibles.There is a big however, though, in the shape of Nancy Dell’Olio. For everyone else’s tentative niceness, Dell’Olio gives a strong impression that she does not need to be anywhere near Naxos, that it is simply an amusing ersion from her main occupation of being fabulous. She bats away the suggestion that wearing tottering heels on a hillside track is difficult, insisting instead that it is good exercise. When the others tell the story of their 50th birthdays, she confides that she took her friends to Puglia. “Closest friends?” “400 people,” she replies, coolly. She has a cocktail in the morning because she feels like it. Her ineffable confidence seems far more useful to the others than the slightly uncomfortable matchmaking setups, and particularly for Benjamin, who could do with a self-esteem boost. “You can’t stop a free spirit,” shrugs Dell’Olio, the fairy godmother of not-giving-a-hoot. Sadly, the trailer for the next episode teases that she might bring some friction to the house, which is a shame. I would much prefer her to glide through the month doling out drinks and real talk than becoming the villain of the piece. Surely there is enough poolside bickering over on ITV2.The vagina-shaking, by the way, is part of a spiritual class, in which some of the women spend their time sitting with a softly spoken, guru-ish woman who promises to help them “rediscover their sexuality” by imagining a snake roaming around their nether regions. It is worth seeing Our Shirley Valentine Summer for that, obviously, and for Dell’Olio, but the rest of it leaves the viewer with the feeling you get when you have agreed to look at somebody else’s holiday photos, only to find that there are 300 of them to get through."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4b901343c68cf053ed145ddd5dbfbc5f1e8a46a/1691_830_1809_1085/master/1809.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca198c00c4e6fb4812a68a1ea8e477f9","title":"scott pruitt formaldehyde report","story":"Staff organized for his new desk to be aired out in a warehouse for a week so as to reduce even the smallest chance of exposureStaff at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) organized for a new office desk to air out in a remote warehouse for a week so that former agency head Scott Pruitt wouldn’t have to breathe in any traces of the carcinogenic chemical formaldehyde from his furniture, emails obtained by Politico have revealed. At the same time, Pruitt was refusing to more strictly regulate the chemical, despite sitting on a report that said it’s putting Americans at risk of leukaemia and throat cancer.Last month it emerged key figures in the EPA were suppressing an agency report, completed just before Donald Trump took office, that found that a majority of Americans inhale unacceptably high levels of formaldehyde vapor in the course of daily life, which puts them at risk of developing cancer of the blood, throat and nose. According to Politico, a trade group representing the businesses that could face new regulations if the study were released had frequent access to EPA officials and successfully pressured them to refrain from publishing the report.Pruitt himself, however, was protected from inhaling the chemical. As part of the $9,500 refurbishing of his office – which had already caused controversy for surpassing the $5,000 limit set by Congress for redecoration costs – Pruitt ordered a new desk. When it emerged that it contained formaldehyde, aides sought advice about whether it would be safe for Pruitt.Deputy chief of staff Reginald Allen emailed Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, then serving as acting head of the EPA’s toxic chemicals office to ask for more information about formaldehyde safety. Cleland-Hamnett told him the desk was made in California, where formaldehyde is more stringently regulated, and was therefore likely to be fine – but to be sure they could air it out for a few days. According to emails obtained by American Oversight with a Freedom of Information request, and shared with Politico, plans were then made to have the desk assembled in a separate warehouse and left there for a week so as to ensure Pruitt’s safety.While EPA officials went to such lengths to ensure Pruitt’s safety, they have done nothing to regulate levels of formaldehyde, and continue to delay the report’s release. In states that don’t have specific regulations, it is still used in compressed wood, adhesives and other materials."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2df80def323bf39938699f49b2dc958a2d7177ce/0_94_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e31ca5b01b262b70f25baf2a413ac012","title":"three mummies egyptian black granite sarcophagus alexandria","story":"Archaeologists open granite tomb but are dismayed at state of decay after ‘sewage leak’Egyptian archeologists have opened a 30-tonne black granite sarcophagus to find three decomposed mummies after sewage water apparently leaked inside. “The sarcophagus has been opened, but we have not been hit by a curse,” said Mostafa Waziry, the head of Egypt’s Supreme Council for Antiquities, in response to news reports warning of maledictions hidden inside the tomb in the port city of Alexandria. Waziry, accompanied by a team of specialists in mummification and restoration, instead found three mummies and a red liquid he identified as sewage water, believed to have entered the sarcophagus through a crack on its right side, causing the decomposition of the mummies. The tomb was found buried five metres beneath the surface and the help of Egyptian military engineers was required to open the 15-tonne lid. After capturing the world’s attention because of its unusually large size, observers believed it could contain the remains of a prominent figure, with some considering the possibility that it could contain the corpse of Alexander the Great. The sarcophagus, almost three metres across and two metres high, is believed to date from the early Ptolemaic period, which began following the death of Alexander in 323BC.It was found during construction work in Egypt’s northernmost city, accompanied by a weathered alabaster head thought to depict one of the occupants of the tomb. Archeologists were excited because a layer of mortar beneath the lid suggested it had remained untouched since it was buried thousands of years ago. The skulls of the three mummies found inside will now be analysed in order to identify their ages and cause of death. Shaaban Abdel Amonem, one of the specialists in mummification who attended the opening, said initial assessments showed the trio were probably soldiers, with one of the skulls displaying evidence of arrow blows.  Waziri said the lack of death masks in precious metals, amulets, statuettes or inscriptions on the sarcophagus meant the bodies were unlikely to be those of Ptolemaic or Roman royals. Video footage from the news website Youm7 showed a man pouring the red liquid into the street, after samples were taken to be analysed.

Photograph: Getty ImagesA bird forced a plane bound for New York to circle over the coast near Bray before returning to Dublin Airport. Norwegian Airlines flight D81842 to New York reported a bird-strike during its take-off roll shortly after departing Dublin at approximately 8:36am.The plane then flew out over Galway before returning to the east coast, where it entered a holding pattern for around three hours in order to burn off fuel before attempting a landing. Siobhán O’Donnell, from Dublin Airport Authority, confirmed that the incident took place, and also confirmed that the plane landed safely at around 12:20pm. As a precaution, Airport Fire Services followed the plane until it had completed its landing. A Norwegian Airlines spokesperson said: “Today’s flight D81842 from Dublin to New York returned safely back to Dublin Airport following a suspected bird strike. The safety and security of our passengers and crew is our highest priority and passengers have disembarked the aircraft as normal”. Birds are a common risk to planes and have been known to cause accidents when collisions occur, although serious incidents only happen with larger birds. Of 21,380 occurrences reported between 2011 and 2014, bird strikes were the second most common reason, only behind system failures and malfunctions. Staff at Dublin Airport have tried numerous ways to keep birds away from the runways and reduce the number of bird strikes. These have included a fake fox on the runway, kites with pictures of birds of prey on them, and even a small gas cannon to frighten the birds with noise. These efforts may be paying off, as the 2016 Annual Safety Review of Aviation in Ireland did not list bird strikes in the top-three causes of reported incidents. In fact, 2016 only saw 56 bird strikes at the airport, down from around 70 the previous year. There was a slight rise in the numbers of strikes in 2017, up to 60. However, Ms. O’Donnell insisted that these numbers are very small when the amount of air traffic going through Dublin Airport was considered. “When you take it that we had 223,197 aircraft landings and take-offs last year so the number is small in the overall size of the planes landing and taking-off. “That said this is an area that we take very seriously and we invest a lot of time and effort in deterring birds from nesting and flying across the airfield”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3570370.1532014679!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cost to hse of recruiting 371 staff a month not sustainable","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe review  says that HSE estimates on expenditure on agency staff have been “consistently out of line” with actual spending. Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsCurrent levels of recruitment in the health service - running at 371 staff per month - are not sustainable when combined with the ongoing cost of pay deals and other health service pressures such as pharmaceuticals, a new Government spending review has found. The review also says that HSE estimates on expenditure on agency staff have been “consistently out of line” with actual spending ranging from €52 million to €154 million above the projected level from 2015 to 2017. It says it appears that assumptions underpinning agency pay profiles are “not realistic or achievable”. The review suggests that staffing levels for doctors and nurses is back beyond the levels in place in 2009 when calculated per 1,000 of population. The review says the number of personnel employed in the HSE across all grades increased by 14,213 whole time equivalents (WTE) or 15 per cent between the beginning of 2014 and the end of 2017. It says there has also been a substantial increase in recruitment in the early part of this year with 1,482 staff taken on or a monthly average of 371.However it says that the health budget for 2018 only provided for an additional 1,800 staff to be hired -- or around 150 WTEs per month. “If this recruitment rate continues for the remainder of 2018 and 2019, it is expected that this would add €235million to the pay bill in 2018 and €250million in 2019. This would result in an increase in direct pay spend of €485million by end 2019. Going forward, this monthly recruitment level does not appear sustainable when combined with the cost of pay deals and other health service pressures such as pharmaceuticals.”The spending review says that the 2018 health budget allocated an additional €494million for current expenditure. It warns that if recruitment continues at between 150 WTEs to 371 WTEs per month, it will cost an estimated additional €359 million to €396 million this year .“This would mean that 73 per cent to 80 per cent of the total current health budget would be spent on pay. This is beyond the pay bill budget and would only leave €98million to €135million of the additional budget (current expenditure) available to fund all other cost pressures in 2018. The review says from 2015 to 2017 the largest number of the additional staff taken on were recruited into acute services with 3,868 personnel taken on. “ While the greatest number of additional staff were directed toward acutes, in terms of percentage growth in the staff numbers the service area which experienced the greatest percentage growth is health and wellbeing with a 13 per cent increase in staffing over the 2 year period. The areas with the lowest percentage growth in staff were primary care and mental health with 4 percent each. It suggests this is contrary to official health policy. The review says that compared to other OECD countries Ireland has a relatively low number of doctors per 1,000 population. “It can be seen that Ireland’s international position did not change over the period 2009 to 2015 despite a number of policy changes in the area of recruitment. In 2015, the number of doctors per 1,000 population in Ireland has now moved past 2009 levels.”“Contrary to findings on doctors per capita, Ireland has a considerable number of nurses per capita compared to other OECD countries. Ireland is in the higher quadrant of OECD countries when comparing the number of nurses per 1,000 population. When looking at the change in the same metric over time it can be seen that the number of nurses per 1,000 population in 2015 is almost back at the same level experienced in 2009.

Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersTheresa May travelled to the most westerly point of the United Kingdom on Thursday as part of her two-day Northern Ireland visit designed to try to provide reassurance about what “Brexit means Brexit” means.She could tell she was on the Border when she called to the Belleek Pottery before teatime, because just across the river Erne bridge, on the Donegal side, a Tricolour was flying on a hill at a place called The Battery.As locals know well, that was where the IRA launched fairly regular sniper and mortar bomb attacks on the local Royal Ulster Constabulary base during the Troubles. But May was in no danger in Belleek, as the PSNI and Garda were securing the farthest point of the realm.The prime minister probably felt safer on the frontier in Co Fermanagh in any case, judging by the potshots from the likes of Boris Johnson she has been dodging over in London over the muddle that is the UK quitting the European Union. But Downing Street wasn’t taking any chances. Calls to the Number 10 press office on Thursday morning elicited some rather Kafkaesque explanations about why reporters couldn’t simply and specifically be told where she was going.“The prime minister will be in – I’ll spell it for you in case I mispronounce it – F-e-r-m-a-n-a-g-h during the day,” said the official.“Big county, which part?” The  inquired.Downing Street would let us know after she’d been and gone, said the official.Moreover, as was confirmed separately, the PM would not be talking to the press.This was odd, considering that the purpose of her visit was to broadcast a message that there would be no hard Border across the bridge over the Erne, or at any other North-South crossing, or indeed down the middle of the Irish Sea.Other British prime ministers generally haven’t been timid about fielding reporters’ questions in Northern Ireland – Margaret Thatcher, for instance, would swat away awkward queries with a metaphorical swish of her handbag — but May appears averse to the cut and thrust of such engagement.Not an issue was the line from Downing Street: all relevant matters would be addressed in a speech she is delivering on Friday, which the press would be permitted to attend, we were told. But Number 10 would not confirm where she was visiting.Still, it didn’t take much detective work to find out from early Thursday Northern Ireland’s famed dogs in the street who know everything were more than willing to disclose that she would be at Belleek Pottery to meet Border businesspeople.And even that meeting was rather peculiar. The local chairwoman of the Belleek Chamber of Commerce, Bridie Gormley, who runs a pub and a guesthouse, was invited by the pottery to meet the prime minister. But, Gormley added, when she got there she was excluded from the meeting.“But I don’t think her visit to Belleek is going to make a big difference one way or the other,” said Gormley. “I think it was just ticking another box.”At least she got to see the prime minister. Among the Belleek businesspeople who did not was Louis Culkin, who has shoe shops in Ballyshannon, Co Donegal, 6km away, and in Irvinestown, Co Fermanagh, 32km away, and Patsy McAuley, who is a funeral director in Belleek.McAuley explained that such is the “geographical lie of the land” that quite frequently he would bury people from the North in Ballyshannon and people from Co Donegal in Belleek. He feared that Brexit would lead to bureaucratic “pandemonium” for cross-Border bereaved families.Culkin said his message to May would have been “rerun the referendum”. “I am not prepared to sit at customs checkpoints. We did that a long time ago and we have moved on from it I don’t want to go back to that.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Clodagh KilcoynePATheresa May will use a speech in Belfast on Friday to rule out agreeing to any Border backstop based on the European Union’s proposal to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market. Speaking at Belfast’s Waterfront Hall, she will say that the EU’s proposal is in breach of the Belfast Agreement, leaving the people of Northern Ireland without their own voice in trade negotiations and would be destabilising for their economy.“The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal ‘third country’ customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept. And as they made clear this week, it is not something the House of Commons will accept either,” she will say.MPs this week backed an amendment to a customs Bill, proposed by Brexiteer backbenchers and accepted by Ms May’s government, that would prevent Northern Ireland being part of a different customs regime to the rest of the UK. In Belfast, the prime minister will say that the notion of a hard border is unacceptable and almost inconceivable. But she will argue that her Chequers proposal would solve the Border issue by creating a free trade area for goods which would avoid the need for customs and regulatory checks at the Border.“We can negotiate a new relationship with the EU that works in our mutual interest. One that honours the referendum result, gives us control of our money, our borders and our laws. One that sets us on course for a prosperous future, protecting jobs and boosting prosperity. One that safeguards our union and allows the whole UK to thrive in the years ahead. A brighter future for Northern Ireland – where we restore devolution and come together again as a community to serve the interests of the people,” she will say.The Chequers proposal and the White Paper the British government published last week have ided Conservatives but the prime minister will say on Friday that they amount to a realistic proposal and that it is now for the EU to respond. “Not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable. But to evolve their position in kind. And, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions,” she will say.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

incinerated the equivalent of\u0026nbsp81,000 of its signature plaid scarves, according to its latest annual accounts, in a practice said to be rife among fashion houses.Industry insiders\u0026nbspsay high-end brands burn\u0026nbspunwanted stock to prevent their clothes being sold at knockdown prices and worn by the\u0026nbsp“wrong people”.But the fashion houses\u0026nbspsay surplus goods are incinerated to prevent them falling into the hands of counterfeiters.Burberry destroyed more than £90m of products over the last five years, and the amount burnt annually has increased dramatically. In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down.

Ever since the first dino fossils were discovered in the early 19th\u0026nbspcentury, we have been desperate to know as much as we possibly can\u0026nbspabout these remarkable creatures. And as our knowledge grows, so our perceptions change.Imagine that time travel had been invented, and that for a limited time this summer you could journey back 67 million years\u0026nbspto the Late Cretaceous and the Age of the Dinosaurs, to see animals like triceratops and tyrannosaurus\u0026nbsproaming free in the landscape around you.Such is the opening premise of Dinosaurs in the Wild, a unique, immersive and\u0026nbspinteractive visitor attraction based at the Greenwich Peninsula, in London, until 2 September. I have been involved as the scientific consultant. Our aim with this experience is to present an absolutely modern, science-based view of dinosaurs and their world – and I’m pleased to say it has won critical praise from the palaeontologists, palaeoartists and other experts who’ve visited so far. However, things are a bit weirder than you might imagine.It’s the look of our dinosaurs, created using the latest photo-real computer generated imagery,\u0026nbspthat most strikes visitors. The creatures are boldly patterned, brightly coloured, often fuzzy, feathery or spiny, and with unusual features that make their fleshy outlines different from their skeletons. These aren’t the dinosaurs your parents or grandparents would have seen in the books or exhibitions of previous generations. Nor are they even the dinosaurs of cinema’s most notable dinosaur-themed outing, 1993’s Jurassic Park, nor of its sequels (including 2015’s Jurassic World and 2018’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom).Indeed, this week marks the 25th anniversary of Jurassic Park’s UK cinema release, and even now it has to be considered a milestone event in cinema. It took CGI, robotics and model-making to a new level, wowing audiences with the innovations and craftmanship of Steven Spielberg’s team, Stan Winston Studio and Industrial Light and Magic.And from the perspective of science education as well, Jurassic Park was a major score. Gone were the solitary, tail-dragging, Godzilla-like monsters of yore. Instead we saw complex, group-living animals that walk and run like birds, keep their tails up off the ground, and are smart enough to ambush humans and negotiate the interiors of buildings.alamosaurus (Dinosaurs in the Wild)In bringing this science-based view of dinosaurs to the silver screen, Spielberg naturally worked with expert consultants. The result was that the view of dinosaurs that emerged among palaeontologists during the late 1960s – a scientific and cultural event known as the Dinosaur Renaissance – found a new audience. So significant and inspirational was Jurassic Park’s scientifically informed view of dinosaurs that many professionals working on dinosaurs and other ancient animals today trace their nascent interest in the subject to the movie.But if Jurassic Park was so on the ball, why are the dinosaurs in the new\u0026nbspDinsosaurs of the Wild attraction so very different? The answer is that much has changed in the past few decades in our scientific understanding of dinosaurs. So much so that 1993 feels like a long time ago, with the result that Jurassic Park’s dinosaurs are now surprisingly dated.Notably, the people behind Jurassic Park opted not to feather their dinosaurs, specifically the bird-like predator deinonychus (called velociraptor in the movie). There are two takes on this issue. One is that the scientists of the early 1990s didn’t have sufficient fossil evidence to run with the idea of feathery dinosaurs. After all, a feathered, non-bird dinosaur fossil didn’t show up until 1996 (the term “non-bird dinosaur” is now a necessity given that birds are dinosaurs in the same way that primates are mammals). That fossil is the original specimen of sinosauropteryx, a small, long-tailed predator that lived in eastern China around 130 million years ago.But a second take is that, although the idea of feathery non-bird dinosaurs was looking really, really likely even in 1992-93 (the skeletons of early birds like Archaeopteryx and near-bird dinosaurs like deinonychus and velociraptor are extremely similar), the technological limitations of the time and Spielberg’s argument that a feathery deinonychus just wouldn’t look scary led Jurassic Park’s creators to play it safe.Two and half decades on and hundreds of feathered dinosaur fossils have now been unearthed from the same region that yielded sinosauropteryx. These and other fossils found in recent times show that feathers and feathery-like filaments, quills and fuzz were widespread across the large group of bird-like, mostly predatory dinosaurs called coelurosaurs. Among this group are the tyrannosaurs. So – should tyrannosaurs be fuzzy or feathery as well?The 2016 discovery of a giant, fuzz-covered tyrannosaur in China – the nine-metre long yutyrannus – proves that big tyrannosaurs were indeed, just like their smaller cousins, in which case even the gigantic tyrannosaurus should be reconstructed with a fuzzy coat. Based on this evidence, the tyrannosaurus at Dinosaurs in the Wild has feathering across at least some of its upper surface. But this idea has since been contested: some experts argue that skin impressions show how tyrannosaurus and kin underwent an evolutionary transition back to scaly skin. Argument here continues and more data is needed.ankylosaurus (Dinosaurs in the Wild)Dinosaurs were flamboyant, showy creatures. Frills, crests and horns on the head and sails and spines along the back were commonplace. Similar structures in living animals – cattle, deer, beetles and chameleons – are associated with sexual display and with battles that occur during the breeding season. Combine this with the fact that dinosaurs almost definitely had excellent colour vision – an inference based on eyesight in their living relatives – and the Age of Dinosaurs was surely flashy, colourful, even gaudy.Jurassic Park and Jurassic World again opted to be conservative, there being much grey and mud brown but little else. We very much went for the opposite in Dinosaurs in the Wild. Our triceratops has red striping across its face and enormous bony frill, our tyrannosaurs have bright red faces used in signalling and intimidation, and our feathery dakotaraptor is patterned in black and white and has a red forehead.Hard evidence for the colours of dinosaurs is rare but does at least exist: microscopic cellular structures termed melanosomes were reported from dinosaur fossils in 2010 and have so far been identified in around eight non-bird dinosaurs. They reveal evidence for colours, patterns and even iridescence on the feathers and skin of select species, and more such discoveries are sure to be forthcoming now that experts know what to look for.New thinking also has it that dinosaurs were not just gaudy and colourful. As explained in the 2012 book All Yesterdays, both the anatomy of living animals and a number of “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns” (thanks, Rumsfeld) render it likely that dinosaurs were sometimes weirder in anatomy than long thought. Air-filled sacs distributed throughout the body and skeleton, enormous bony hollows surrounding the nostrils and evidence for big masses of erectile tissue on the face suggest that some dinosaurs had inflatable or erectile wattles, dewlaps, sacs and other structures. This sounds odd but such structures are present in many modern birds and would be hard or impossible to predict if we only knew these animals from their bones.It’s for this reason that the gigantic, armour-plated ankylosaurus in our vision possesses inflatable facial structures best described as cheek balloons.\u0026nbspSurprising yet plausible features like this may well have been commonplace across the dinosaur world.Finally, what about behaviour? The Jurassic franchise has always made nods to the idea – made scientifically robust during the Dinosaur Renaissance – that dinosaurs of many sorts were more social and behaviourally complex than the solitary brutes of convention.Fossil nests discovered in the 1970s showed that dinosaurs of several sorts nested colonially, that nest-building and nest-care were common, and that at least some species guarded their babies and even provisioned them with food. Baby dinosaurs preserved away from the nest environment are typically found in groups and are sometimes found in association with the remains of an adult.And both tracks and assemblages of skeletons show that many dinosaurs lived in groups, ranging from twos or threes in big predators to tens or hundreds in the case of many plant-eaters. It remains open to debate as to whether\u0026nbspdeinonychus and its kin used the coordinated group-hunting portrayed in Jurassic Park, but the door is certainly open for social behaviour of many kinds.One very specific behavioural nugget does separate Jurassic Park from Dinosaurs in the Wild. Our dinosaurs don’t roar like lions. Roaring with a wide-open mouth seems normal to us, because we’re mammals. But dinosaurs aren’t mammals, and if we look at their closest living relatives – crocodylians and big birds like emus and ostriches – we see that loud sounds are made with a closed mouth, the noises emanating from the throat and chest.Dinosaurs in the Wild Dinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildMaybe this is an example of science ruining something that seems awesome and dramatic. Or maybe this is one of those cases where we benefit by having our assumptions corrected by discovery where we learn that nature is sometimes different from that which we might expect.Add all of this together, and science is revealing a colourful, vibrant, complex Age of Dinosaurs quite different from the one imagined back when Jurassic Park was under production. Dinosaurs in the Wild\u0026nbsppresents the scientific state of the art as it stands in 2018. But much remains to be discovered and a scientific attraction constructed decades from now may well look even more remarkable.Dr Darren Naish is a palaeontologist and scientific consultant at Dinosaurs in the Wild.\u0026nbspHaving thrilled time travellers in Birmingham and Manchester, the experience is now established at a custom-built home on London’s Greenwich Peninsula, a short walk from\u0026nbspNorth Greenwich Underground station,\u0026nbspuntil 2 September.

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies.

Apple\u0027s high-end HomePod\u0026nbspis anticipated to only control 4 per cent of the market.Samsung first revealed that it was developing a smart speaker last year at its Galaxy Note 8 event, however no official word has been given on when to expect it.The president of Samsung\u0027s mobile ision, DJ Koh, told CNBC in August: Maybe soon we will announce it. I am already working on it... As I mentioned, I wanted to provide a fruitful user experience at home with Samsung devices, and I want to be moving quite heavily on it.A\u0026nbsplaunch date for the Bixby\u0026nbspsmart speaker – code-named Lux – could be less than one month away, with a Galaxy Note 9 event on 9 August a likely time to unveil the device.Rumours about Samsung\u0027s next premium handset have been spreading online in the build up to its launch, with several leaked images appearing to show the Galaxy Note 9 from various angles.The images appear to show a device that is almost identical in appearance to the Galaxy Note 8, confirming speculation from analysts that the biggest updates will be\u0026nbspwith the smartphone\u0027s internal specs.Various rumours suggest the Note 9 will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, 6GB of RAM and an improved camera and battery capacity.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

When Mr Xing inspected the specimen through its honey coloured encasement and noticed the diamond shaped pattern of its scales, he realised what he was holding was actually a 99-million-year-old snakeskin.Mr\u0026nbspXing, who is a paleontologist from the China University of Geosciences in Beijing, had previously recovered a feathered dinosaur tail and a baby bird in the amber markets. But he said that of the hundreds of thousands of amber pieces discovered in the area, no one had ever before found a snake.He purchased the snakeskin and set up a meeting with Michael Caldwell, a snake paleontologist at the University of Alberta. A few minutes before Mr Xing boarded his flight to Canada, a different colleague alerted him to another recently discovered snake specimen that was more amazing than the first: entombed in a silver-dollar-sized chunk of amber was a baby snake.“The fossil is the first baby snake and the oldest baby snake to yet be found,” said Mr Xing. Before this finding, paleontologists had not uncovered a fossilised baby snake even in the rock fossil record, said Mr Caldwell.Mr Xing and Mr Caldwell reported their findings from the two specimens on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. The work provides insight into the evolution of snakes, their early stage anatomical development and their prehistoric spread across the globe.Only the bottom half of the baby snake’s sinuous body was preserved in the amber, which is fossilised tree resin. Because the skull was missing, the people who found the fossil thought the tiny creature inside was either a centipede or millipede.But closer inspection revealed its bones. And through the use of a micro-CT scanner and a synchrotron, scientists confirmed that the specimen was a baby snake, a new species they named Xiaophis myanmarensis. It resembles existing species of pipe and grass snakes.World news in picturesArab lawmakers stand up in protest during a Knesset session in Jerusalem.

Like modern baby snakes, the preserved baby had tiny vertebral bones but a large spinal cord tube, according to Mr Caldwell. That’s a telltale sign that the snake was still developing, as well as the first direct evidence that the developmental processes seen in a baby snake’s spine were established at least about 100 million years ago and have remained relatively unchanged since then.The researchers could not say whether or not the shed snakeskin belonged to the same species as the baby snake.Ryan McKellar, a paleontologist from the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Canada and an author on the paper, said the fossilised snakeskin was trapped along with plants, cockroaches and insect droppings. Those clues indicated that the ancient snake lived in the forest. That may seem like a likely locale for a slithering snake, but before this discovery, paleontologists did not have direct evidence of snakes living in forests during the Mesozoic Era.‘Monstrous’ new sabre-toothed creatures unearthed in Russia Fossil reveals how ancient crocodiles evolved into dolphin-like animalCosta Rica to ban fossil fuels and become first decarbonised societyFirst birds had beaks with teeth, prehistoric fossils show HSBC to largely stop funding fossil fuel industriesScientists are not sure where snakes originated from and how they spread throughout the world. The new specimens offer clues for one potential pathway for their prehistoric movement around the planet, said Dr. McKellar.Some 100 million years ago when the snakes became trapped in tree resin, Myanmar was part of a migrating island between present day Asia and Australia. That island eventually floated to the coast of Laurasia, a supercontinent that then included present day Europe and Asia.“These snakes would have been along for the ride,” he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Some even suggested that it should not be opened, for fear that it could unleash a hideous curse.It was found next to a giant alabaster head that served only to deepen the mystery of what was inside.Black sarcophagus found in Egypt is finally openedEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesNow archaeologists\u0026nbsphave prised open the eldritch box to find it was filled with dirty\u0026nbspwater and three skeletons, according to Egypt\u0027s Ministry of Antiquities.The water probably found its way into the box from a sewage trench, the ministry said. It may have caused the mummies to decompose and leave only their skeletons.The bodies are probably those of warriors. One of the them appears to have a wound that is the result of being hit by an arrow, experts said.Local reports suggested that officials from the Ministry of Antiquities mocked suggestions that the sarcophagus could unleash evil forces\u0026nbspor curses when\u0026nbspopened.In fact, it appeared to contain little of any note. There were no inscriptions or objects inside the coffin that would suggest the bodies belonged to members of an ancient royal family, for instance.Some had hoped that the tomb could contain the body of Alexander The Great, which would help solve one of antiquity\u0027s greatest mysteries. But there is nothing to suggest that any of the skeletons belong to that famed warrior and empire builder.Alexander\u0027s body has never been found. He asked for his corpse to be thrown into the\u0026nbspEuphrates river – but speculation has been rife ever since that his body was actually disposed of in a tomb, and that it is still lying waiting to be found.Either way it is incredibly rare to find an unopened sarcophagus in Alexandria. Anyone planning to build in the city must first have archaeologists inspect the site, and while they occasionally find\u0026nbspsarcophagi they have usually been looted.The skeletons will now be removed from the site and sent to the National Museum of Alexandria, the ministry said.

They’ve hired almost a thousand customs officials just in case Britain crashes out.“We’re a trading nation we cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exports of goods and services. We also hired veterinary officials because if you crash out, you also have that problem.”Dutch port officials told The Independent this year the Netherlands’\u0026nbspcustoms authorities were aiming to hire between 750 and 930 officials – suggesting the number actually hired is right at the upper end of that early estimate as talks look increasingly likely to fail.On Friday, ministers from the remaining 27 EU states are expected to be presented with a dossier drawn up by the European Commission laying out how to plan for a “no deal” Brexit.\u0026nbspWe cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exportsThe Netherlands has been amongst the best prepared EU member states regarding Brexit, with ports like Rotterdam and hub airports like Schipol planning significant physical changes to accommodate the extra checks likely to slow down trade following Britain’s departure.Preparations in the UK are behind schedule for a “no deal” scenario, with huge overflow lorry parks needed to accommodate freight in Kent not expected to be completed in time if Britain does crash out.Mr Omtzigt was scathing at the UK’s lack of preparations for its Brexit talks and the timing of the white paper outlining the nation’s Brexit ambitions: “I share concerns that it’s a bit late in the day, that one year and four months after tabling the Article 50 notification, the UK makes a proposal.“I think it’s a proposal that’s a good starting point for negotiations – but it’s a proposal to start negotiations. It would have been helpful that that had been on the table the day the negotiations started.”Ms May\u0026nbsphas repeatedly said “no deal is better than a bad deal” and threatened to lead the UK off an economic cliff edge if she does not get her way in talks with the EU.Asked whether the UK was hiring more customs officers, cabinet office minister David Lidington\u0026nbspsaid: “I think that all governments, including the United Kingdom government, have to plan for all contingencies.”Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Only the ruling\u0026nbspUnited Russia fraction voted for, with all of the controlled “opposition” parties voting against.\u0026nbspSeveral deputies in the ruling party, hitherto known for demonstrative displays of loyalty, were mysteriously absent from the vote.\u0026nbspThe main provisions of the reform see the pension age increase from 60 for men and 55 for women, to 65 and 63 respectively. Its sponsors say the changes are necessary to bring the law into line with new life expectancy figures. Pension ages were last set in 1936, when pensioners accounted for no more than 2 per cent of the population. \u0026nbsp“Life has changed,”\u0026nbspthe employment\u0026nbspminister\u0026nbspMaxim\u0026nbspTopilin\u0026nbsptold parliamentarians. “We can’t remain in the 1930s.”\u0026nbspThe contentious issue of pension reform has been raised several times in the last two decades, but the government has repeatedly chosen to delay. It presented the bill in\u0026nbspless than auspicious economic times. Most Russians have faced real-terms wage falls since 2014, and the outlook is grim.\u0026nbspMr Putin’s trust ratings have\u0026nbspfallen to the lowest recorded ebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters.Critics have also railed against the way the pensions plan was communicated, announced with no discussion a few hours before kick off during the opening match of the World Cup, between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia. Fnance\u0026nbspminister Anton Siluanov has insisted that this was a coincidence, but the public outcry was real.\u0026nbsp“It is a bastardly way to introduce reform,” said the former Kremlin adviser Gleb Pavlovsky in an interview on the Echo of Moscow radio station. “The people have a deal with the Kremlin in return for not protesting – and the most important part of that deal is that they are given the chance to survive.”\u0026nbspIn some regions\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspproposed pension ages fall below average life expectancy\u0026nbsp– in Chukotka,\u0026nbspin the country’s far east, the male life expectancy is 60.33, nearly five years below the proposed pension age.\u0026nbspFor many families\u0026nbspthe change will represent a fundamental shift to their way of life. Even according to state pollsters, eight out of\u0026nbsp10 Russians do not agree with the plans. There have already been\u0026nbspprotests against the reform.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the bill, 14 people were arrested at an unsanctioned rally in St Petersburg.\u0026nbspRegardless of whether significant protests follow, the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever,\u0026nbspsays the political analyst Ekaterina Shulman\u0026nbsp“It is a tectonic shift. Even before the pension reform, people were viewing the state as less and less of a father figure. But the reform strengthens that perception.”In Ms Shulman’s view, these changes will affect the transfer of power between Vladimir Putin and his anointed successor, a process which may begin as early as 2021.\u0026nbspThe paw of Mr Putin has remained strangely hidden throughout the process. His press secretary,\u0026nbspDmitry Peskov, has distanced the president from the unpopular bill.\u0026nbspReports, on the other\u0026nbsphand, suggested the president approved the plan before its first reading. And all the while, state media have been kept under strict control. They have been told to avoid the word “reform”, to avoid associations with the “chaotic” 1990s, but nonetheless to keep close to a line emphasising the necessity of reform.\u0026nbspThere may not be protests, but the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever\u0026nbspBut the attempt to differentiate a\u0026nbspgood tsar from bad\u0026nbspboyars might not have been altogether successful.On the back of the controversy, trust\u0026nbspin Mr Putin has fallen to\u0026nbspthe lowest recorded\u0026nbspebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters. And perhaps more significantly, the president’s ratings are falling steadily\u0026nbspin line with government popularity. This is the first time this has happened since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\u0026nbspSome now wonder if the president is in danger of losing his Teflon coating.\u0026nbspIt may, of course, have been another coincidence, but on the eve and the day of the vote\u0026nbspthe Russian military released several videos purporting to show the testing of new cutting-edge “Avangard” and “Kinzhal” missiles. Russians are generally supportive of the president’s assertive foreign policy stance – as opposed to domestic policies with which they interact with every day.Propaganda directors may have decided to use the opportunity to play down\u0026nbspreaction to the proposal.\u0026nbspWelcome to the real Russia, on eve of electionRussia\u0027s imperial capital is the starting point of our journey Chudovo was one of the first stops of Radishchev\u0027s journeyThey say the fish rot from the head down429 On the way out of ChudovoWe choose our president, we choose our futurePeople have become fussy and want clear waterLife is just great Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Navalny\u0027s activists continue campaign despite their leader being barred from the elections Thatcher was a bitch, but I liked her.

15 per cent of the parliamentary party - he must call a confidence vote in the leader.The total received so far has not been disclosed.Mr Davies is the third MP to go public about sending a letter, though a fourth, Simon Clarke, withdrew his own letter this week after changing his mind.Mr Davies told voters in his West Yorkshire constituency of Shipley that Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan was unacceptable.He wrote: Politics is all about trust and once it is lost it is impossible to win back.Many people have told me that as a result of this they have lost trust in the PM to properly and fully deliver the referendum result.It is with much sadness that I have to say that I have also lost trust in her to deliver the referendum result too.Failure to keep our promise to the electorate will almost certainly lead to the catastrophe of Jeremy Corbyn becoming Prime Minister and I cannot sit back and allow that to happen."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/prince-harry-991557.jpg","title":"meghan markle prince harry royal wedding carriage royal news london","story":"Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex visit the Nelson Mandela Centenary Exhibition  (Image:  IMAGES)Meghan and Harry were cheered by more than 100,000 people when they travelled through the streets of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage on May 19.\u0026nbspA beaming Meghan and Harry waved to crowds following their romantic wedding ceremony in St George\u0026rsquos Chapel, in Windsor Castle.And now the beautiful Ascot Landau carriage can now be seen by the public at the Royal Mews in central London.Meghan rode in the carriage wearing an elegant wedding dress designed by Givenchy\u0026rsquos Clare Waight Keller and the Queen Mary Diamond Bandeau tiara.

Britain can thrive with \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo say expertsFor example, a milk product with a fat content of 3-6 percent has a tariff of 74 percent, fresh mozzarella 41 percent and unripened cheese 68 percent.Arla Foods UK Managing Director Ash Amirahmadi warned: The heavy dependency on EU imports means that all problems at the Brexit border and shortage of labour in key areas are likely to have a significant and predominantly negative impact on the Internal Market in the form of product shortages and significantly higher prices.Any interruption means that if we can not take advantage of Brexit\u0027s practical options, we can choose between bottlenecks, additional costs that inevitably need to be passed on to the consumer, and undermining the world-class standards that we apply for which we have worked so hard.But even if Britain leaves the bloc with a Brexit deal, the report warned that imports could still face costly delays at various ports.It estimates that a seven minute delay at a port such as Dover, due to more detailed customs inspections, will add a minimum \u0026pound11 extra per container.Brexit dairy products: We cannot just switch milk production on and off (Image: )Rules of origin prices could increase by \u0026pound45, with veterinary checks costing around \u0026pound50.60 per consignment.The UK Customs Declarations Service, which will process only 150 million customs declarations per year, will be forced to significantly up that to 230 million.The report does suggest that \u0026ldquoBrexit could provide opportunities for long-term expansion of British industry, but Mr Amirahmadi warned that much pain lies ahead following Brexit and any positive impact will take years to be felt.He said: \u0026ldquoBrexit might bring opportunities to expand the UK industry in the long-term, but in the short- and medium-term we cannot just switch milk production on and off.\u0026ldquoIncreasing the UK\u0026rsquos milk pool and building the infrastructure for us to be self-sufficient in dairy will take years.Mr Amirahmadi added: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos no margin to play with here in the value chain.\u0026ldquoAny disruption means that if we don\u0026rsquot get the practicalities of Brexit right we will face a choice between shortages, extra costs that will inevitably have to be passed on to the consumer, or undermining the world-class standards we have worked so hard to achieve.The LSE report comes exactly a year after after food policy experts warned the Government is \u0026ldquosleepwalking into a post-Brexit future of insecure, unsafe and expensive food supplies, with little clue on how to replace decades of EU regulation on the issue.Additional reporting by Monika Pallenberg.Brexit could mean dairy products, such as cheese, could become \u0027luxury\u0027 products (Image: )"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/An-amazing-361-golden-retrievers-met-up-for-a-chin-wag-in-Strathglass-991556.jpg","title":"scotland news gold retriever gathering biggest world strathglass invernessshire","story":"An amazing 361 golden retrievers met up for a chin-wag in Strathglass  (Image: NC)And just like previous\u0026nbspgatherings of the Scottish Golden Retriever Club, the numbers involved keep going up.The chairman of the club, Doreen McGugan, said: \u0026ldquoThe 150th has been a roaring success.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup.

But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination. Only when FTAs are in place with a broad swathe of countries, including the US, will we be able to see the full impact.The argument that we must accept the Chequers fudge just does not add up.

The Commission’s own figures show Remain vastly outspent Leave — on top of the £9million David Cameron wasted leafleting every home begging us to vote to stay in.The odds were massively stacked against Leave and they still won.This Remain rearguard action has nothing to do with the vote’s legitimacy.It is just a continuing tantrum, aimed at the 17.4million who disagreed with them.IMAGINE the outrage if a newspaper hosted online videos of kids being abused.Facebook does, and refuses to remove them.

It would be hard for any politician to make an outright success of this.But where Theresa May HAS failed categorically is on communicating her plans to the British people.The Chequers deal should have been a big moment. She should have been all over the TV stations selling this deal hard.In the past, prime ministers held public broadcasts to explain important matters to the people. Anthony Eden gave one on the Suez crisis, Harold Wilson on the devaluation of the Pound. Ted Heath warned in 1973 that the nation faced “the hardest Christmas that we have known since the war”.These leaders looked the nation in the eye, spoke directly to the British people — and LED.Theresa May, on the other hand, seems reluctant to get out and make the case for her own policy.Little wonder that two thirds of the public questioned on the Chequers deal were baffled by it. Confusion reigns.This points to a major problem with May’s premiership. She is hopeless at telling a national story.It’s the job of a leader not just to make decisions but to inspire the nation. For the person in No10, their words speak as loudly as their actions. They need to tell a compelling story about where Britain is going.Margaret Thatcher told the story of Britain emerging from the ashes of socialism thanks to the hard work and enterprise of its people: “A get-up-and-go instead of a sit-back-and-wait-for- it Britain.”Tony Blair told the story of Britain shrugging off the past and embracing the modern world: “A new Britain . . . a model 21st-century nation, based not on privilege, class or background, but on the equal worth of all.”David Cameron told the story of Britain clearing up the economic mess left by Labour, paying down our debts and living within our means.Love or loathe these leaders, at least they told a clear story about where Britain was going. We get none of this from May.She makes a virtue of just “getting on with the job”. But in a nation divided on Brexit, we desperately need more. We need a clear sense of direction for Britain’s future.Of course, the Prime Minister cannot last for much longer. In boxing terms she’s in the 12th round. Before long there will be a leadership contest — and those hoping to succeed May must learn from where she went wrong.The next resident of No10 must not only have the right policies but the right vision.If Britain is to regain its reputation abroad, and its self-respect at home, we urgently need a Prime Minister who inspires, who tells a national story — and who truly leads.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sadly, a year or so later they also voted to keep the appalling Anna Soubry as their local MP. Let’s hope they never make that mistake again.For the last year this bilious, jabbering woman has done everything she possibly can to thwart the will of her electors.She is a staunch Remainer and is seemingly prepared to bring down the Government to get her way. Her actions suggest she couldn’t give a monkey’s about what the people in her constituency think.Two nights ago she was one of 12 Conservative rebels who voted against the Government. She wanted Britain to remain part of a customs union with the EU. That would mean — effectively — no real Brexit. And if they had won, it would have been catastrophe for the Government. And in my opinion, the country.The reason they didn’t lose is solely down to a bunch of courageous Labour MPs, including the excellent Frank Field, who voted with the Government. Soubry isn’t alone, of course. The people of Loughborough, Leics, also voted by a large margin to leave the EU.But they are represented in the House of Commons by Nicky Morgan, who appears not to give a toss what they think. She also voted for a customs union. Nicky is famous among many for being the second worst Education Secretary this country has ever had. She’s pipped to the post for that particular prize by Justine Greening.Being useless in their Cabinet posts isn’t the only thing that unites these two women. Greening is also opposed to Brexit and she has even called for a second referendum. Because she didn’t like the result of the first one.The people of Beaconsfield, Bucks, voted to leave the EU. But their MP, the grim Dominic Grieve, who resembles a funeral director from about 1923, appears not to care less. He has said he’s prepared to “collapse” the Government if he does not get his way.Sarah Wollaston is another one. Another embittered MP. Her constituency, Totnes in Devon, voted to leave by a sizeable margin.Because while it is true that the majority of Labour MPs are also opposed to Brexit, they have been nothing like as dangerous as the Tory rebels.We are in a mess. The Prime Minister staggers from crisis to crisis, striking meaningless deals whenever she can to stave off defeat for a few more days.She surely cannot last much longer. A Remainer herself, of course, I think she should be persuaded to call it a day. Go home, put her feet up. And let her party elect a leader who will take no more c**p from Brussels.And no more c**p from the likes of Soubry and Greening, either.THE top scientist Richard Dawkins – Britain’s most famous atheist – has got himself into trouble.He has said that he prefers to hear the sound of cathedral bells to the muezzin wail calling Muslims to prayer.  Saying something as inoffensive as that is enough to get you into hot water these days.Dawkins has been called a bigot as a consequence. I have to say I disagree with him. I love the sound of cathedral bells, sure.But I also enjoying hearing the Muslim call to prayer – when I’ve been on my travels in Morocco or Malaysia. But, over here, it’s cathedral bells for me every time.Here’s a tip, then.Take them to an expensive shoe shop and make them look at the display through the window.And remember the noise they make.KATIE PRICE is on holiday in Thailand and of course she’s got her baps out.  This might be a problem for Katie, pictured with boyfriend Kris Boyson.Topless sunbathing is against the law over there. This is because tourists enjoy looking at the scenic islands. Without having their view obliterated by a pair of breasts the size of Koh Samui.So watch yourself, Katie. And as a break from lying on the beach, how do you fancy a spot of caving?YOU’VE got to love the toffs, haven’t you?  Most of them are absolutely crazy after years of inbreeding.Take the brilliant Lizzie Purbrick who described herself as “a very well-bred toff”.  She went round to her married lover’s home after he’d cheated on her with a third woman.No messing with Lizzie. She took with her eight litres of pig’s blood which she sprayed across his flat. She daubed the words “slut” and “whore” and “big d**k lord” on his walls and sprayed a giant penis on the floor.  She said: “So many people have said I should write my life story, but I’m so bonkers I can’t remember it.”The judge said – in one of the great under-statements of the decade – that she had “real concerns about the defendant’s ability to make rational decisions”.No s**t, Sherlock.It started out a few years back with just a couple of stalls. Now the entire town centre is closed off and thousands turn up to pig themselves on cuisine from scores of nationalities.I got so stuffed last year I needed to be helped home. And not a chicken parmo – the supposed Teesside dish of choice – in sight.IT’S not often that the Labour peer Dame Margaret Hodge says something worth repeating. But in telling her party leader Jeremy Corbyn that he was a “f***ing anti-Semite and a racist” I think she kinda hit the nail on the head.Meanwhile, the decent, moderate Labour MP John Woodcock has resigned the party whip and become an independent.Long-time party members – like I was, until last year – know that Labour is currently led by a hard-left anti-Jewish rabble of thickoes.I hope the voters twig this sooner or later.AND now it’s time for Hypocrites of the Week. A special award for Pimlico Plumbers of London.They’ve put up a giant banner outside their premises about Brexit, saying: “Nobody voted to be poorer!”Pimlico Plumbers has just lost a landmark case brought by one of its employees. He, like almost all of their staff, was kept on a contract which allowed the firm to pay him less than the proper rate.They were done under a UK Supreme Court decision, using laws designed to stop unscrupulous firms exploiting cheap labour.I wonder what it is about the EU that Pimlico Plumbers likes so much?

It was a really sweet moment.“He treated Tommy like a normal person and no different to before he knew he had autism.“He wasn’t shocked by it which was really nice. It was lovely for him to be included.“A lot of people don’t really understand it [autism] but he was really lovely.“It was quite nice to watch. We don’t really see a lot of people interacting with Tommy on that level.“I just hope that everybody with additional needs can be accepted for who they are and that more people learn how such a simple gesture can really mean so much to somebody.”Lauren was overwhelmed by the caring man and rang Tommy’s dad, Dan Matthews, 24, immediately after and they decided to use social media to try and pass on their thanks to this mystery person.She added: “When people learn about his autism, they tend to shy away from it and talk to me instead but I appreciate it can be difficult for people.“I don’t think a lot of people are educated in autism. It isn’t really spoken about.”Later that day, Lauren wrote in a Facebook post: “I just wanted to give this lovely man some recognition.“Instead of then ignoring him or being awkward about the news he had just learnt, he found an alternative way to communicate with him and that really means the world to me.“Im sure other parents with children who have additional needs will truly appreciate this too.“Unfortunately I didnt get his name but Mr Delivery Driver, if you see this, we thank you so much for your kindness.”The Facebook post has since received 8.6K likes and Lauren says she has spoken with the Tesco customer service team and was told her gratitude would be passed onto the delivery driver.- Autism is a lifelong developmental disability and a spectrum condition that affects how people perceive the world and interact with others.- Autistic people see, hear and feel the world differently to other people.Some say that the world feels overwhelming which can cause them significant anxiety.- Even though autistic people share certain struggles it can affect them in different ways. Relating to other people and understanding others can be a struggle as well as taking part in everyday social, family and school activities.- There are a variety of different levels of support a person with autism may need depending on whether they have learning disabilities, mental health issues or other conditions.- There are around 700,000 autistic people in the UK.- In order to be diagnosed with autism, a person will usually show signs of difficulties with social communication, social interaction and show restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviours, activities or interests from a young age, which may ‘limit and impair everyday functioning’. Tommy was officially diagnosed with autism in January this year after his parents began noticing his slow development and lack of communication.They have been told he currently has the mental age of an 18-month-old child.Tesco has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NIP000421587031-e1532024842290.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cadbury is launching a low calorie dairy milk choc bar and weve tasted it","story":"To avoid a backlash, Cadbury will sell the new version alongside the normal one for the same price, currently 60p for the standard 45g bar.But the low-sugar version won’t actually go on sale until next summer while the firm works out how to produce it on a mass scale.Other food and drinks firms who have simply launched a lower-sugar version have been criticised by customers.Cadburys Europe boss Glenn Caton said a team of 20 scientists and choc experts have been working for two years on a way to keep the taste and cut sugar – while using no artificial sweeteners, colours or preservatives.They have reformulated the bar by replacing some of the sugar with a type of fibre that has the same structure.‘I’m expecting the worst from latest Cadbury offering, a Dairy Milk with 30 per cent less sugar.As I put the chocolate in my mouth I prepare to pull a disgusted face but instead I’m pleasantly surprised as it hits my tongue.It has virtually the same familiar indulgent creamy taste of a traditional Dairy Milk bar. Although so it should, seeing as it has been years in the making.But there is one big difference to the original I know and love. The texture is much thicker.The traditional bar is so smooth, it almost instantly melts on your tongue and slides down your throat without needing to swallow. This reduced-sugar offering doesn’t.This one melts and then oozes over your tongue, giving it a heavy chocolatey coating that stays put until you swallow.Even after swallowing there is a little bit of sticky remnant left on my tongue.It’s this tiny bit of clagginess in the texture that tells me this bar hasn’t quite managed the perfect imitation of the fully-sugared original.But to be honest - if you are not as obsessed with chocolate as I am, you probably won’t notice the difference.’This way they can use less sugar but keep the texture – which experts pinpoint as a key feature of chocolate – the same.This is a different method to the one used Nestle which has lead the way in sugar reduction. They have altered the structure of sugar molecules to contain air which means they can use less of the product but the tongue senses the same level of sweetness.In early 2017, Nestle began launching lower sugar versions of treats, starting with KitKat and then Aero and Smarties.Sugar in chocolate varies but milk chocolate is typically around 50 per cent, white around 60 per cent and dark below 40 per cent and as low as zero.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: “The situation at the moment is that the UK is part of the single European sky.“If they leave the EU they are not, and that does mean if there was a no-deal hard Brexit next March, the planes would not fly and Britain would be an island in many ways. If they want their planes to fly over our skies, they would need to take that into account.”The Ireland boss insisted: “You can’t have your cake and eat it. You can’t take back your waters and then expect to take back other people’s sky”.A DExEU spokesman said: “We do not want or expect a no deal scenario. Our White Paper sets out both our desire to agree a mechanism for annual negotiations on access to waters and fishing opportunities, as well as reciprocal liberalised aviation access with the EU through an Air Transport Agreement.”But a senior UK government source branded the comments “mad”.British officials pointed out that freedoms of the air are not guaranteed by the EU, but a multilateral international treaty – the International Air Services Transit Agreement - signed from 1944 onwards, by 133 countries.The only way Ireland can block British planes flying over it would be to pull out of the treaty, which it has been a signatory to since 1957. Others said Britain could retaliate by blocking Irish planes from flying to mainland Europe over the UK, doubling the length of their journies.The Director of the Open Europe think tank Henry Newman said Mr Varadkar is “in danger of losing the plot”.Alex Macheras, Aviation Analyst, said “It’s a ridiculous statement and the reason why ICAO’s International Air Services Transit Agreement exists - of which Ireland are signatory - which ensures countries cannot simply ‘impose a ban’ on their airspace, and the treaty specifically states that countries are forbidden from discriminating against the nationality of an aircraft.“Ireland has very little airspace and if a ban were to take place Ireland would lose all flights operated to/from the country flown by aircraft with G- registrations, Great Britain. This is without mentioning that much of Ireland’s airspace management, and air traffic control, is actually based in the UK.”Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Sun: Air traffic control continued between Russia and the Ukraine after Russia invaded the Crimea so this idea is just silly.On the other hand most flights from the EU to America pass through our air traffic control so this rather lightweight Irish gentleman is proposing an absurd act of a masochistic nature. His words are those of an airhead.Andrew Rossindell MP said: Who will this benefit? Mr Varadka needs to think very long and hard before he makes statements like this. Its incredibly damaging to British-Irish relations and very short-sighted. If he thinks this would benefit Ireland, he needs to think again. In reality it would just be catastrophic for everyone.If his ideological obsession with the EU means Ireland cant have sensible relations with its closest neighbour and friend, its a tragedy and totally outrageous. He should stop taking his orders from Brussels and start thinking about the greater good of the people of Ireland and the whole of the British Isles.Ireland will always be tied to Britain, no matter what happens, and if it harms us it will harm them. He needs to change his attitude very urgently.Last night RAF legend John Nichol said: “Regardless of your views on Brexit, the notion that you can have a one way system is farcical and non sensical. It’s a ludicrous notion you can have a ban on civilian aircraft coming to one area but when you desperately need the Brits’ help you change your mind.“That would be strange and incomprehensible. “You really cannot have it both ways. We have spent years building up warm relations with Ireland. They should not be a republic of Brussels and think of their own long-term national interest. The EU will use them and spit them out, but we are genuinely Irelands best friend.Mr Varadka is playing a very dangerous game politically in trying to prevent Brexit.In a second rumpus, Mr Varadkar was also accused of hypocrisy after he claimed the EU had promised him that no physical checks will need to be erected on the Irish border even if the UK crashes out with no deal.Under the “doomsday scenario”, the Taoiseach said the “commitments of others” would then kick in to prevent a hard border. But Brexiteers leaped on his declaration to insist that has been Britian’s argument all along.Tory MEP Dan Hannan said: “Ireland confirms it won’t put up physical border checks in any circumstances, including a no-deal scenario. The UK has said the same from the outset. So what the hell are we arguing about?”Critics also said Mr Varadkar’s declaration was in contravention of the World Trade Organisation’s rules, which insist on borders between different customs regime being policed. Mrs May visited the Irish border town of Belleek in Fermanagh last night to meet local businesses and hear their concerns.This morning, the PM will deliver a speech in Belfast to call on hard Brexiteers who have rejected her softer Brexit Chequers deal to start addressing the reality on the ground. And she will insist that is their “duty”, as the future of the UK is at stake if they don’t.Mrs May will say: “Our job is not to deal with Brexit in theory, but to make a success of it in practice for all of our people. For all of us who care about our country, for all of us who want this Union of nations to thrive, that duty goes to the heart of what it means to be a United Kingdom and what it means to be a government.”But former Brexit minister David Jones challenged the PM to claim the Irish border issue has been “weaponised” by the EU to get its way in the negotiations.During 2017 there was a five per cent increase in the number of flights operating between Europe and the United States which used Irish airspace.They accounted for almost 501,000 of the total number of commercial flights handled in Irish airspace during 2017.Dublin to London is the second-busiest route in world. Almost 4.5million people flew between the Irish and British capitals last year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The misunderstanding and misinformation surrounding the GRA and self-identification makes everyday life even harder for a group of people already subject to prejudice and abuse.They point out that the Equalities Act is the law that allows trans people to use the facilities appropriate to their preferred gender.So for many years trans people have been using changing rooms, toilets and women\u0027s services such as rape centres - and there is no evidence to suggest that there has been any problem with this at all.The British Social Attitudes Survey, an annual study of public beliefs carried out by NatCen, gave this year\u0027s findings on attitudes to transgender people exclusively to Sky News.In general, the public seem to be liberal with 84% claiming not to be prejudiced at all against trans people."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-ireland-border_4365627.jpg?20180719082223 ","title":"can the pm remould her brexit deal on the potters wheel in fermanagh","story":"No one wants a hard border, but six months from Brexit, there is no plan in place to prevent one.In his resignation statement, the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told the House of Commons the Irish border had become \"politically charged\".He added that the problem of the land boundary \"had hitherto been assumed on all sides to be readily soluble\".When they needed agreement last December, the UK and EU found a solution - a safety net they call \"the backstop\".:: Northern Ireland \u0027unsupportive\u0027 of \u0027no deal\u0027 Brexit The EU understood it meant that, in the event of no deal, Northern Ireland would remain in the customs union.The issue is further complicated by the fact that most people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU.But the DUP campaigned to leave, their MPs vote with the Brexiteers, and the prime minister needs them right now.It is not by coincidence that Mrs May\u0027s visit will take in Fermanagh - Arlene Foster\u0027s own Stormont constituency.If \"no deal\" produces a hard border, it will not be better than a \"bad deal\" for people living here."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-belgium-planes_4366159.jpg?20180719170259 ","title":"exceptional situation as belgium shuts entire airspace after technical glitch","story":"Air navigation service provider Belgocontrol said the issue is a \"very specific problem\" - adding that it was \"no longer sure that all information of flights was correct\".Some planes have been grounded, while others have been prevented from landing.It comes just a day after British Airways (BA) cancelled dozens of flights in and out of Heathrow Airport, with one passenger describing \"complete chaos\" at Heathrow Terminal 5.Long queues were reported as other BA flights suffered delays, with hundreds of passengers told to return to the airport on Thursday only to be warned of \"knock-on disruption\"."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-papers-friday-news_4366405.jpg?20180719220559 ","title":"jimmy mizens parents we made a promise to remain positive","story":"For instance, being woken by Jimmy noisily crashing through the front door after a night out!

The list of MPs currently under investigation has already vanished from Parliament\u0027s website just minutes after today\u0027s decision in the House of Commons. It comes after MPs agreed the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner will no longer name MPs it is investigating - until that investigation finishes. Even then, in some cases the MP may not be named, even if they are found to be at fault. The watchdog probes MPs who are accused of using information for financial gain, having a conflict of interest or damaging the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons more generally.  Until this afternoon there was a current inquiries page on Parliament\u0027s website, which listed the names of MPs who were subject to ongoing probes. But that page has now vanished after MPs agreed the watchdog should no longer routinely publish information about individual investigations before those investigations are concluded. Backers said the move would ensure consistency and fairness because Parliament\u0027s new complaints scheme promises anonymity for both sides.   Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said: We need a clear run at this, so we need confidentiality and we need consistency. But Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said: I think the optics of this house rolling back transparency is deeply deeply worrying. The proposals were backed by all parties. A direct bid to block the shake-up and keep names public was backed by just 22 MPs - while 79 voted not to block it.  Not a single Tory voted to block the shake-up. Twenty Labour MPs, independent John Woodcock and Green MP Caroline Lucas voted to block it. Seventy of the 79 MPs who voted for anonymity were Tories. Five were from Labour, including shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler. Three were Lib Dems and one was from the DUP . Under the new system, all current investigations by the Commissioner will be secret. If only the Commissioner was involved in an investigation, and not the new system, the MP involved will be named at the end of a probe - no matter what. If both the Commissioner and the new complaints scheme were involved, however, it is more complicated. MPs will not be named if the complaint was not upheld and if they weren\u0027t named in the press. Even if the complaint was upheld, the Commissioner will have regard for proportion and the MP\u0027s reputation, as well as any desire for anonymity by the complainant, before deciding whether to publish.

The Work and Pensions Secretary admitted she is working on changes that are still needed to the six-in-one welfare system - five years and a million claimants after it launched. They include more support for the self-employed and possible changes to the taper rate to let people keep more of the money they earn. But she refused to say the system had been flawed - or if she backs ex-welfare chief Iain Duncan Smith\u0027s call to pump in \u0026pound2billion a year more. Mr Duncan Smith made his call after money was sucked out of the system before it launched in a move that will leave hundreds of thousands of families worse off. Asked by the Mirror if her climbdowns showed the system as rolled out was too harsh or brutal, she said: It was very very slow as we rolled it out so we were monitoring as we were rolled it out. So no, it wasn\u0027t, and we\u0027ve stopped and changed it as we went along.  What is right is we continue to learn and change. Some \u0026pound1.5billion was put into Universal Credit to make it fairer at last year\u0027s Budget, and further cash will be approved for people with severe disabilities. But in May Iain Duncan Smith, who held the job for six years before quitting over one benefit cut too far, called for \u0026pound2billion more a year for UC on top of that. Ms McVey avoided saying whether she backed Mr Duncan Smith. Instead she pointed out the cash that had already been put in. In a speech to charities and campaigners at the Reform think tank, Ms McVey pleaded for their ideas to improve the benefit - despite it being in its sixth year. UC\u0027s rollout was blasted by the National Audit Office, pitching her into a public row with the watchdog when she was accused of misrepresenting its findings.  But Ms McVey said: We need to reach out to, learn from organisations such as yourselves, and yes, that includes the National Audit Office, about how to design and implement Universal Credit to support claimants. We want to work with you to understand where we can improve on this important reform. And there are changes that are still needed which I\u0027m working on. Debt repayments, support for the self-employed, payment cycles for those in work, and an extension of outreach work and an extension of flexible support for claimants. Campaigners have warned self-employed workers face being crushed by UC because they are barred from claiming any more benefits than if they earned minimum wage. Ms McVey also signalled she could cut the \u0027taper rate\u0027, the amount of benefit taken away for every pound earned, further after it reduced from 65p to 63p. She said: If we can, yes we would look to reduce that.

When his mum died, it was the iconic I Have A Dream. When he separated from his wife, the bitter-sweet The Winner Takes It All. And now at 71, Clive is still having the time of his life – with their 1976 smash hit Dancing Queen. Said Clive: “Whenever I feel a bit old and achey, I play Dancing Queen and it makes me feel young again.”  For Clive, ABBA has been the name of the game ever since they took the Eurovision Song Contest by storm at Brighton 44 years ago, in 1974. His living room has become a shrine to the supergroup, with more than 850 pieces of memorabilia lining the walls and filling every shelf. And he even named his daughter, now 33, after his favourite member of the Swedish foursome. He said: “She’s named after Agnetha, though we call her Anna. Agnetha is my favourite – there’s just something about her.”  Explaining how his musical tastes met their Waterloo in 1974, Clive said: “I used to think the Beatles were the best band in the world until I saw ABBA on telly. “I said to my then-wife, ‘They’re going to win it’. She looked at me as if I was mad. They won it by a record score of 24 points.” Each piece of memorabilia makes him feel closer to his heroes – whether it is an ABBA soap bar, keyring or signed album cover. He listens to their music almost daily, has danced through 86 tribute gigs and has been on a TV quiz with the group as his specialist subject. He even took their marital breakups as a model for his own.  Painter and decorator Clive, of Scarborough, North Yorks, said: “I watched for signs of animosity between the couples and there weren’t any. “I realised people can get through a split amicably, and that’s what me and my wife have done. We get along just fine. “Whenever I need a little lift, I look through all my ABBA bits and bobs and it takes me back to happy times. “I see a band at its prime and think of the 70s when things weren’t complicated. “There’s an ABBA song that’s helped me through whatever life’s thrown at me.”  Since forming the group in 1972, Benny, Bjorn, Agnetha and Anni-Frid have sold more than 375 million records and had 19 UK Top10 hits. West End show Mamma Mia!, built around their songs, has been seen by 60 million people worldwide and grossed \u0026pound1.5billion. The film based on the show was a global hit 10 years ago and its sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again – starring Cher and Meryl Streep – is released today. Single Clive says if a date did not like ABBA, it would be a deal breaker: “I like to bring up ABBA on a first date. “If a lady said they didn’t like them, that would be our last date. It would never work.”  Seeing ABBA live at Wembley in 1979 was one of his highlights. He said: “It was the best night I’ve ever had. “It was electric. I’m a Leeds United fan and I’ve been to winning final matches – this was even better.” After ABBA gave their last performance as a group in 1982, Clive knew just how to cheer himself up. He said: “I played Voulez-Vous or SOS really loudly, shut the curtains and did a little ABBA dance. I felt uplifted. I still do that today. “The music has universal, multi-generational appeal. It’s one reason they’re the best band in history.” "},{"url":null,"title":"acocks green mum screamed my","story":"NewsAcocks Green mum screamed \u0027my baby\u0027 as carjackers dragged her out of Audi and drove off with newborn girl on backseatClare O\u0027Neill was dragged out of her car and screamed \"My baby!

The two thugs dragged the mum, named locally as Clare O\u0027Neill, out of her Audi S3 before fleeing the scene in Acocks Green, Birmingham. The baby was dumped at a nearby health centre - still in her booster seat - before the carjackers fled. Ms O\u0027Neill, now recovering in hospital, cried My baby! My baby! as stunned neighbours in the cul-de-sac came out to see what the commotion was. Ms O\u0027Neill\u0027s aunt confirmed her niece was the victim of the terrifying incident and said she was still recovering in hospital after being reunited with her daughter.  Neighbour Anjana Chavda, 66, a civil servant, said: I thought they were just kids screaming. I went to my back bedroom window straight away. I saw a lady being dragged by the car. She was holding on to the car as it went down the street. She was clinging on with all her might but she lost her grip. I went into the front window and saw this car going down very fast. It was horrific. West Midlands Police have confirmed the pair have since been reunited after the two suspects launched their attack when she pulled up on her driveway. The force said as Ms O\u0027Neill struggled to get her child out of the grey Audi A3, the pair drove off injuring her in the process. Officers from across the city started a frantic search for the baby and 45 minutes later an ambulance crew at Small Heath Health Centre less than four miles away found the youngster safe and well and still in her car seat.  Force Incident Manager Chief Inspector Tony Cole said: Our primary concern was the safe return of this young child and dozens of officers, including specialist resources, were drafted into the search, which I am so pleased has resulted in her safe return. We are still determined to trace the offenders who have put this mother through a 45 minute nightmare that she will never forget. Please help us with any information you may have which will assist our search. The carjackers remain at large and police are appealing to the public to help find them.

Vila Matautia, 48, knocked Cole Olverson, 15, unconscious and broke his nose, leaving him covered in blood.  The ex-Samoan international admitted repeatedly punching the child, in an assault causing actual bodily harm, reports the Liverpool Echo .  But he said he battered Cole, at the time a year 11 school pupil, because he bullied his son, who was in year eight. Matautia walked free from court today after receiving a seven-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months.  Judge Steven Everett said it was important Cole was not criticised in any way, as there was no direct evidence of bullying. He said: I\u0027m quite prepared to accept that you genuinely believed your son had been bullied and that either the complainant Cole Olverson or one of his friends was the person who had bulled your son. I\u0027m quite prepared to accept that because from what I\u0027ve heard about you, you wouldn\u0027t have carried out this attack unless there was this genuine belief. But the first thing it is important to say, whether there was this genuine belief or not, is this isn\u0027t the way to deal with things.  You don\u0027t take the law into your own hands, which is what you did. You\u0027re a strong powerful man. He is a 15-year-old boy. It was inevitable who was going to come out the worse and that is what happened. You repeatedly punched him to the face. I hope you\u0027ve seen those injuries and seen what you did to that boy. Cole was stood with friends behind the Golden Lion pub in Church Road, Rainford at around 4.35pm, on December 4 last year. Liverpool Crown Court heard he received a Snapchat message from Matautia\u0027s son, asking where he was, but did not respond. Matautia then walked down the side of the pub towards him and Cole, who did not know who he was, asked are you alright?  The boy said he was knocked unconscious and when he came to, was aware Matautia had hit him around five more times. He said Matautia stood over him and said you\u0027re a bully and when asked why, replied: If I find you\u0027ve done anything again, I will cut you. Matautia got out his phone as if to take a photo of the boy lying on the ground. His son was also spotted in the area. Cole suffered a fractured nasal bone, a cut to his nose, plus bruising to his forehead, left cheek and jaw. He still struggles with breathing. Matautia, of Laurel Road, St Helens, was arrested but lied to police during his first interview, claiming he wasn\u0027t at the scene. His mobile phone showed he was and when interviewed again, he said he went there to speak to the boys about bullying.  He claimed another boy pulled a knife on him, that he hit it out of the male\u0027s hand and then punched Cole once, in self-defence. Matautia was part of the Saints side which won Super League, Challenge Cup and World Club Challenge honours in the 1990s and 2000s. Tom Watson, defending, said the prop forward, who has a caution for battery in March 2002, led a rather exemplary life. He said he was sorry, adding: He feels a deep sense of shame and quite frankly, he also feels a deep sense of embarrassment. He is not normally a person who would behave in this way. He knows as well as distressing and upsetting for this young man, he has made a spectacle of himself. That is not the way this man ordinarily lives his life and it\u0027s not the way he is going to behave in the future.  A probation report assessed Matautia, who now works as a self-employed plasterer, as having a low risk of re-offending. Judge Everett handed him a 10-day rehabilitation activity requirement and an indefinite restraining order. He ordered him to pay \u0026pound1,000 in compensation to Cole and \u0026pound400 towards prosecution costs. After the hearing, Cole\u0027s mum, Joanne Olverson, 35, told the ECHO she was disappointed with the sentence and felt Matautia got away with it. Speaking outside of court, she said Cole fell out with Matautia\u0027s son over a minor disagreement, but denied he ever bullied him. She said her friend found Cole, now 16, covered in blood and unable to walk, with his face such a mess you wouldn\u0027t recognise him.  Mrs Olverson said: There is no justification for knocking a child unconscious. Taking a photo of him lying on the floor, that to me was the sickening thing, and threatening to cut him. He\u0027s a good lad and he\u0027s never been in trouble. He had four months off school when his dad died. When he went back to school, it was only part time. After this happened, he was doing a mechanics apprenticeship, he had to stop that and was suffering anxiety and depression.

Shocking photographs show Amey Hogan recovering in hospital after the horror smash on June 26 left her with two fractures to her skull, smashed cheekbones, a shattered and collapsed mouth, broken jaw and nose and damaged teeth. Amey was coming out of her friend’s driveway on her way to school in Ruyton-XI-Towns, Shrewsbury, Shrops, and had entered a blind spot when she was knocked off her bicycle by the passing van. After two weeks in hospital and surgery to fix her broken jaw and cheekbones she has now recovered – but has lost the eyesight in her right eye permanently.  The 11-year-old made a viral awareness video urging other children to wear their helmets – which proud mum Vikki Hogan, 35, didn’t even know about until she realised it had more than 46,000 views online.

Little Kaleigh Lau died peacefully surrounded by her parents and six-year-old brother last month after battling a rare brain cancer .  Her dad, Scott, believes she prepared everybody for her passing by falling into a deep \u0027sleep\u0027 before she took her final breaths. During this time, he says all of her loved ones were able to visit her - and it was only once they had, that she decided time is up. But even on the day she died, Kaleigh\u0027s condition changed dramatically as her gran, aunt and uncle raced down the country to see her.  Despite being up and down in the early hours of that morning, she became stable as her relatives began the heartbreaking journey.  She remained this way until they arrived at hospital several hours later.  Once they had, she quickly deteriorated and passed away. Kaleigh was the ultimate project manager, Scott, 42, told . She was preparing everybody for her death. She was in a sleep and everybody went to visit her who wanted to visit her. That\u0027s when she started to say, \u0027Time is up\u0027. The proud dad, who works as a project manager himself, added that he and his wife, Yang, alerted his in-laws to Kaleigh\u0027s condition on June 12.  After being joined at the hospital by their son Carson and Scott\u0027s mother at 3am, he said they sent a message to Yang\u0027s family in Manchester. They saw the message at 5am, started the journey at 5.30am, he said. Kaleigh was up and down during the night. Her stats became stable until the in-laws arrived at 8.30am, then they went up and down. It was at around 9.20am, less than an hour after her beloved relatives successfully made the trip down South, that \u0027princess\u0027 Kaleigh died. She was one of the longest-surviving UK patients with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), an inoperable paediatric brain tumour. She had been diagnosed with the deadly condition - which affects around 40 children every year and currently has no cure - in April 2016.  At the time, she was expected to live for only nine months. But defying medics\u0027 predictions, the little girl survived for more than two years. Following her death, she was cremated in a lovely service, which was carried out in Kaleigh\u0027s way and attended by hundreds of people. A beautiful celebration of life was later held in her honour. And as well as \u0027project managing\u0027 her own death, the youngster\u0027s family believe she \u0027guided\u0027 them to the perfect spot to bury her ashes. Even looking for her final resting place, she guided us all the way, said Scott, from Woodford Green, East London. We would have never imagined the place we did. Kaleigh\u0027s family had looked around several potential burial sites, but nothing was quite her. They then visited GreenAcres woodland cemetery.  In the corner of my eye, I spotted a tree in the middle of the green. The manager had never even seen that tree, recalled Scott. We said, \u0027Could Kaleigh be laid to rest here?\u0027 His daughter, who was treated at the capital\u0027s Great Ormond Street Hospital, now rests under the tree at the cemetery near Epping. Her ashes are buried near a pond, so she can feed the ducks, and are surrounded by grass moulds, which she can roll around on. It\u0027s so peaceful, she\u0027s the only one on the green, said her dad. We take our picnics down there and sit there to talk to her. Ahead of Kaleigh\u0027s celebration of life, her parents had taken little brother Carson to GreenAcres to show him his sister\u0027s resting place. We took him there before she was laid to rest, said Scott.  He was playing on his tablet and playing around. There\u0027s no sadness around there. It feels like Center Parcs, it feels like a golf course. He added that he and Yang, 38, didn\u0027t tell their son the full extent of his sibling\u0027s condition, saying: We didn\u0027t tell him the severity. He continued: Carson has been undergoing counselling. We told him everybody will go to Heaven one day. We told him his sister has gone off to do another mission - and that \u0027Your sister will always love you and you can talk to her whenever you want\u0027. Kaleigh, who enjoyed being a \u0027princess\u0027 and dancing, was diagnosed with DIPG after she complained of double vision following a cold. Her parents were eating breakfast with her at home when she suddenly laughed and told them that she could see two of them.  Concerned, they then noticed her left eye was turning slightly inwards. After seeking advice from an optician pal, the couple took their daughter to Moorfields Eye Hospital, where her double vision was confirmed. Specialists said the youngster\u0027s eye looked healthy, but told Scott and Yang that she should get checked out at a general hospital. Kaleigh was then taken to the Royal London Hospital, where a CT scan was carried out, followed by an MRI scan five hours later.  They explained the CT scan would happen today, Scott explained in an interview about his daughter with  last year.  But as it was a Saturday the MRI would be done on Monday. When the hospital called for the MRI team to come in that night I knew what they saw on the CT scan wasn\u0027t good. On Sunday, the consultants came round and told us not to worry as on Tuesday they would tell us what the treatment plan would be.  Tuesday came and that was when our world started to cave in and turned upside down. Scott and his wife were left horrified by their little girl\u0027s DIPG diagnosis. When I asked when do they operate, they said they couldn\u0027t, said Scott. When asked what we could do, they said radiotherapy. Once we left the room, we looked it up on the web and the statistics were just something that you couldn\u0027t imagine. He added that although he and Yang were told there was no known cure for the disease, they clung on to any glimmer of hope possible. Kaleigh underwent 30 sessions of radiotherapy followed by an eight-month honeymoond period before her double vision returned. She subsequently underwent a second round of radiotherapy, comprising 10 further treatments in January and February last year.  However, her double vision remained and she began suffering from a weak left hand, stuttering speech and very unbalanced walking. She also started experiencing more regular headaches. Her desperate parents took her to Mexico with Carson last April for intraarterial chemotherapy and immunotherapy experimental treatment. Kaleigh is the first foreign overseas patient in the world to receive this combination of treatment, Scott explained last year. The family returned from the Mexican facility, but flew back a number of times so that Kaleigh could undergo further treatment. This treatment was self-funded, costing tens of thousands of pounds, and still at an experimental stage, with no guarantees. But after the first and second rounds, the youngster was able to swim, do the monkey bars, hop on one foot and perform cartwheels. The size of her tumour was also reduced.  In January and March this year, Kaleigh travelled to the facility again. Her most recent trip was due to take place in May. However, the journey had to be postponed because she was too unwell. We knew that the only chance we ever really had was Mexico, Scott said. Even the day before we were due to fly, I was still adamant that we had to go, but at the last minute we pulled the plug. Kaleigh just wasn\u0027t well enough. The little girl then underwent a MRI scan and blood tests in the UK. The day before she fell into a deep unconscious state, she was still smiling, even giving a thumbs up to the medic taking her blood. But while being checked over by nurses and mummy, she suffered an internal haemorrhage inside her tumour and her heart rate dropped. She spent six weeks \u0027sleeping\u0027 in a coma until she passed away.  Scott said that while he has seen a lot of very cruel ways that children with DIPG pass away, his daughter had a peaceful death. Carson was in the room when she died, he added. Kaleigh was carried to her celebration of life by her doting mum. Her ashes were stored in a small box, featuring the words: Team Kaleigh. The celebration, which was captured in a series of stunning pictures by photographer David Solomans, was attended by 300 to 400 people. Attendees included family, friends, doctors, nurses and Bradley Lowery Foundation co-founder Lynn Murphy, who made a moving speech. It was amazing, just perfect, said Scott. He added that since the ceremony, loved ones have received a lot of signs that his daughter has reached her destination. The little girl loved coin pushers, with one family friend even bringing a machine to her when she couldn\u0027t travel to the seaside anymore.

Ralph Bulger lost his fight to unmask the new identity of Venables after High Court judges threw out his challenge earlier this year. Now he is calling for tougher measures to make sure Venables is properly monitored when he is released from jail to prevent him committing further sex crimes against children. Venables, 35, was locked up for 40 months earlier this year for child porn offences. Eight years earlier he was jailed for two years for similar offences.  Ralph is going back to the High Court to call for tougher measures to ensure he does not re-offend when he is eventually freed. And he wants the probation service to tell the public exactly how he will be supervised. Venables was just 10 when he and Robert Thompson murdered two year old James in 1993. At the age of 18 the pair were released on licence and given secret new identities. Earlier this year Ralph failed in an attempt to have Venables’ anonymity lifted. But now wants the authorities to reveal details of how the 35 year old will be supervised when he is back on the streets. He claimed previous efforts by the probation service had been “shambolic and a joke”. And he added: “Venables should remain in jail for the rest of his life and lose his anonymity but tragically that is not going to happen.  “If we can’t know who he is when he comes out of jail, the authorities have got to show they can manage him effectively and prevent him hurting more children like James.” Ralph’s legal team will lodge papers in the High Court setting out how he wants the anonymity ruling to change. He said: “He will be freed from jail again soon and this time we want to know how the authorities intend to manage him to stop him harming more children. “We also want the authorities in charge of him to be more accountable and the only way we can do that is to alter the secrecy injunction, allowing us more details of how he is being monitored.” Ralph, 52, from Kirkby, Merseyside, hopes the public will support his fight and launched a crowd funding appeal in the hope of raising \u0026pound200,000. “It will be a complex and lengthy legal process and I have asked the public to back us financially to fund our campaign” he said.

The club at Ysgol Y Berllan Deg primary school in Llanedeyrn, Cardiff, has limited spaces for next year. Mums told Wales Online how important it was to them that their child was included with one saying I can’t risk not getting a place, I don’t have a plan B. The breakfast club is a government scheme aimed at providing young children with the opportunity of receiving a free, healthy breakfast at school each day. For many parents with a long commute it is vital as it allows them to drop their kids off early and get to work on time. The school opened its yearly applications for the next school year today and some parents were so worried about missing out they queued through the night outside the school gates.  Have you had a similar experience? Email webnews@trinitymirror   At the front of the queue was Annett Farrow from Carmarthen, whose grandchild goes to the school. “We have been on the road since 1am and got here at 3am,” she said. “My son and daughter-in-law are on holiday so we had to come. If it gets them a place it will have been worth it. “We have bought biscuits and crisps - the only problem is the toilets. We have been using the toilets in the hotel opposite.”  For some parents like Leanne Taylor, who has been in her chair since 3.30am, there is no backup plan. She said: “I have two children, one of whom is starting in reception in September. “I had to do this last year when it did rain a bit. I had only moved into my house two days before and I didn’t have internet. I planned to bring my laptop and do some work while I waited. The police turned up and asked what I was doing.”  According to Leanne there is no other option for her if she wants to maintain her career. She said: “For some it is essential. I work opposite Tredegar House and I drive in. If I drop them off at 8.30 I won’t be getting into work until 10 because of the traffic. “If I didn’t have this I would not be able to go to work- I can’t risk not getting a place, I don’t have a plan B. “It is a really good school and I don’t think there is a fairer way to do it. “To do it you literally have to walk in and hand a form in. They then write what number you were in the queue on the form. “The ones that are here first are the ones that need it most. It gets longer and earlier because the people who did not get a place last year will get here earlier this year.” Another parent, who did not want to be named, said that in previous years it had been slightly different.  “It is a big talking point among parents,” she said. “You get a text two weeks before and then a letter. It goes straight in the diary. I have been doing this for two years and this is the biggest queue I have seen. “I don’t know how a single parent would be able to do it as they would have to bring their children with them. “In previous years people have bought multiple forms for friends and that has been banned because it wasn’t fair on the people who queued up.

Lauren Browne had her weekly shop delivered on Monday when the supermarket worker began chatting to her three-year-old son, Tommy.  After the youngster didn’t respond to the supermarket worker, he asked ‘are you not up for talking today wee man?’ and the 24-year-old explained that her child has autism.  The mum expected to receive one of the usual responses she often gets, which includes a nod of the head or an occasional ‘bless him’ but instead the man found an alternative way to communicate with the tot.  Lauren was surprised when the ‘wonderful gentleman’ treated him no differently and began giving Tommy light items from the shopping to put away. Once all of the products had been stored and Lauren had signed for the order, the kind man then asked the tot to sign for the delivery as well and helped him click the ‘finished’ button. Lauren, from Andover, in Hampshire, said: “I could instantly see that he was a nice person. It was a really sweet moment. “He treated Tommy like a normal person and no different to before he knew he had autism. He wasn’t shocked by it which was really nice. It was lovely for him to be included. “A lot of people don’t really understand it [autism] but he was really lovely. It was quite nice to watch. We don’t really see a lot of people interacting with Tommy on that level.  “I just hope that everybody with additional needs can be accepted for who they are and that more people learn how such a simple gesture can really mean so much to somebody.” Lauren was overwhelmed by the caring man and rang Tommy’s dad, Dan Matthews, 24, immediately after and they decided to use social media to try and pass on their thanks to this mystery person. Lauren said: “When people learn about his autism, they tend to shy away from it and talk to me instead but I appreciate it can be difficult for people. “I don’t think a lot of people are educated in autism. It isn’t really spoken about.” Later that day, Lauren wrote in a Facebook post: “I just wanted to give this lovely man some recognition. “Instead of then ignoring him or being awkward about the news he had just learnt, he found an alternative way to communicate with him and that really means the world to me.  “I\u0027m sure other parents with children who have additional needs will truly appreciate this too. “Unfortunately I didn\u0027t get his name but Mr Delivery Driver, if you see this, we thank you so much for your kindness.” The Facebook post has since received 8.6K likes and Lauren says she has spoken with the Tesco customer service team and was told her gratitude would be passed onto the delivery driver. Lauren said: “I’m hoping he will get the recognition from Tesco that he deserves for being such a gentleman. “It feels absolutely amazing to see that our post has touched the hearts of so many people. The delivery driver really deserves all the praise he has received.

Jessica Xanthe Webb shared an amazing photograph of what remained of her cards - including her driving licence - after they were turned into plastic confetti. A stunned and confused Jessica, from Bournemouth, could not understand why the store took such drastic action. The explanation was that because of new data protection laws, Aldi destroys all cards that are not reclaimed within an hour of being lost. As well as her driving licence, Aldi chopped up her bank card, Tesco clubcard, Matalan card, Superdrug loyalty card, driving licence and even her national insurance number.  Social media users slammed the supermarket chain for such a “dumb” and “awful” policy.  Taking to Facebook on Monday, Jessica wrote: “I realised I must\u0027ve left my purse in Aldi Poole this morning so went back in this evening to ask if they\u0027d found it.  “I was pretty stunned to be handed an empty wallet and an envelope and to be advised that as I hadn\u0027t gone back for it within an hour - they had cut up all of my cards due to the new Data Protection laws. “Questions: Is this legit? If they had to go through my cards to chop them up, could they not have called my bank and asked them to contact me? “Could they not have just put my purse in a safe for the time being? Could they not have waited 24 hours at least? “I’m so confused.” Jessica added in the comments: “It\u0027s just a massive lack of common sense in my opinion. If it\u0027s policy, it\u0027s totally nonsensical.” "},{"url":null,"title":"no wonder double glazing salesmen","story":"NewsLying double glazing fraudster blew profits on designer clothes, private school fees and flights to Las VegasNo wonder the replacement window industry has such a bad reputation - court cases reveal range of lying, cheating, bullying sales tactics\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAndrew Penman07:16, 19 JUL 2018Updated11:58, 19 JUL 2018NewsBoxing fan Zulkernan Mahmood with Floyd Mayweather\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf there are many more cases like these then the double glazing industry will be in danger of getting a bad name. First up is Zulkernan Mahmood, who raked in \u0026pound1.2million a year with his intimidating sales tactics. Despite boasting of a “seamless and problem-free installation every time” on his website, customers were left with shoddy doors and windows fitted by incompetent workers who sometimes left a trail of damage. Mahmood’s reps got customers to pay in full before installation by removing existing windows and demanding the balance “with the implication that the replacement windows would not be installed unless payment was made”, as trading standards officers put it. Other nasty tactics included: *Taking unauthorised payments from customers’ bank cards. When challenged the firm said this was to pay VAT – despite not being VAT registered. *Leaving jobs unfinished. *Ignoring complaints. *Failing to provide safety glass in locations where it was required by law. *Lying about belonging to an industry accreditation body.  Boxing fan Mahmood spent some of the money he made flying to Las Vegas to watch Floyd Mayweather, posting the pictures on Twitter, plus flights to Istanbul and Paris, private school fees and designer clothes. The 30-year-old from Bradford admitted fraud and consumer protection offences following a joint operation by police, trading standards and adult social care workers in West Yorkshire. He was given a suspended 15-month jail sentence and ordered to pay almost \u0026pound65,000 in costs and compensation.  Mike Walsh, prosecuting on behalf of West Yorkshire Trading Standards, told Leeds crown court that damning evidence found during raids on his home and business included a text message in which the shyster wrote: “We’ve become a complete cowboy outlet”. After the trial Linda Davis, head of the West Yorkshire Financial Exploitation and Abuse Team, said: “This case highlights the unfair and fraudulent \u0026shypractices that rogue traders will use against unsuspecting, often \u0026shyvulnerable, consumers.”  Mahmood traded as UKHI Limited, UK Home Improvements and Energy Efficient Double Glazing and previously worked for double glazing giant Safestyle UK, which brings me to the second case. On Monday, in another prosecution brought by West Yorkshire trading standards, Safestyle was fined \u0026pound120,000 in a trial that exposed a dreadful range of bullying, cheating ploys to get work.  In one of the most damning \u0026shyjudgments I’ve heard in a consumer case, Judge Robert Moore told \u0026shySheffield crown court that for two years the firm did not control its staff. “The offences were literally all over the country,” he said. “They frequently involved preying on the more vulnerable and often elderly. “There were lies and forceful calls deliberately wearing customers down. Faulty work was left \u0026shyunrepaired and there was unpleasantness and perseverance.” In one case the rep challenged a reluctant customer to a fight.  In another, when a homeowner objected to an unsolicited visit and pointed to her “No cold-callers” door sticker, the rep said that this did not apply to him “as it didn’t say no cold-calling from Safestyle UK”. An 88-year-old woman was \u0026shypressurised into giving her phone number by a rep who stood with “pen and paper repeating her dialling code”. And an 84-year-old man was told there would be “trouble” if he cancelled after phoning to complain about the cost. Safestyle UK, a trading name of HPAS Limited, admitted 13 unfair trading offences on day two of the trial. The court heard that it now has a new chief executive, Michael Gallacher, and a new chief financial officer. The judge said: “They have a lot to do.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince george pictures young royals","story":"NewsBest photos of Prince George - young royal\u0027s most adorable snaps as he turns fiveThird in line to the throne is already racking up the air miles on royal tours and meeting with foreign dignitaries\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAndrew SnellHomepage Editor16:52, 19 JUL 2018Updated17:05, 19 JUL 2018NewsPrince George in Hamburg in 2017 (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince George has barely started school, but he\u0027s already one of the most famous children in the world. The young royal - who turns five on Sunday - is third in line to the throne after dad Prince William and grandad Prince Charles. And that means he\u0027s already racking up the air miles on royal tours and meeting with foreign dignitaries. He\u0027s also welcomed two younger siblings, as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge expand their family. To celebrate his birthday, here\u0027s the most adorable snaps of Prince George over the last five years. The first picture  Prince George made his first appearance to the public just hours after his birth on 22 July 2013. Proud parents William and Kate showed off their newborn for the cameras as they left the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital in west London.  The prince was christened at the Chapel Royal in St James\u0027s Palace on October 23, 2013.  He was dressed in the traditional gown worn by all royals at their christenings, which is a replica of the robe made in 1841 for Queen Victoria’s eldest daughter.  On tour in Australia  George\u0027s first royal tour abroad came in April 2014, when the Cambridges visited new Zealand and Australia for three weeks. The young prince delighted fans in Australia, and was snapped here at Sydney\u0027s Taronga Zoo where an animal called a bilby was named after him.  There aren\u0027t many people that would show up for a meeting with Barack Obama in their dressing gown. The US President met the future king just before bedtime during a visit to the UK in April 2016. Meeting sister Charlotte  George\u0027s sister, Princess Charlotte, was born 2 May 2015 at the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital. And one of her first visitors was her big brother, who was taken to the hospital by dad Prince William.  A talkative Prince George was seen chatting to his great-grandmother the Queen at his sister\u0027s christening at St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, in July 2015.  The red shorts he wore were a throw-back to the outfit his dad Prince William wore to the christening of Prince Harry 30 years earlier.  With the Red Arrows  Prince George is a fan of planes, and on a visit to the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire he got the chance to sit in one of the Red Arrows. The excited prince was lifted into the cockpit by his dad at the air show in July 2016. Playing with his dog  To mark his third birthday in 2016, the royals released this adorable picture of George playing with his dog Lupo. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have had the pooch since 2012. The photo caused controversy when people saw the young prince was feeding his dog ice cream. On tour in Canada  George went on his second royal tour in October 2016 - this time to Canada.  But the prince was too shy to high-five a young fan he met there.  Schoolboy Daniel Brachman, 9, said: “I tried to high five him but he didn’t want to. Prince George in a helicopter  Prince George got the chance to sit in a rescue helicopter during atrip to Hamburg in July 2017. His dad William was a search and rescue pilot with the RAF for three years.  Starting school is a big step for any child, but George didn\u0027t look nervous as he walked in for his first day at Thomas\u0027s school in West London. The prince was dropped off by dad William in September 2017. Meeting brother Louis  The youngest of the Cambridge children was born on 23 April, and George and sister Charlotte were amongst the first visitors. George was wearing his school uniform as William took him to see new brother Louis at the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital.

So we searched the country and found four SMOPs (Smart Meter Opponents) who revealed their worries to us. We heard the same issues over and over again. Security, inaccurate bills and both home and data safety were all common themes. In a bid to alleviate their concerns and iron out any undue fears, we invited our SMOPs to a round-the-table discussion with an expert equiped to answer their questions.  Audrey Gallacher, from industry body Energy UK, was on hand to chat about topics that were most prevalent on our SMOPs’ minds and to explain the positive impact smart meters can have on their lives, the future and how they could fundamentally save them money. But our SMOPs were armed with tough questions and pushed our expert hard, determined to discover if smart meters really are the way forward. So what did they ask?  Paul, 61, a sales manager from Manchester, said: “I’ve been very concerned about smart meter security and openly sceptical about the real cost saving benefits for a long time.” His feelings were echoed by foster mum Sarah, 50, from Herts. “I’ve always thought they would be more of a hindrance than a help,” she said. But as the conversation evolved and Audrey, Director of Retail Energy Supply, addressed each of our SMOP’s very genuine worries, it soon became evident that despite their initial fears they gradually began to understand how smart meters really could have a positive benefit on their everyday lives.  Paula, 50, who lives with her partner, Ian, 48, and is carer to her elderly and poorly mum Doreen, 80, said: “I really wasn’t sure what to expect but it was encouraging to see Audrey was very receptive to our fairly tough questions.” The mum of one, who lives in a remote area and often has her four-year-old granddaughter Scarlett, to stay was at first anxious about having unknown fitters come into her home. She said: “I was worried about leaving myself and my family in a very vulnerable situation.” Expert confirmed engineers are heavily vetted  Audrey reassured our SMOPs that all engineers are heavily vetted and follow rigorous regulations and guidelines to ensure customers’ safety remains the highest priority. Paula said: “I felt so much better being reassured from someone who works so closely with Smart Energy GB that no fitter would be able to walk in before being fully trained to an extremely high level.” Another common concern was that the initial installation of a modern smart meter would be invasive and time-consuming. Sarah, a busy volunteer, said: “I’d assumed it was a full day’s job and my carpets and floorboards would need lifting that would cause mess and disruption.” She was pleasantly surprised to discover the process only takes approximately two hours and that the smart meters are usually positioned in the same spot as your old meter. Stay-at- home dad, Edward, 27,from South Wales, was still sceptical as to how he could really save money. Smart meter safety code in place  Audrey explained how the data provided on the in-home display indicates when customers are using more than average amounts of energy, allowing them to make changes and assess whether they needed to be using all the appliances causing a surge. She revealed how smart meter customers will be offered competitive tariffs and be able to swap suppliers with ease. Audrey said there is a safety mechanism in place for customers whose energy usage revealed an inexplicable change. The data can indicate to energy suppliers any potential issues, who can then make every effort to fix the problem. Paul, 61, said: “This isn’t something I had even considered and is a real positive for elderly or more impaired customers who maybe hadn’t realised there was a problem. “It’s reassuring to know the energy companies will be watching out for any potential issues.” The conclusion "},{"url":null,"title":"tesco launches refreshing pimms pop","story":"NewsTesco launches refreshing Pimm’s POP ice lollies with alcohol - and just 32 caloriesThe Pimm’s POP comes with an over 18s only warning and checkout staff may ask shoppers for ID before putting the frozen treats through the till\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRuki SayidConsumer Editor19:48, 19 JUL 2018NewsWith an alcohol by volume (ABV) of 4.3%, it is slightly higher than Bud Light (Image: Tesco)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSupermarket chain Tesco is launching an adults only alco-popsicle as the heatwave has sparked a craze for boozy ice lollies.

Louise Brown was dubbed a “test-tube baby” when she was conceived in vitro in a British medical breakthrough that gave new hope to couples who struggled to conceive naturally. She said pioneer Sir Robert Edwards, who was awarded the Nobel prize in 2010 for the development, wanted everyone to have access to the treatment. But an NHS postcode lottery means that while couples in Scotland are guaranteed access to the recommended three cycles of IVF, just 11.5% of clinical commissioning groups in England offer the same – with many giving one, or none at all. Desperate couples living in areas where it is not available on the NHS are relocating to areas with better provision or paying up to \u0026pound8,000 per cycle for private treatment.  Louise said: “It would be good if everyone in the world who needed fertility treatment could get access to it for free or at a cost they can afford. “In reality it varies depending on where you live and what is available to you. That is the same in the UK as it is in different countries in Europe and different areas of America. I know Bob Edwards wanted it to be for all.” The mum-of-two was able to conceive her sons Cameron and Aiden naturally with husband Wesley \u0026shyMullinder, but has said she would have turned to IVF if needed.  Forty years ago, the breakthrough gave her parents John and Lesley Brown the child they had always dreamed of. Louise was born by caesarian section weighing 5lb 12oz at Oldham General Hospital in Manchester on July 25 1978, nine months after Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards watched an embryo divide into eight cells in a petri dish.

Aimmie-Marie Hargreaves, 22, had post-natal depression following the birth of sons Freddie and Theo, an inquest heard. The day before she died, Aimmie had been to the park with her partner Imran Siddique and their children.. Imran said Aimmie had “appeared to be her normal self and was having a good day” although he said she had previously had days where she was “down” and in tears. After visiting the park he left Aimmie with the children to see a friend and several hours later found her in an unresponsive state at home in Halifax, West Yorkshire. He called 999 and started CPR. In a statement, he told the coroner’s court in Bradford: “Aimmie has been suffering from depression for several years which started after our first child was born nearly four years ago. “Her depression then improved and her medication from the doctor was reduced. “We then had a baby in December 2017 and her depression seemed to worsen again. She went back to see her GP and they prescribed Fluoxetine.” Imran said Aimmie’s mood had been the “worst it has been” and she had been crying a lot. During conversations with a GP Aimmie denied having suicidal thoughts and said her children were a “strong protective factor.”  Aimmie’s mum Dawn Hargreaves described her daughter as an “amazing” person who excelled at school and later attended college in Huddersfield and went to university to study midwifery. “She was an amazing mum,” she said in a statement. “She was amazing all the way through school and had lots of friends and was the counsellor of the group. She was very bright and passed everything with ease.” Mrs Hargreaves described her daughter as “truly a gift that we could not keep.” Following her death, blood tests revealed that Aimmie hadn’t been taking her anti-depressants. She had also consumed the equivalent of three pints of beer. A post mortem examination found that the cause of death was hanging. Coroner Martin Fleming, who recorded a narrative verdict, said: “This is a very sad and tragic death. “We have heard from her mother that she was a much-loved daughter and partner who doted on her two children. This has devastated the family, particularly as it has left two little babies without a mother.” "},{"url":null,"title":"young waitress tackles customer who","story":"NewsYoung waitress tackles customer who groped her bum in pizza restaurant - before police arrest him for assaultEmelia Holden, 21, was not going to let the man get away with his actions at Vinne Van GoGo\u0027s pizza restaurant in downtown Savannah, Georgia - and says \"he got what he deserves\"\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByPesala BandaraAmber Hicks15:19, 19 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA 21-year-old waitress at a pizza restaurant gave a customer the shock of his life when she slammed him to the ground after he grabbed her bum. Emelia Holden was sorting out menus when the man walked behind her and brazenly squeezed her rear. Livid by what had happened, Emelia sprung into action, grabbed the man by the neck of his T-shirt and slammed him on a nearby chair before giving him a piece of her mind. Quick-thinking Emelia said: I just did what I felt was best. I took the guy down and had my co-workers call the police. As soon as the cops saw the CCTV footage, they immediately arrested the man. He sat in jail until Monday so in my opinion, he got what he deserved.  All that I want from my experiences is for women to know that it\u0027s okay to stand up for yourself. She added: You have every right to wear what you want and you most certainly have every right to defend yourself. The incident, which happened in a matter of seconds, was caught on CCTV. Police were called to the scene and a man was immediately arrested after cops were shown the footage. The incident took place at Vinne Van GoGo\u0027s pizza restaurant in downtown Savannah, Georgia, just before 11pm on Saturday, June 30.  The man was released on Monday, July 2. The CCTV video begins by showing waitress Emelia taking another table\u0027s order in the patio area of the restaurant. She finishes taking the table\u0027s orders and takes their menus back to the restaurant counter. As she does this, the male customer begins walking towards her. While Emelia sorts out the restaurant menus and order pads, the man reaches his left arm out and grabs her bottom. He then walks away but Emelia immediately chases after him. She grabs him by the back of his red t-shirt and puts him in a headlock- before pushing the man down to the ground.

It\u0027s a call for celebration - but how people choose to celebrate this can vary drastically.  There\u0027s always been a tradition some mothers have chosen to follow after giving birth , whereby they eat the placenta.   Or if they don\u0027t eat it , they might do something else with it.  Some have turned it into teddy bears, some have made Christmas decorations - but now there\u0027s a new trend emerging. Mums are now using their afterbirth to plant trees. Yep, you read that right. But how do they do this? With an invention called a Bios Capsule.    The capsule is a biodegradable conical device in which you put soil and a seed to grow. It is separated into two sections, with room in the bottom to add something special to the mix.  Originally designed to hold the ashes of loved ones (Bios Urn), a company called Happy Birth Tree is now encouraging new parents to add the placenta after giving birth.  Once the placenta, soil and seed are in the urn, you simply plant it and water it just as you would any other plant.

But despite most of cooking it pretty regularly, many will admit to still managing to get it wrong far more often than we should. A top chef has revealed a secret trick which could put the days of burnt saucepans and mushy meals behind us. Australia\u0027s Monty Koludrovic shared his expertise on 9Honey\u0027s podcast What the F is For Dinner .  He says the key to the perfect flurry rice is washing the grains before you cook them.

The men spotted the boy, called Danya, as he climbed onto a table and opened a fourth floor latch while his grandmother was babysitting him. His terrifying 40ft fall was caught on CCTV in the Russian town of Dzerzhinsk. Workmen Dmitry, 47, and Vadim, 30, had just had a break from tarring the road outside the child’s block of flats. One of them told local media: First the head of the child appeared in the fourth floor window.  “Then the legs. We ran under the window and at this moment he fell. We caught him and softened the blow. “He burst into tears, but did not lose consciousness. I called the ambulance.” The shocked grandmother looked out of the window then his aunt rushed downstairs to get the child. The boy was taken to hospital but released soon afterwards with only a bandaged knee. In a separate incident in nearby St Petersburg, a girl aged five was plucked to safety after climbing out of a ninth floor window on an enclosed balcony. The child went out after being left home alone, locked inside the flat while her parents were out. Her feet were supported by a tiny ledge as she clung on for 20 minutes as police and neighbours tried to break into her flat. Industrial climber Felix Gurin, 24, was working on another block carrying out high rise repairs, and heard the girls screams. He rushed to help as neighbours on the ground held a rug with pillows in case she fell. A video showed how he used his climbing wires to descend to the ninth floor from the roof of the building and save the child.

Researchers found three decomposed mummies when they opened the 2,000 year old coffin. The bodies were lying in rancid sewer water in the black granite coffin which is the largest ever found in Alexandria. It was discovered earlier this month and many worried it might be cursed. When King Tutankhamun\u0027s tomb was opened in 1922, a number of people connected with the discovery subsequently died sparking rumours of a curse.  Mostafa Waziri, Secretary-General of Egypt\u0027s Supreme Council of Antiquities, has insisted there is no curse associated with the latest find. He said: The sarcophagus has been opened, but we have not been hit by a curse. We\u0027ve opened it and, thank God, the world has not fallen into darkness. I was the first to put my whole head inside the sarcophagus... and here I stand before you ... I am fine. Waziri said none of the three mummies were members of a Ptolemaic or Roman royal family.  No silver or gold metallic masks, statues, inscriptions or amulets were found inside the coffin, he added. Shaban Abd Monem, a specialist in mummies at the Ministry of Antiquities (MOA), said: “Preliminary examination suggests the skeletons belong to three army officers, one of them his skull shows an injury of an arrow. The MOA said the mummies and coffin will now be taken to Alexandria\u0027s National Restoration Museum where cause of death and the era will be determined. It was announced earlier this week that the MOA would open the tomb using thick pipes to open the lid so they could see inside. Dr. Ayman Ashmawy, head of the Ancient Egyptian Antiquities Sector, said the sarcophagus - built from granite and covered in mortar - was found five metres down. The tomb is nine feet long, five feet wide and six feet tall.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/04/08mgjmorr_9734107-863x575.jpg ","title":"dundee supermarket works with autism charity to launch quiet hour for customers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee supermarket is set to introduce a quieter hour in-store for customers who are sensitive to music and other noises associated with busy shops.Morrisons on Afton Way is rolling out the quieter period every Saturday from 9am-10am.The initiative, dreamed up with the support of the National Autistic Society, has been designed to accommodate people with autism who can find the noisy clamour of shops stressful.Morrisons carried out trials in three stores across the UK earlier this year in order to work out what makes shopping stressful for those with autism and to figure out a time that is convenient.During the Quieter Hour, Dundee’s Morrisons store will have its lights dimmed, its music switched off, the frequency of announcements reduced and a reduction in the movement of trolleys and baskets.Checkout beeps and other electrical noises will also be turned down, and the Quieter Hour will be clearly advertised with a poster at the store’s front entrance.Staff are being briefed on the anxieties customers with autism can face when shopping, in order to improve their understanding of the issues.The National Autistic Society said Quieter Hour was “a step in the right direction”.Morrisons Dundee store manager Colin Thomson added: “Our initial trials showed there is a need for a quieter shopping experience.

We trained twice on Friday so there were heavy legs,” he said.“I think we have to play quicker football, especially in the front.

We think that accounts for much of the increase.“It will likely only be in December, or even January next year, that we can start comparing like-for-like.”Local Jobcentres have made efforts to team up with local employers to offer opportunities to those searching for work.Recently, Tayside branches have been working with ABP Food Group in Perth, 2 Sisters Food Group in Coupar Angus and are making inroads with the Scottish Government to recruit for Dundee’s new Social Security Agency.In addition, Jobcentre Plus staff are laid on at the Central Library to help people with “soft skills” such as IT literacy, writing a CV and attending interviews.Jane conceded that Universal Credit, which is self-managed online, had presented issues for those not IT literate.“For those that struggle with this, we will try to help them,” she said.UK employment is at a record high of 75.7%, according to the DWP.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4c5d1fbe2e3-480x564.jpg ","title":"neil mccann hails super stop from keeper jack hamilton on dundee debut","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann hailed the stopping power of new goalie Jack Hamilton as he claimed a debut clean sheet.By the end of their 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion which started their Betfred Cup campaign, the Dark Blues were cruising to victory.However, with the game at 0-0 and 1-0, the League Two side had chances to turn the game their way.Their best effort came from the head of Jason Marr shortly after half-time but his powerful effort was well saved by new boy Hamilton with the keeper up quickly again to stop the rebound.After that Sofien Moussa added his second of the game before debutant Jean Mendy and Craig Wighton goals capped a good start to the season for Dundee.Boss Neil said: “I’m delighted, absolutely delighted.“I said before the game that this was the season started for real now, there’s no more warm-ups.“First of all, you want to win the game and then, afterwards, put on a bit of a show and score some goals so I’m pleased we did that.“Stirling made it really difficult at times and it took a brilliant double stop from big Jack Hamilton, which is exactly why we brought him to the club. When he wasn’t used that much he makes a super stop at 1-0. We got a wee bit of a jolt and away we went.“I’m really pleased, clean sheet, four goals and the front three scoring – I’m delighted.“We were trying to work the ball through the middle of the park, the boys coming in for their competitive debuts looked good as well so, all in all, I’m pleased.”As well as Hamilton and Mendy, there also were debuts for Nathan Ralph and Elton Ngwatala from the start with the latter replaced by another new boy Karl Madianga.And Neil was happy to see them all make an impact, Mendy especially as he got off to a goalscoring start.“He’s direct and the most important thing for me is he has an end product,” the Dens gaffer added.“His finish was actually brilliant, he reversed it into the corner and you can see he’s got that eye for goal.“He’s really intelligent, he’s not a young boy we’ve brought in or somebody at the twilight of his career – he’s at a real good age.“Elton showed real good glimpses of his power and pace. He’s going to be great and he’s physically able to deal with the game here. Karl came on and showed glimpses as well.

A move up to the top flight only brought a return of six in 23 for Sandefjord before returning to Kristiansund and then getting the big move to Belgium.Manager Neil McCann said he’d been keeping an eye on Mendy’s progress after missing out on him when he departed Norway.He’s finally got his man and the forward is delighted to be at Dundee, even if he’s not spent much time in the city with the club spending a week-long training camp in Portugal.He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time so far, it’s a good club with good players, too, and I think this year will be a good one.“Portugal was a lot of training. That sort of preparation is normal and it was good for us but you feel it when we played the games over there.“We didn’t get the wins in the friendlies, maybe one win against Sunderland but we lost the last two but they were only friendlies – more important is winning the games when the season begins, like Saturday.“It was very good to show we are ready.“There are a few new players, myself as well, and it’s very important for us to get together with the team and start to know each other in training, talk together and know how we all play.“It’s looking good. We’ll obviously continue to work more but I think the season will be good.”After starting off Group D with victory, Mendy and his new team-mates take on Dunfermline at home in front of the television cameras on Sunday.Even if he doesn’t know much about his opponents just yet, Mendy knows the Dundee fans will be expecting a good show from their side and he’s hoping to add to his goal tally.“I’m looking forward to my first home game this weekend.“That will be very important in front of our supporters.“Of course, we want to play a good game, put on a show for the fans and win the game, too.“We are going for a victory.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/Gjen_Lochee_Roadworks.JPG-846x564.jpg ","title":"too much at one time locals claim roadworks on busy dundee street is adding 20 minutes to short journey","story":"\t\t\t\t\tResidents living beside a busy Dundee street are fuming over new roadworks which have left them facing lengthy diversions.They spoke out after Coupar Angus Road was shut to southbound traffic from the South Road roundabout, down Lochee High Street bypass to the junction with Loon’s Road, from July 10.It is the second round of closures for the area, after a section of the same road was closed for a number of weeks.Residents have complained, saying that the work has added up to 20 minutes to their regular journeys.They claim a diversion sign was placed on the road – but had been removed and was now in the nearby Lidl car park.Taxi driver Jim Leaburn, 68, said he was being criticised by customers for taking longer routes to avoid the closure.He added: “They have done too much here at one time. People get in the taxi and they ask ‘why are you going this way?’ and you try to explain but they think you are at it.”James Montgomery, 58, a labourer who lives alongside the road, said: “Getting from A to B is an absolute nightmare just now.“You need to travel twice the distance owing to the diversion.”Councillor Alan Ross, who represents the Lochee ward, said he empathised with locals – but added that the work was essential.He said: “I know that it is frustrating – I am a driver myself.“I share everyone’s frustrations because it has been difficult to get around the area for a while but maybe people can look at planning ahead or working around them.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “These major roadworks will be completed as soon as possible and the project is still within its three-week programme.\u0026#8220We apologise for any inconvenience that has been caused.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f3de751df8-e1531927696691-795x564.jpg ","title":"wheelchair user left stranded on platform by broken lift at new dundee station","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA former MP who uses a wheelchair was left stranded on the platform of Dundee’s brand new train station after the lift broke down.Dame Anne Begg was visiting Dundee from her home in Aberdeen for a meeting.As she arrived at the multi-million-pound station, she was approached by members of staff who told her the only accessible lift had broken down.Dame Anne was born with the rare genetic condition Gauchers disease, which causes her bones to break regularly, and has used a wheelchair since 1984. Initially, staff offered her the opportunity to continue her journey through to Leuchars, from where she would then be driven by taxi to her destination.But due to the short time between her arrival in Dundee and the start of her meeting, she said that alternative was unworkable. As a result of not being able to leave the station, the former Aberdeen South Labour MP said she had no choice but to catch the next train north, missing her appointment.Dame Anne said she was now concerned about provision for disabled people’s access at the new station.She said: “Someone told me it was the second time in the station’s opening week the lift has been out of order. I am quite concerned about how disabled people and those who struggle with stairs and escalators are supposed to be able to leave the platform at this brand new station if the lift breaks. There does not seem to be any proper contingency.”A ScotRail spokesman said: “We’re very sorry to Dame Anne and any other customers who were affected by the broken lift which has now been

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Friday 20 Jul 2018 12:34

suspension bridge linking Bught Road with Whin Island will close this Monday for \"essential repairs\" as part of wider refurbishment of footpaths within the Ness Islands.The move will temporarily cut off access to the beauty spot from the west side of the River Ness at a time when visitor numbers are at their highest.And that decision has sparked questions from puzzled councillors, who have asked why work is beginning now \u0026ndash 13 months after the cash for it was signed off and three months after work elsewhere on the latest phase got underway.They have also criticised the short one week notice period given to the public.Inverness West councillor Alex Graham, said: \"It was very disappointing that [the public] were given such short notice of the work, particularly because it is used as the main access to the Ness Islands from the Bught side [of the river] and of course it\u0027 also part of the Great Glen Way route as well so it\u0027 important to tourists as well as locals.\"I

work?\"Inverness Central councillor Bet McAllister also raised concerns, and highlighted the impact the closure could have on people heading to and from local events, such as the open air Little Mix concert on Sunday, July 29.She added that if the work needed settled weather and low river levels, it could have been carried out months before now thanks to the exceptionally dry spring and summer the Highlands has experienced.\"I can\u0026rsquot understand it,\" she said. \"Why not start in April or early May \u0026ndash they could have had it done.\"I\u0026rsquom not happy with the timing,

They could\u0026rsquove saved lots of hassle if they\u0026rsquod just got on with it.\"Someone probably needs to get their knuckles rapped. It\u0027 such bad timing. If it was that dangerous and bad why not carry out the work before. And if it\u0027 not dangerous why not leave it [to a quieter time]?\"\"They could easily do it in September.\"Highland Council insisted the timing was due to the need for a settled weather window, and that the Monday start date was designed to avoid this weekend\u0027 Inverness Highland Games.A spokeswoman said: \"The council apologises for any inconvenience that this will cause and is mindful of the fact that the closure is taking place throughout the summer, however the works are necessary for the essential maintenance of the bridge and the closure is for public safety.\"The timing of the refurbishment in the summer season is necessary as it provides the best weather conditions to get the work done safely with lower river levels.\"Meanwhile, the council has urged the public to stop attaching so-called \u0026lsquolove locks\u0026rsquo to bridges, and plans to remove any it finds during the repair work. It also called on people not to place stickers on lamps, benches or bridges.\"The padlocks cause rust and both stickers and padlocks damage paintwork,\" they said. \"All existing padlocks and stickers will be removed as part of the refurbishment works and the council\u0027 plea is to leave no trace.\"Friday 20 Jul 2018 12:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"rooney thanks red army after aberdeen exit confirmed1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAdam Rooney has thanked the Dons fans for his four-a-half-years of success at Pittodrie after his move to Salford City was confirmed.The 30-year-old told Red TV:  “I can’t thank the fans enough for what they’ve done.“Not just at the games, but in and around the City and out where we are in Ellon, myself and the family have had a great relationship with them and it’s been brilliant.

But the other side of that is actually having to leave here.“I certainly wasn’t booted out the door. Unfortunately, in football you feel your time comes to an end at certain periods in your career and you have to move on and we felt it was the right time for everyone.“The reason I came here, and I had other options, was to work with the Gaffer.

The trams were burned on the Queen’s Links in May that year with only two cars preserved.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

We thank road users for their patience in advance and encourage them to plan ahead by checking the Traffic Scotland website for real-time journey information.’Real-time journey planning information can be obtained by visiting www.trafficscotland.org or twitter @trafficscotland.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kyles hammer home a win against caberfeidh","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowMarine Harvest PremiershipKyles Athletic returned to Tighnabruaich for the first time this season and they marked the occasion with a 5-1 win over Caberfeidh.Kyles Athletic boss James Perlich was still without the injured Roddy MacDonald, while Andrew King completed a two-match suspension. His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shetland comes to cairndow","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFilm crews were once again spotted in Argyll with the cast of famed BBC series Shetland hot on their heels.After the excitement of Love me to Death filming in Inveraray and Lochgilphead last month, Silverprint Pictures’ made its way to Cairndow to film Shetland\u0026#8217s fifth series this week.The series, which has previously aired on BBC 1, is a dramatisation of the murder mystery novels by Ann Cleeves.Shooting took place on Ardkinglas Estate, inside and outside Ardkinglas House.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"strone point roadworks are completed","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 6:51 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA £1.6m project to improve road safety on the A83 at Strone Point at Inveraray has been completed.Around 370m of carriageway has been realigned and a section of the hillside scaled back, widening the road and improving driver visibility.Drainage systems have been upgraded to improve resilience in wet conditions, and new safety barriers and bike guards have also been installed.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson said: ‘The section of the A83 at Strone Point on Loch Fyne is single carriageway with a history of fatal and serious accidents.

I’d got it into my head the fact that this talk of \u0026#8220health and safety gone mad\u0026#8221 is just silly. We do actually need these things.\u0026#8216When you went into the history of these mines, you could see that we need every safety and health provision in the book because some very nasty things have happened. Even in very small mines, you can get a tunnel that can collapse or a flash flood and that’s possibly the end of somebody.’Marian added: ‘The many different mining ventures throughout the West Highlands in the past were often much more about lining the pockets of speculators than enriching the lives of the local communities.‘Themes of social justice are most important to me, especially when I can show the parallels between past and present lives.’Marian was raised in Glasgow but has hopped all across the globe, living in Perthshire, France, Italy, Lanarkshire and, for the past 20 years, Argyll, contributing with tutoring in English and communications at Argyll College.Journalism took her around the world, covering the effects of conflict and natural disasters on communities, which is evident in her book covering the effect of an often dangerous industry on a community.In terms of looking to the future, Marian is keeping coy. ‘There’s all sorts of ideas going on and I’m hoping to move on with pretty soon.‘I’m doing creative writing courses for the college and that’s actually a great deal of fun because it takes me out of that zone. If you\u0026#8217re supporting people as their talents grow, that is superb and we have very talented writers of poetry and fiction in this area so it’s great to be able to nurture that.’PIC:10 books, probably 10 cakes later. 08_a29marianpallister02Not a Plack the Richer is the story of Argyll\u0026#8217s mining industry. 08_a29marianpallister05Marian Pallister was signing copies of her new book for fans. 08_a29marianpallister06\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrs oldest pub black bull","story":"NewsAyr’s oldest pub, the Black Bull, shuts AGAIN leaving furious staff in wage rowThe Black Bull on River Street was first opened in 1754 and has survived many turmoils in its time, including a blaze that broke out in 2014.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:33, 17 JUL 2018NewsShift manager Charlotte Forsyth, manager Jose Ruiz and barmaid Jade Taylor, with barmaid/ waitress Tori McDicken (front, left) and barmaid Dianne McConnachie (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s oldest pub has shut AGAIN leaving furious staff claiming they have been left out of pocket. The Black Bull on River Street was first opened in 1754 and has survived many turmoils in its time, including a blaze that broke out in 2014. But last Thursday, workers were told mid-shift to collect their belongings and leave, with the tenant having been given no warning of the foreclosure. Now, employees have joined a hospitality union to fight for what they are owed – and their boss has stated “they will get paid”. Day-shift manager, 23-year-old Charlotte Forsyth, was mid-shift when the pub’s owners, Rosemount Taverns, marched in and said they were shutting up shop. Charlotte told the Post: “I was in for about two hours and the head from Rosemount Taverns turned up and said: ‘I need the keys – I’m changing the locks, my joiner’s on his way.’  “I was crying and everything. “I’ve only be there for just over a month and I’ve not been paid a penny. “I still have bills to pay like everybody else. “I would not have left a stable job had I thought that in a month I’d be talking about signing on – it’s not on. Tenant Scott Burnell, of Glasgow, claimed he knew nothing about the decision to close and confirmed staff will receive outstanding wages. Mr Burnell said: “It wasn’t my decision at all – the pub company wanted to (close). “It came as a shock to me – I didn’t know anything about it until after it had actually happened.  “The wages haven’t come through yet – it’s a four-week cycle. “They were paid two weeks ago and they’ll be due to get paid in two weeks’ time – and they will be paid. “I’ll be 100 per cent honest – I’m going to have to find that money from somewhere else.” Furious workers took to social media to vent their anger after receiving information that claimed Mr Burnell had previously outed other workers of a job and money. Mr Burnell denied the claims and said: “I know what they’re saying on Facebook and that is not the case at all. “I don’t set out to rip anybody off – I had no idea that pub was closing yesterday. “Pubs do run into trouble – it happens – I’m not going to run away from this.”  Distraught barmaid and mum-of-two Dianne McConnachie said: “I’ve got children to feed and a roof to put over my head. “I live in a private let with a private landlord so I can be punted out any time. “Myself and colleague Jade are single parents – we’re the only people bringing money into our houses. “So what do we do? Do we go and sign on?” Boss Mr Burnell added: “The pub was closed down because it was losing so much money. “It was a disaster in terms of the administration and financial control of the pub from the management. “I think the level of incompetence and mismanagement was horrific.  “And then we discovered they’d been buying stuff on credit. There’s nothing wrong with that, that wasn’t their fault but I found another \u0026pound4000 in credit that hadn’t been paid for – it was absolutely out of control. “I was told on Friday morning the debt to the brewery was \u0026pound720 and by Tuesday afternoon, it had risen to \u0026pound4000. “It didn’t make any sense. “I’ve got a list of about \u0026pound500/ \u0026pound600 of advances paid out so they were not telling you that. “I know it looks bad for me and I’m prepared to accept that, but it’s not as black and white.”  Bryan Simpson, Unite Hospitality Organiser said: “This is not the first time that Scott Burnell has tried to cut and run with his workers’ hard-earned wages, but it will certainly be the last. “As the Director of Wire Inns, Idlewild and The Raven Hotel, he already owes thousands of pounds to former workers in unpaid wages. “Unite will continue to support our members at the Black Bull to get what they’re entitled to. “We have received assurances from the leaseholders of the pub – Rosemount Taverns – that as soon as they find new tenants for the pub they will endeavour to keep the staff in their jobs.” Rosemount Taverns were unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.

Keith McKissock washes up to 50 properties – many of them businesses – in Ayr town centre. But the dad-of-two faces a stand-off with parking wardens on his tail. Keith, who runs Craigie Cleaning Services, wants a special permit allowing his van into town. But despite offers to pay an annual fee, red tape and fines have dogged his progress. The 53-year-old said: “I’m just trying to go about my work – what I do actually improves the town. “If I wasn’t cleaning these windows, would the council? “I can’t carry 22 litres of water on my back with all my ladders. “Maybe they expect me to balance everything on my bike.”  Keith, once a top Scottish cyclist, was backed all the way by customers this week. Kenny McLachlan, of Ayr, said: “Keith’s been washing our windows for five years and you couldn’t meet a harder working guy. “The High Street needs all the support it can get – we shouldn’t be harassing people doing it a turn.”  Now Tory councillors are  hoping to ride to the cleaner’s rescue by proposing a new parking charter.  Group chief Martin Dowey said: “Examples exist in other councils where they charge an annual window cleaner permit. “Keith is someone who legitimately services our High Street and there needs to be a common sense solution.” Ayrshire’s roads boss Stewart Turner said: “Vehicles can’t remain in the same location for longer than 10 minutes without activity. “In addition, it is not possible to move a vehicle from one bay to another in attempt to buy time. “In Mr McKissock’s case, he can use the bays to undertake cleaning operations but can’t use them to park or collect money from customers. “He was recently asked to move his vehicle from a bay by a parking attendant as he was not carrying out any window cleaning activities. “The Alliance wrote to Mr McKissock, once again, regarding his behaviour towards our parking attendants. “Our employees deserve to be treated with respect and we have a responsibility to protect them.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"former wwe star hurricane tops","story":"NewsFormer WWE star The Hurricane tops bill as Pro Wrestling Elite stages anniversary show at Ayr CitadelPWE will stage their latest extravaganza - and are promising fans one of their biggest and best shows yet.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:03, 19 JUL 2018NewsPWE will stage their big event this weekend (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat this weekend as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

She was one of those selected to appear before the casting directors working on the new Legoland theme park TV and cinema advertisement. Having landed a part, she was cast as an excited youngster exploring the park in the advert. Scarlett, who is a pupil at Troon Primary, had to travel to London for a full day filming session. The theme of the new Legoland campaign focuses on their ‘Deep Sea Adventure’ and Scarlett is seen on board a submarine exploring the ocean and seeing Lego sea creatures swimming around. Scarlett said: “It was a really exciting experience to be involved with the production and I had such a great time.

Our team works with casting directors and producers from the world of TV, radio, cinema and advertising and regularly approach us for casting candidates. “We’ve had students in big campaigns for big brands such as RBS, Legoland, Skoda and Aldi, to name but a few. The involvement gives our students an amazing insight into the behind the scenes production of ads as well as TV programmes, radio shows and movies. We’ve had our students appear alongside real Hollywood big stars such as Rihanna, Nicole Kidman, and Colin Firth as well as music artistes including Kylie Minogue, Rod Stewart and Michael Buble. This amazing Legoland project was a lot of fun to be involved with and even more fun for Scarlett as she’s now starring in it!

A line of four cars all belonging to the same man have hardly turned a wheel for more than a DECADE. The road beneath them is a weed and dirt splattered state, tarnishing the pleasant surroundings of the horseshoe-shaped Raithhill. Every year the forlorn fleet is removed with the help of the AA to ensure they get their MOT and are road legal. And when they are away, a reserve takes their place in case someone else grabs the spot. Last week the story emerged as the cars’ owner Derek Cumming - who runs a chartered accountancy business in Ayr - told police his cars had been vandalised. Police then issued a statement saying the damage had been of “significant financial impact on the owners of these vehicles.” Ayr CID said they are “speaking to the community and reviewing CCTV” and added damage happened between May 1 and June 26. But far from sympathy from residents who insisted the cars were a menace and claimed Mr Cumming couldn’t care less about the annoyance they caused. Neighbours claimed Mr Cumming does not stay in the villa, which was owned by his late mother, and that he lives in nearby Glenalla Crescent. Meanwhile, the cars remain at Raithhill. Usual residents are an 18-year-old silver AUDI TT convertible, two Mercedes SL500’s aged 10 and 11 and usually a Range Rover rather than the 16-year-old Toyota Avensis. On closer inspection there is no significant vandalism to the four cars currently there other than a few minor scrapes and scratches. The Audi and the red Mercedes have small scrapes to the pavement side which look like it has been “keyed.” The Mercedes also has a small panel missing next to the rear window. Residents queued-up to tell the Ayrshire Post of their displeasure. One lady said: “You won’t get any sympathy for him here. Nobody can understand what he is playing at and he doesn’t care he causes us upset.” Another lady added: “In the winter when there is ice it is actually dangerous as we don’t want to hit his cars. “There is grass growing through the tarmac as the council road sweeper cannot get to it. “The so-called vandalism looks nothing to me . . . in fact if that is all there has been in 10 years then he should count himself lucky. “It was his mother’s house and his aunt also used to live there.” And a gent added: “It obviously costs money to keep them road legal and the cars are usually taken away at night so they can get a new MOT. “The batteries are down so the AA has to re-start them. “Three of the cars have private plates and he is doing nothing wrong, but the mind boggles as to why. “Sadly there doesn’t seem to be anything we can do about it but it seems they are there to spite someone and is so infantile. “He once put flower pots down his driveway because he thought neighbours were parking there.” Sixty-three-year-old Mr Cumming runs an accountancy firm in Cathcart Street. This week he was unrepentant he was causing the neighbours stress. Asked why the cars had been there for up to 13 years, he replied: “Because that is my home.” When it was put to him that he actually lived in Glenalla Crescent, he said: “That’s my home. Nothing is bizarre. I do live in the house. “Don’t report anything outwith the police report. “I can park cars legally and that is the end of the matter. I have no further comment.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

2016, according to a report by analysts Mintel.\nHera Crossan, research analyst at Mintel, said: \u0026ldquoThe constant exposure to unrealistic ideals of beauty is having a strong impact on young women, who increasingly report their physical appearance as a factor of stress and discontent.\n\u0026ldquoIt is likely that social media and reality TV shows such as Love Island have helped cultivate an unhealthy obsession with appearance perfection that women feel the need to live up to.\nMoney (41%)      \nWork (32%)      \nPhysical health problems (25%)      \nOverall, 91% of 16 to 24-year-olds have experienced stress in the last year compared with 77% of over-55s.\nBut while stress levels peak among younger consumers, just 4% did nothing to tackle the problem, compared with 23% of over-55s.\nThe top three sources of stress for Britons are money (41%), work (32%) and physical health problems (25%), the poll found.\nMs Crossan said: \u0026ldquoOver-55s may be less likely to report experiencing stress in the last year than Britain\u0026rsquos youngest adults, and indeed have fewer contributory factors, but the proportion who have been impacted by any stress is still high.\n\u0026ldquoWhile cultural changes have meant that under-25s are much more open to talking about their mental health, older consumers are still much more likely to \u0026lsquobottle it up\u0026rsquo, and deal with the problem alone.\nShe added: \u0026ldquoGrowing financial pressure on the side of the NHS and the continued consumer-driven stigma surrounding the practice have meant that Brits are not getting the mental healthcare they need.\n\u0026ldquoVery few adults who experienced stress in the last year spoke to a professional, suggesting that reduced access to medical services could be a hindrance.\n\u0026ldquoHowever, an increase in app-based support and therapy via video conference could help fill the gap in mental healthcare.\nMintel surveyed 2,000 internet

Your Safety. Your Choice.\u0026#8217The Royal Highland Education Trust (RHET) addressed the importance of getting children on farms to find out where their food comes from and that, with the right planning and precautions, they can be safe, fun and educational places.Carole Brunton, farmer and RHET Fife CI project coordinator, is in charge of organising farm visits throughout Fife, making sure that the farms, teachers and children are all ready for a fun, safe and educational experience.Her top tip for having children on farms is: \u0026#8216Common sense and plenty of planning.\u0026#8217Carole said: \u0026#8216For us, farm safety is extremely important. For the children’s safety, for the farmer’s reputation, and for RHET because if we had one accident on one farm it would stop all farm visits. We don’t want that to happen, so we have a strict regime.\u0026#8216We have a risk assessment process that we go through which we do with the farmer before the children are anywhere near the farm. Then we do a pre-visit with the teacher.\u0026#8216We go out with the teacher and the farmer and we do a pre-visit so that everyone knows what’s going to happen on the day when the children arrive.\u0026#8216On the day of the visit the farmer will make sure there’s no dangerous machinery sitting out or there’s not a hole being dug near to where we’ll be. We work closely with the host to make the site as safe as possible.\u0026#8216I would say common sense and supervision are the main things for any farm visit. We don’t want to make it all rules and regulations, so they can’t enjoy themselves. But there must be an element of control. We do tend to let them enjoy themselves and have a bit of fun because that’s the best way for them to learn.\u0026#8216We have a plan for every visit before we turn up, we have a plan of what we are going to do and where we’re going to take them.\u0026#8216Before leaving the farm they wash their hands with antibacterial soap, running water and paper towels, so there’s no contamination. Then they all walk through a foot dip before they leave.\u0026#8217The Royal Highland Education Trust organises fun, safe and educational farm visits for children.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rahs-make-waves-across-the-world","story":"  The band, from Prestonpans, released their latest single Survival through their independent platform EH32 Records last week and have been thrilled by the response it has received.  Lead singer Jack McLeod said the reaction from social media and local radio stations around the world had been amazing.  The band now hope to break through in the USA after independent radio show Passport Approved, which has been credited with helping the likes of Coldplay Muse, Adele and Dido find global success, added the single to its playlist.  The Passport Approved show is played on more than 70 radio stations over six continents, including in major US cities.  Jack said the band was excited about the future and was already planning to head Stateside.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe new single is going down a treat all over the globe!

And Prestonpans Labour Club, which Walter was a member of, has also joined in with recent fundraisers, helping it donate more than \u0026pound1,400 to Pancreatic Cancer Scotland.  Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.

Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.

The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.

Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day. The classical music enthusiast and trumpeter has also worked on a documentary about Felix Mendelssohn and is currently working on one on Fryderyk Chopin.  Now, following his graduation, he can\u0026rsquot wait to get his documentary career under way in earnest.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhilst studying I have been coached and trained by lecturers who are well-known in the industry and it has been wonderful to benefit from their experience.  \u0026ldquoI am now in the process of sitting down with production companies, and looking forward to establishing my own name as a documentary maker.  Dr Kirsten MacLeod, course programme leader, said: \u0026ldquoMatt has been an enthusiastic and committed student who has really made the most of his time."},{"url":null,"title":"archer-statue-comes-to-musselburgh","story":"  The work of art is one of two which now has pride of place in the Honest Toun after a \u0026pound76,000 cash boost from Tesco.  The other is a giant stainless steel mussel shell, depicting Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history, which was recently put in place at Murdoch Green.  Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8046040.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"queen-named-ahead-of-dunbar-rnli-lifeboat-day","story":"  This year\u0026rsquos Lifeboat Queen is 14-year-old Beth Mackay, with attendants Mia Thomson, 11, and 12-year-old Anushka Demer.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

That performance did not come out of the blue \u0026ndash it was the culmination of many years of learning from others and pure hard work.  \u0026ldquoThe week after his victory in Blackpool, he returned to where he started at Inch Park, resplendent in his national champion\u0026rsquos jersey, to meet and inspire our younger riders.  \u0026ldquoHe became a hero figure for many of our Go-Ride members, and some of the coaches too.  The club added: \u0026ldquoThe response on social media to his loss reflects the regard in which he was held. He will be greatly missed by the cycling community in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe pay tribute to his many achievements in his short life and extend our condolences to his parents, Keith and Margaret, sister Emma and girlfriend Hannah.  Scottish Cycling posted on Twitter: \u0026ldquoWe are saddened to hear of the sudden death of Ben Forsyth, a former British youth champion and who at only 20 years of age had so much to live for.  \u0026ldquoOur thoughts are with his family and friends.  Britta Barnet, mum of Ben\u0026rsquos former team-mate Matthias Barnet, said: \u0026ldquoBen was a fantastic young man \u0026ndash very kind and inclusive and a very good friend to our son.  Fellow cyclist Ben Procter said via Twitter: \u0026ldquoDevastated to hear that Ben Forsyth has passed. A champion through and through \u0026ndash both in terms of his cycling prowess and his demeanour.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.

Speaking at the city\u0026rsquos Waterfront Hall, she is due to say that any such deal would go against the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland 20 years ago after decades of conflict.  Mrs May will say that following the publication of the Government\u0026rsquos white paper agreed at Chequers, it is \u0026ldquonow for the EU to respond.  She will add: \u0026ldquoNot simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable. But to evolve their position in kind.  \u0026ldquoAnd, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.  The EU\u0026rsquos other 27 states will have a chance to examine and respond to the white paper when its General Council of ministers meets in Brussels on Friday morning.  They will also receive an update on negotiations from the European Commission\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.  The Irish border issue is one of the most disputed parts of the Brexit negotiations.  In the event of a hard no-deal Brexit, the EU wants a backstop that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea between the island of Ireland and Great Britain, something Mrs May has repeatedly opposed.  The UK Government insists that any backstop position should include the UK as a whole.          I enjoyed meeting @MichelBarnier , discussing the progress we have made, and the outstanding issues to resolve across the Withdrawal Agreement and the Future Framework. I\u0026rsquom looking forward to stepping up the pace and energy in our negotiations. https://t.co/7v0D91sS8I          \u0026mdash Dominic Raab (@DominicRaab) July 19, 2018  Her speech comes the day after new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab headed to Brussels for the first time to take part in talks with Mr Barnier.  Mr Barnier told reporters on Thursday that it was \u0026ldquoa matter of urgency to agree a legally operative backstop, saying: \u0026ldquoWe need an all-weather insurance policy.  Mr Raab said that he was looking forward \u0026ldquowith renewed energy, vigour and vim to seeing the detail of the White Paper hammered out after a gruelling Cabinet conclave at Chequers.  Brexiteer Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom put some pressure on Mrs May\u0026rsquos plan, saying the EU must be told the Chequers blueprint, which has divided the Conservative party, is the \u0026ldquofinal offer rather than an opening gambit.  However she also admitted quitting without an agreement would not be an \u0026ldquooptimal solution.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, meanwhile, insisted the deal is \u0026ldquoabsolutely alive despite the Government being forced to make concessions to Brexiteers.  Mrs May will again refuse to countenance any backstop that creates a divide between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  \u0026ldquoThe economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal \u0026lsquothird country\u0026rsquo customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept.  \u0026ldquoAnd as they made clear this week, it is not something the House of Commons will accept either.  As the EU warns member states to increase preparations for no deal, the Prime Minister is also due to insist that an agreement can be reached with Brussels \u0026ldquothat works in our mutual interest.  She will say the deal will put the UK on the way to \u0026ldquoa prosperous future, protecting jobs and boosting prosperity at the same time as honouring the 2016 referendum result, adding: \u0026ldquoI am passionate about that brighter future and the possibilities that are within our grasp.  Amid the ongoing power-sharing impasse at Stormont, Mrs May is meeting the five main political parties on her two day visit to Northern Ireland, which included her first visit to the Irish border since the Brexit referendum.  She held talks with her Westminster confidence and supply partners, the DUP, on Thursday evening, an engagement that included a private dinner with leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds in Co Fermanagh.  Mrs May also held talks with an SDLP delegation.  On Friday morning she will meet Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionists and Alliance Party.  Ahead of the meeting on the outskirts of Belfast, Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald heavily criticised Mrs May\u0026rsquos handling of the Brexit process.  \u0026ldquoThe British government\u0026rsquos Brexit chaos has been marked by prevarication and stalling, ever changing positions and broken agreements, she said.  \u0026ldquoThis situation is intolerable and unacceptable.

The organisation\u0026rsquos president, Edmund King, said: \u0026ldquoIf your car breaks down your air conditioning might not work either, so make sure you have plenty of drinking water in the car, especially if you have young or elderly family members with you.  Transport data firm Inrix warned that some routes, particularly those popular with holidaymakers, will experience lengthy delays compared with a normal Friday.  Those heading south on the M5 between Gloucester and Devon should expect hold-ups of about an hour and a quarter, while westbound journeys on the A303 between the M3 in Hampshire and A37 in Somerset could take an extra hour.

Spain is the most in demand location while bookings are up for trips to Turkey, Egypt, Greece, Bulgaria and Croatia.  Airports in the South East are expecting a busy weekend with over half a million passengers departing from Heathrow, 250,000 from Gatwick, 148,000 from Stansted and 88,000 from Luton.  Elsewhere, there will be 160,000 people flying from Manchester and 67,500 from Birmingham.  Although the Scottish schools are well into their summer holidays, close to 200,000 people will be leaving from Scottish airports this weekend with 104,000 from Glasgow and 70,000 from Edinburgh.  Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said: \u0026ldquoMany families will be flying out to guaranteed sunshine and the opportunity to experience and learn from different people and cultures.  \u0026ldquoPopular destinations in the UK are also expected to welcome holidaymakers and enjoy the ongoing nice weather."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8095025.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"appearance-related-stress-rockets-among-young-women-survey-reveals","story":"  More than four in 10 women (42%) aged 16 to 24 have experienced stress related to their appearance this year, up from 26% in 2016, according to a report by analysts Mintel.  Hera Crossan, research analyst at Mintel, said: \u0026ldquoThe constant exposure to unrealistic ideals of beauty is having a strong impact on young women, who increasingly report their physical appearance as a factor of stress and discontent.  \u0026ldquoIt is likely that social media and reality TV shows such as Love Island have helped cultivate an unhealthy obsession with appearance perfection that women feel the need to live up to.  Overall, 91% of 16 to 24-year-olds have experienced stress in the last year compared with 77% of over-55s.  But while stress levels peak among younger consumers, just 4% did nothing to tackle the problem, compared with 23% of over-55s.  The top three sources of stress for Britons are money (41%), work (32%) and physical health problems (25%), the poll found.  Ms Crossan said: \u0026ldquoOver-55s may be less likely to report experiencing stress in the last year than Britain\u0026rsquos youngest adults, and indeed have fewer contributory factors, but the proportion who have been impacted by any stress is still high.  \u0026ldquoWhile cultural changes have meant that under-25s are much more open to talking about their mental health, older consumers are still much more likely to \u0026lsquobottle it up\u0026rsquo, and deal with the problem alone.  She added: \u0026ldquoGrowing financial pressure on the side of the NHS and the continued consumer-driven stigma surrounding the practice have meant that Brits are not getting the mental healthcare they need.  \u0026ldquoVery few adults who experienced stress in the last year spoke to a professional, suggesting that reduced access to medical services could be a hindrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, an increase in app-based support and therapy via video conference could help fill the gap in mental healthcare.  Mintel surveyed 2,000 internet users aged 16 and over in February."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8095026.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"30-less-sugar-in-new-version-of-cadbury-dairy-milk","story":"  Cadbury owner Mondelez International described the new bar as the \u0026ldquomost significant innovation in the brand\u0026rsquos history as it unveiled similar sugar reduction plans for other lines such as Oreo and Maynards Bassetts Wine Gums and Jelly Babies products.  The new Dairy Milk bar will sit alongside the original on shelves and offer consumers greater choice and help to manage their sugar intake, the company said.  Glenn Caton, Mondelez International president for Northern Europe, said the science behind the reformulation was a \u0026ldquotrade secret but said some of the sugar had been replaced with fibre to maintain the original bar\u0026rsquos structure and texture.  He described the taste of the new bar as \u0026ldquoincredibly similar to the original, saying: \u0026ldquoIt tastes very, very close to the original but a little less sweet. It\u0026rsquos been tested extensively on consumers and they love it.  Mondelez said a team of 20 scientists, nutritionists and chocolatiers worked for almost two years at its Reading and Bournville facilities to cut sugar without adding any artificial sweeteners, colours or preservatives.  The calorie content remains similar between the two bars, but the sugar content has dropped from 56g per 100g in the original bar to 39g per 100g in the new version.  Mondelez said it would look to apply the approach to other Cadbury Dairy Milk products if it proves successful with consumers.  It also unveiled plans for the next two years to release its Cadbury Boost+ Protein bar with 32% less sugar, 30% lower sugar versions of its Maynards Bassetts Wine Gums and Jelly Babies products and a line of its BelVita breakfast biscuits with 40% less sugar.  Longer term plans include a reformulation of Cadbury Brunch bars to cut sugar by around 20% and a lower sugar version of Oreo biscuits.  Mr Caton said the company recognised that consumers wanted to manage their sugar intake.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur brands have been around for hundreds of years. They are a part of British culture and heritage and play a special role in people\u0026rsquos lives as treats to be enjoyed during a moment of indulgence.  \u0026ldquoTaking sugar out of our products isn\u0026rsquot easy and will take time. Ultimately they are treats and people expect them to taste great, but we\u0026rsquore working hard to find innovative solutions that provide more choice without compromising on their world-renowned taste and quality.  Last month the Government unveiled the second phase of proposals to halve childhood obesity by 2030.  They include proposals to reduce \u0026ldquopester power by stopping supermarkets from displaying unhealthy foods at checkouts, aisle ends and store entrances, as well as stopping products high in fat, sugar and salt from being included in buy-one-get-one-free deals.  An end to sales of energy drinks to children, calorie labelling on menus in restaurants, cafes and takeaways, and the introduction of a 9pm watershed for advertising unhealthy products and similar measures online will also be put to consultation.  Earlier this year campaigners Action on Sugar called for a 20% sales tax on confectionery.  Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore pleased that Mondelez is the latest household name to commit to offering healthier products.  \u0026ldquoThis announcement shows reducing sugar in chocolate confectionery is possible and we look forward to seeing future reductions across more of its confectionery range."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8053922.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"humza-yousafs-thumbs-up-to-hilarious-memes-poking-fun-at-his-official-government-pictures","story":"  The internet has delighted in poking fun at the new Justice Secretary\u0026rsquos official \u0026ldquoserious and \u0026ldquosmiling Scottish Government by satirising them to illustrate good and bad news.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try. You can also purchase bottles of the beers as well as Thistly Cross Cider. If you are looking for presents or something to remember them by, the Brewery shop has a range of clothing, glasses and other items.    The Brewery and shop is open from 10.30 to 5.00 Monday to Saturday during the summer but only to 4.00 in the winter. They generally do not open on Sundays unless a special request has been made.  A large number of establishments on Islay take the ales, either in bottle form or on draught so when you come to visit the island you are sure to be able to find Islay Ales near to where you are staying.  www.islayales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Brander Lodge  Nestled within a scenic and tranquil location, The Brander Lodge offers comfortable and stylish facilities for those looking to relax and explore.

Across the UK, 50% preferred to remain. Those between 18 and 24 were more adamant remainers with three in four wanting to stay in the EU.  In the three way exit deal referendum idea forwarded by former Cabinet minister Justine Greening that would eliminate the least popular option of leaving with a deal in the first round.  After the second preferences of \u0027leave with deal\u0027 voters were allocated, the final result in Scotland handed remain a 66% share and leave with 34%.    The referendum idea was itself unpopular with UK voters, with only 36% in favour of the proposal and 47% against the idea.  The former education secretary argued the final Brexit decision should be given back to the people and out of the hands of \"deadlocked politicians\".  She called for three options to be on the ballot paper: the prime minister\u0027s Chequers deal, staying in the EU or a clean break from Europe with no deal.  The UK is due to leave in March 2019.  Downing Street rejected Justine Greening\u0027s call for a fresh referendum on the UK\u0027s exit from the EU, saying it will not happen \"in any circumstances\".  The poll also found that 60% of Scots thought in hindsight that it was wrong to leave the EU, compared to 46 per cent across the UK.  But 47% of those Scots polled did not think that once the Brexit negotiations were complete and the terms of Britain\u0027s exit have been agreed, that there should be another referendum to accept or reject them."},{"url":null,"title":"university-sacks-priest-who-held-service-for-the-gross-offence-of-pride-glasgow","story":"  Father Mark Morris, of Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church, in Glasgow, invited parishioners on Monday night to a rosary of reparation.  According to the church\u0027s website, the service in Glasgow was a \"Rosary of reparation for the gross offence to God which is Pride Glasgow.\"  Father Morris, who is the Catholic chaplain of Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU), held a service offering decades of the Rosary, Litany and Benediction in reparation for the LGBTQI+ event.  Saturday\u0027s Pride march was led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who called the event \"celebrating and reaffirming the values of tolerance, diversity, equality, love and respect.\"  But now Glasgow Caledonian University has issued a statement saying he won\u0027t return to his post for the new university term in September.  Principal Prof Pamela Gillies CBE FRSE said: \"Following due consultation, Father Mark Morris will not return to his chaplaincy role at the University in September.  \"The University will work with the Archdiocese of Glasgow to ensure the continued provision of chaplaincy support for staff and students at our Faith and Belief Centre when the new term starts.  \"The University is strongly inclusive and committed to supporting equality and diversity on campus.\"  Jordan Daly, Co-Founder of Time for Inclusive Education (TIE), which campaigns for inclusive education in schools, said it was \"sad and disappointing\" to see Father Morris\u0027s \"condemnation\" of the event.  He said: \"The Pride parade was, as always, a vibrant and colourful display of diversity, acceptance, and inclusivity.  \"The ethos of the parade is equality and love, so it is sad and disappointing to see that Father Morris has countered those fundamental values by holding this service and allowing a narrative of exclusion and condemnation to enter the mainstream as a result.\"  Father Morris celebrates Mass on Thursdays in the Faith and Belief Centre in the university\u0027s William Harley Building, and hears confession.  A spokesman for the Catholic Church in Glasgow said: \"This was a private parish devotion unrelated to Father Morris\u0027s role as chaplain.\"  NUS Scotland\u0027s LGBT+ Officer Kai O\u0027Doherty added: \"NUS Scotland is proud to be at the forefront of breaking down barriers facing LGBT+ people.  \"Universities should be a place where every student, regardless of religion, sexuality, or identity, feels accepted and supported to study without fear of discrimination.  \"Everybody within our university communities has a duty to ensure that campuses are compatible with the accepting and progressive culture that they strive to achieve.  \"We\u0027re proud of the progress that has been made, but every day we are reminded of how far we still have to go to achieve a truly inclusive society.\"  Following Ms Sturgeon\u0027s involvement in Pride, a Scottish Government spokesman said: \"Scotland is considered to be one of the most progressive countries in Europe regarding LGBTI equality, and Pride Glasgow is a fantastic event that brings communities together and celebrates all that LGBTI people contribute to Scottish life.  \"As a society we must champion equality and fairness at all times and defend the progress that has been made.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scots-tesla-investor-demands-action-from-elon-musk-for-calling-thailand-diver-pedo","story":"  Mr Musk\u0026rsquos posts on Twitter sparked backlash from shareholders and Silicon Valley analysts\u0026nbspwho called his behaviour immature and an impediment to the car company\u0026rsquos success.

Gamble, from Folkestone, Kent, was also said to have caused the comedian fear and alarm by tracking him down to the Glasgow gourmet coffee shop The Cup and Saucer and also while he visited the city\u0026rsquos Botanic Gardens.  Gamble, 48, was also alleged to have repeatedly approached Boyle and communicated with him while she is also said to have contacted him on social media during her alleged eight-month stalking campaign.  Court papers also stated Gamble repeatedly loitered at the places she knew 45-year-old Boyle would be present, and stare at him.  She was acquitted of the allegations when she appeared from custody at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last Monday but was ordered to be detained under the Mental Health Act for the next six months.  Gamble has spent the past six weeks being psychiatrically assessed at the Orchard Clinic at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital and Sheriff Kenneth Maciver was told a six-month hospital compulsion order was the recommendation of the doctors.  She was also handed a three-year non-harassment order, meaning she cannot contact Boyle in any way either in person or by contacting him by phone, email or on social media.  Any breach of the three-year order could see Gamble end up with a custodial sentence.  All the unwarranted attention was alleged to have taken place between February 1 and September 22 last year.

The controversial funnyman has starred in the popular TV shows Mock The Week, Tramadol Nights and Frankie Boyle\u0026rsquos New World Order.

Simpson had just been charged with killing his ex-wife and her lover.  Twenty years later BBC viewers were treated to a similar show as police swooped on the home of Sir Cliff Richard as part of an investigation into historic child abuse, except the singer had not been arrested or charged with anything.  Now that Sir Cliff has won his case for a \u0026ldquoserious invasion of privacy against the BBC, the corporation is claiming that the ruling marks a significant shift against Press freedom and the public right to know.  They may well be right, but in the BBC\u0026rsquos haste to restore its reputation following the Jimmy Savile disgrace, they and South Yorkshire Police have been the architects of this situation.  What else were viewers likely to conclude seeing aerial pictures of the singer\u0026rsquos home other than \u0026ldquothere\u0026rsquos no smoke without fire, or \u0026ldquohe must have something to hide and all the other assumptions that would come with such a massive effort to cover the story?  Thee is now a huge question mark over all news/police joint efforts, like fly-on the wall documentaries and on-patrol reporting involving anyone who is not found guilty. It won\u0026rsquot just be \u0026ldquoPolice, Camera, Action but in future \u0026ldquoPolice, Camera Action, Lawyer.  Unless this is challenged by an appeal, in England and Wales at least it potentially means the can be no identification of anyone involved in a police investigation until they have been arrested and charged, and then all the other restrictions kick in until a verdict has been reached.  It layers another privacy protection on top of existing safeguards and for the rich and powerful it could be an easy way to prevent any reporting of investigations, and not just sensational cases involving celebrities. Any media identification of people or companies alleged to have been involved with wrong-doing could now claim their privacy is being breached and it could kill investigative journalism stone dead.  The bar of a privacy breach is far lower than that of defamation, as proved in the Naomi Campbell case when she successfully sued the Mirror for breach of privacy in revealing her treatment for drug addiction despite making anti drug statements. Or Max Mosley, the motor racing chief who won his case against the News of the World, despite the story of his involvement in an orgy with five prostitutes being true bar one fact.  For claimants the privacy bar is already low but the over-zealous BBC has, by its own tacit admission, helped lower it further."},{"url":null,"title":"shake-up-in-traditional-party-line-up-may-be-on-the-way-says-vince-cable","story":"  Sir Vince said that \u0026ldquoreasonable politicians from all parties wanted to avoid the possibility of the UK crashing out of the European Union without a withdrawal agreement.

Asked whether he believed a political realignment was coming, Sir Vince said: \u0026ldquoIt does look as if it may happen.  \u0026ldquoThe problem is the Conservative Party is now hopelessly divided in civil war and there is a similar situation in the Labour Party for different reasons.  \u0026ldquoA lot of people in both the major parties are talking openly about breaking away and people outside are trying to encourage it.  \u0026ldquoI think the public generally are fed up with the very dysfunctional nature of British politics.

He acknowledged that his absence from Monday\u0026rsquos votes on the Customs Bill had been \u0026ldquoa mistake, but said Prime Minister Theresa May was saved from defeat by a number of Brexit-backing Labour MPs who voted with the Government.  Sir Vince warned that the risks of a chaotic no-deal Brexit were now \u0026ldquosignificantly higher and accused some Conservative MPs of actively trying to bring it about.  \u0026ldquoIt would be very, very damaging because significant trade barriers would be created, said the Lib Dem leader. \u0026ldquoI think there are people in the Conservative Party who are egging on that outcome and hope to be able to blame the European Commission for it.  \u0026ldquoAll the evidence we have \u0026hellip is that it would be massively disruptive and significant losses would be imposed on the UK economy and the most vulnerable people are often the people in the deprived parts of Britain which voted for Brexit.  \u0026ldquoTen years ahead, no doubt all this would be sorted out, but it would mean we enter a very difficult economic period with significant economic damage.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think reasonable people on all sides of this argument really want that to occur."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8091605.jpg?type=article-full","title":"marys-meals-receives-425000-funding-boost-from-peoples-postcode-lottery","story":"  Scottish-based Mary\u0027s Meals runs feeding programmes in 15 countries to help chronically-hungry youngsters gain an education.

The organisers of the ECI cited Brexit as the reason for submitting the petition and the future possible loss of EU citizenship and rights by UK nationals.  \u0026ldquoThe main objective of the proposed initiative is to guarantee that European citizenship and its associated rights cannot be lost once they have been attained, the Commission said.  \u0026ldquoThe organisers cite in particular the context of Brexit and the future loss of EU citizenship and rights to UK citizens, it added.  A Commission spokesperson said that the decision to register the initiative concerns only the legal admissibility of the proposal and that it had yet not analysed the substance of the petition.    Petitioners will need to get a total of at least one million signatures\u0026nbspthat includes residents in at least seven EU nations.  The Commission can then decide either to back the request or not, and in both instances would be required to explain its reasoning.  The organisers say in the text of the petition that it aims to \"uphold the right of Union citizens to move and reside freely within the territory of member states under objective conditions of freedom and dignity\u0026nbspand to safeguard citizens of the Union from use as bargaining chips in negotiations under Article 50...\"  It requests the Commission \"submit a proposal to retain the rights of EU citizenship for all those who have already exercised their freedom of movement prior to the departure of a members state\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspleaving the Union, and for those nationals of a departing state who wish to retain their status as citizens of the union.\"  The organisers of the move which includes seven nationals from\u0026nbspBritain, France, Italy, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Greece and Belgium say a separate passport\u0026nbsp\"might be issued as a consequence of this\" if the suggestion is approved.  The organisers say: \"Retaining European Citizenship aims to appeal to all citizens of the European Union. Citizenship - and the rights and responsibilities that go with it - should not so easily be stripped away from European citizens.    \"We are concerned with those who wish to retain their citizenship, with EU nationals in the UK who face an uncertain future as a result of Brexit, with UK nationals residing in EU countries and with all those who want to defend their citizenship.\"  EU citizenship guarantees freedom of movement in the EU and other rights  Brits were expected to lose their EU citizenship after Brexit is in effect, either in March 2019 or at the end of the transition period in December 2020.  EU citizenship would not replace British nationality but would\u0026nbspbe additional to national citizenship.  It would grant specific rights such as the right to travel and live anywhere in the EU and the right to vote and stand as a candidate in European and local elections where they are living.  It would also\u0026nbspallows EU citizens to get diplomatic protection and consular help from any EU country wherever they are in the world, even if their own country does not have a local embassy.  The petition asks that people who wish to retain their EU citizenship after Brexit be allowed to do so.  The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - two years after Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the exit process by invoking Article 50.  And Westminster\u0026nbsphas been adamant that free movement would end at the end of the transition period in December 2020.  In a parliamentary answer on the citizenship question, Lord Ahmad of the Foreign Office said \"when the UK ceases to be a member of the European Union, British nationals will no longer hold EU citizenship, unless they hold dual nationality with another EU member state\".  Lord Callanan of the Department for Exiting the European Union said retaining EU citizenship for Britons post-Brexit had not been ruled out, but it \"would involve changing treaties\". \"The other side [EU negotiators] has shown no interest whatever in doing it,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"councils-set-to-be-handed-powers-to-banish-lap-dancing-clubs","story":"  A new licensing regime would hand local authorities greater control over the number of sexual entertainment venues operating in their boundaries.  But women\u0026rsquos groups have called for politicians to go further and implement an outright ban across Scotland such as that introduced in Iceland in 2010.  Cosla, which represents local government and lobbies on its behalf, backed giving councils \u0026ldquothe ability to control the number and location of such venues in their areas.  Responding to a consultation on the proposals, it said it was \u0026ldquovery difficult to see how a commitment to eradicating violence against women and girls could sit alongside the licensing of sexual entertainment venues.  It said current Government guidance \u0026ldquodoes not recognise that working in the sexual entertainment industry is for most people not about choice, but about exploitation, and one in which women are disproportionately represented.  Violence Against Women Partnerships (VAWP) insisted the Scottish Government should work with councils to outlaw lap-dancing clubs.  But venue operators said it was \u0026ldquounfair and untrue to imply that lap-dancing is a form of violence against women.  Brightcrew, operators of Platinum Lace in Glasgow, argued its performers \u0026ldquoare all strong, independent, talented women who choose to work in sexual entertainment.  It added: \u0026ldquoIt is a well-remunerated occupation. It is a form of performance. It provides great flexibility in terms of hours and days of work, meaning that performers can work when they like, ensuring that they can find a balance between their work and other demands on their time, be it family, other work or studies.  The Scottish Government said it would consider the consultation responses before bringing in new rules.  Provisions to create a new licensing regime were voted through Holyrood in 2015 as part of the Air Weapons and Licensing (Scotland) Act.  The legislation allows councils to decide whether they want to licence sexual entertainment venues and set the number able to operate in their area.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoLicensing of sexual entertainment venues does not seek to ban lap dancing or strip clubs but to allow local licensing authorities to decide what is right for their area.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government accepts the freedom of adults to engage in legal activities and employment.  \u0026ldquoHowever, it will continue to promote, through all relevant means, gender equality and actions that tackle out-dated attitudes that denigrate or objectify particular groups or individuals."},{"url":null,"title":"bifab-workers-accuse-bosses-of-ditching-full-time-staff-in-favour-of-agencies","story":"  In a statement addressed to Scottish ministers, they said such a move would \u0026ldquoseriously damage any hope of winning new contracts.  It comes after BiFab ran into severe financial problems late last year, forcing the Scottish Government to step in and broker a deal with new Canadian owners DF Barnes.  Last week, unions warned the yards \u0026ndash located in Fife and Lewis \u0026ndash were now effectively closed with almost no workers left on the sites.  In their statement, the workforce said the new owners had not engaged with union leaders, and were instead seeking to replace experienced staff with agency employees.  The BiFab yards previously had a core workforce of 400 and a further 1,000 contractors.  Scottish Labour\u0027s economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie insisted the claims raised \u0026ldquoserious questions about the SNP Government\u0027s recent handling of the crisis.  She said: \"Trade unions and the workforce deserve praise for their courageous fight to protect jobs.  \"Laying off the highly-skilled core workforce would devastate families and communities \u0026ndash and lead to a loss of skills and experience that would be impossible to replace.  \"The SNP government simply cannot be in a position where it has allowed itself to be a facilitator for making skilled workers redundant and replaced with insecure agency work.  \"That is an outrage and SNP Finance Secretary Derek Mackay must immediately address these reports and take swift action to ensure these skills are not lost for good.\"  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the SNP Government had been \u0026ldquoeasily duped by this company and has now cleared the way for the casualisation of the workforce.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove heard very little from the SNP since they press released saving the yard back in April. BiFab workers are right to feel betrayed.  But a Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe are in regular contact with BiFab \u0026ndash including a meeting between ministers and senior representatives that took place this week.  \u0026ldquoWe have made a long term investment in the company, however we do not participate in operational management decisions.  \u0026ldquoIt was clear at the point new ownership was secured that conditions would remain challenging for the yards and new contracts would have to be won to secure future work.  \u0026ldquoThe workforce played a major role in securing new investment for the yards and the prospect of securing future contracts which DF Barnes is working toward.  \u0026ldquoWe have confidence that everything possible is being done to secure new contracts and restore employment to previous levels."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire economy buzzing with activity","story":"        A range of local business developments which demonstrate the strengths of the area\u0026#8217s economy have been welcomed by Aberdeenshire Council, as a new economic action plan for the area is introduced to reflect a more positive economic outlook.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Friday 20 Jul 2018 12:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming. They still have some way to go with other vacant posts but it is good to see GPs being recruited.\u0026ldquoHaving locums all the time means patients don\u0026rsquot see the same person, but with GPs you have a better chance of continuity.Dr David Carson and Dr Mike Ruse are set to join advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) Colin Armer \u0026ndash a recent recruit \u0026ndash at the Riverbank Medical Practice in Thurso.Dr Herjit Sutherland is to join the Riverview Medical Practice in Wick along with new ANP appointment Vicki Kelly.Mike Flavell, who is giving up his post as NHS Highland\u0026rsquos Caithness district manager, is an advanced physiotherapist and is to begin weekly clinics shortly in the Riverbank and Riverview practices as well as in the Lybster medical practice. He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems. So, in theory, my physiotherapy clinics could help to take 25 per cent off the GP\u0026rsquos workload.\u0026ldquoAnd for people aged over 75, that figure goes up to 38 per cent, so I may be able to provide even more support.Kath Jones, NHS Highland\u0026rsquos associate medical director north and west, said: \u0026ldquoThree Caithness GP practices run by NHS Highland have recently attracted six new clinicians to permanent posts including three GPs, two ANPs and a physio practitioner.\u0026ldquoThe appointment of so many high-calibre clinicians within such a short time is a credit to the quality of the teams working in these practices. The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care. With two of the clinicians moving into the district to take up post, this will be good for the local economy too.Mr Armer has already taken up his post at the practice on Janet Street, Thurso. Dr Carson is due to start in August and Dr Ruse in October.Vicki Kelly is to start her post at the Martha Terrace practice in Wick next week with Herjit Sutherland due to begin work at the end of August.Friday 20 Jul 2018 12:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Friday 20 Jul 2018 12:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went. I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected.

Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful.

This includes security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters, operations officers and passenger service agents.“Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members,\u0026#8221 said Unite regional officer Wullie Wallace.\u0026#8220The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard-working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.“Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Friday 20 Jul 2018 12:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Friday 20 Jul 2018 12:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am. And Dingwall No.1 in Craig Road will be shut from 7am on August 2 to 11am on August 5.Final installation and testing of the new barriers will also require fortnight-long road closures at both sites \u0026ndash Dingwall Middle from October 15 to 29 and Dingwall No.1 from October 29 to November 12.David Dickson, infrastructure director for Network Rail Scotland, said: \"These level crossing upgrades represent a significant improvement for rail and road safety.\"Our consultation work with the local community earlier this year indicated support for these improvements and we look forward to seeing them delivered.\"Our aim is to deliver this work with as little disruption as possible, however, we will require two short closures this summer plus two week road closures for each crossing to install and test the new equipment this autumn.\"Train services are not expected to be affected by any of the works.Friday 20 Jul 2018 12:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Visitors will then be able to access behind the scenes areas of the museum, experiencing objects up close.Curator Dr Karen Buchanan explained: \"We want to make as much of the material in our collections accessible as possible. This includes not only our objects in storage, but also the wealth of archive and library material we hold, which document the history of Gairloch parish. This funding will maximise our storage space, protect our collection for the future and enrich our visitors\u0026rsquo experiences.\"Museums Galleries Scotland is the National Development Body for museums and galleries in Scotland and offers strategic development support to the sector.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known. He is an example to us all.\"Mike is a great colleague but more importantly a great friend to all of us in the Highlands.\"Since their launch of the Utility Week Stars Awards in 2014, the annual event has grown to become the de facto celebration of dedication, ingenuity and teamwork in the UK utilities sector.SSEN picked up another gong, as the SSEN Safety, Health and Environment team won the Health and Safety Initiative award for the roll-out of an influencing behaviours training programme and safety licence across the division.Friday 20 Jul 2018 12:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Friday 20 Jul 2018 12:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre (OGTC) is leading the industry-backed “Facility of the Future” initiative that could halve the cost of developing and operating an oil and gas facility and help to access the equivalent of more than 3.5 billion barrels of reserves in so-called marginal discoveries.            A discovery is classed as marginal when the risks or technology involved make it too challenging to develop economically, for instance because of its geographical location or the specialist equipment needed.            The project wants to design a new approach that will make this process more efficient than traditional methods, such as fixed platforms.It aims to develop lower-cost, reusable facilities that can be remotely operated from onshore control centres, thereby increasing reducing the requirement for staff to work in the hazardous offshore environment and creating skilled onshore jobs. Chris Pearson, the OGTC’s small pools solution centre manager, said: “Oil and gas is playing catch-up with many industries when it comes to automation and remote operations. We’re exploring how the combination of existing and new technology can be best used in the offshore environment to improve safety, reduce life cycle cost and increase efficiency.“New, smarter and more automated ways of developing oil and gas fields are required if we’re to fully unlock marginal discoveries and maximise economic recovery from the UKCS. “The Facility of the Future initiative will help to significantly reduce life-cycle costs and strengthen the investment case for both marginal discoveries and more traditional reservoirs.”            The initiative will kick off with a study led by Crondall Energy and Buoyant Production Technologies to develop a floating facility adapted from the type of installations currently used for shallow water gas fields, known as NUIs, to make them suitable for oil discoveries. It hopes to design an NUI concept that will function at any water depth and uses a minimal manning approach by involving remote control and automation technologies.Niki Chambers, project manager at the marginal development solutions centre, said: “This study is looking at unlocking the capabilities of these floating facilities to work across any kind of discovery. It is opening up the whole of the UKCS.” The OGTC is supported by the Scottish and UK governments, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils and Opportunity North East. It also generates funding from industry and university partners, and is currently in the process of securing further funds for subsequent studies as part of this initiative."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770822.1531988489!/image/image.jpg","title":"business stream looking to make waves with sales and marketing director","story":"        Water supplier Business Stream has hired a sales and marketing director from a rival business.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770715.1531940380!/image/image.jpg","title":"kevan christie judge politicians and officials by ability not bmi","story":"        The public shaming of NHS Scotland\u0026#8217s chief executive and our new Health Secretary \u0026#8211 who were told to quit their bad habits and \u0026#8220practice what they preach\u0026#8221 \u0026#8211 overstepped the mark in terms of intruding into people\u0026#8217s private lives.                No doubt, Tam Fry, chair of the National Obesity Forum, and Glasgow University nutritional expert Professor Mike Lean have enjoyed the 15 minutes of fame that their rudeness brought them.             These paragons of virtue effectively ‘called-out’ Health Secretary Jeane Freeman for allegedly smoking, having previously made an attempt to quit, while NHS Scotland’s chief executive Paul Gray was outed as a ‘fatty’ and told to lose weight.             It’s not my concern if Freeman smokes like a laboratory beagle – as long as she does something about NHS waiting times and delayed discharge. The same goes for Gray. He could go home at night and attach himself to a Toblerone drip for all I care. The important question here is – can he do the job? The calls from music hall double act Fry and Lean mark a worrying trend and do little to quell the sort of body fascism that leads to teenagers developing eating problems. READ MORE: Kevan Christie: Jeane Freeman makes good start as Health SecretaryI wouldn’t hesitate to criticise the Health Secretary on these pages or the chief executive of the NHS for that matter, but would never dream of making it personal by commenting on their habits or appearance. Their personal choices are their own to make.It fair to say both have risen to their posts through a combination of hard work and perseverance. The individuals in question are in key posts that bring a high degree of stress and it could be argued Freeman has the most difficult job in the Scottish Government.             Both are adults and, yes, both will know that smoking and obesity are killers. When they have time during the stressful lives they lead, they are probably trying to change bad habits – who isn’t? But to be subjected to this kind of personal attack, which came out of left field, is preposterous and stuck out like a sore thumb in the current climate of political correctness. Last December, a UK study estimated that one in four nurses are obese, and making a link between the long hours they work and their diet is easy to do. These dedicated health professionals probably eat on the go and are often too stressed and tired to rustle up a low-carb stir fry with extra quinoa. READ MORE: Scots NHS ‘staffing crisis’ as thousands of nurses quit            Fry is on record as saying that “it’s absolutely essential that people in the public eye practise what they preach”. I don’t agree. Granted it would be nice, but we’re in dangerous waters if people start getting employed based on their body mass index as opposed to their ability.In fact, someone like Gray is the ideal person to talk about obesity as he has ownership of the problem and first-hand experience of the difficulties some people face in trying to lose weight.We’re encroaching into similar territory as someone saying for instance, you can’t manage a Premiership football team unless you’ve played at the highest level – but Jose Mourinho has rubbished that kind of thinking. And does anyone seriously believe Freeman is a role model for people to emulate? She’s not Beyoncé.            So, while I agree with Fry and Lean’s central message on health. I feel on this occasion there was no need to shoot the messengers."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4758343.1531948209!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment health service without doctors is not worthy of the name","story":"        An array of different pressures have combined to create a crisis for the NHS in Scotland.                An array of different pressures have combined to create a crisis for the NHS in Scotland.            And one of the most significant is a growing shortage of doctors. According to the Royal College of General Practitioners Scotland, there will be 856 unfilled vacancies for GPs by 2021. And that means potentially life-threatening delays for patients trying to get an appointment and increased pressure on the GPs currently in the job.             Scotland is not alone with many countries around the world struggling to attract doctors, but that is no excuse. If anything, it demonstrates the need to find a lasting solution to the recruitment problem because competition for doctors will only get more intense.It is blindingly obvious that the best way to increase the number of doctors is to train more Scots to become doctors. However, new figures released by the Scottish Government show that the number of Scottish-domiciled students taking clinical medicine degrees at our universities fell to a ten-year low of 2,160 last year, compared to 2,350 in 2013/14.One reason for that is Scottish students face competition for places at medical schools from people from all over the world. Because medicine is a much more expensive course than other subjects to teach, the number of Scots allowed to enrol is controlled by the Scottish Government and international students are a lucrative source of external funds, effectively helping to subsidise the education of Scots.But this could prove to be a false economy. If the number of newly trained doctors fails to keep up with demand, then the recruitment crisis will only get worse. So the Scottish Government needs to take steps to persuade more school pupils that a career in medicine is for them – and they could start by addressing the causes of “GP burnout”, a problem described vividly by one doctor in The Scotsman recently.            But they also need to consider ways to persuade medical students from England, Wales and further afield that they should stay in Scotland after they graduate. During their student years, some may decide they like living in Scotland, but there are surely things that could be done to encourage the idea. Whatever strategy is adopted, Scotland needs to act quickly. It hardly needs saying but a health service without doctors is not worthy of the name."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771358.1532023988!/image/image.jpg","title":"calls for scotland to ban all lap dance clubs in country","story":"        Women\u0026#8217s groups have called for a national ban on lap-dancing clubs as Scottish Government plans to introduce a licencing scheme for sexual entertainment venues took a step forward.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"scott calls on union to allow medical flights during aberdeen airport strike ","story":"Isles MSP Tavish Scott is calling on Unite to allow lifeline medical flights from the isles to continue through a proposed strike at Aberdeen Airport.\nMr Scott has appealed to Unite’s Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, after workers at the Airport voted for strike action in a dispute over pay.\nWorkers at Aberdeen Airport have announced their intention to strike at points throughout late July and August.\nAnd Mr Scott said this would deny NHS patients living in Orkney and Shetland the opportunity to attend scheduled medical appointments in Aberdeen through no fault of their own.\nMr Scott wrote:The strike action would affect not only leisure and business travellers, but also NHS patients travelling from Orkney and Shetland for treatment on the mainland. Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes. Perhaps the collective Governments will make a Coast Guard helicopter available.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brae pool closure extended ","story":"The closure of the Brae swimming pool is to continue until the end of September.\nOriginally, the North Mainland Leisure Centre had been due to re-open this month once repairs were completed to the roof.\nBut due to a delay in the procurement process work is only set to begin next week, with late September now the target for re-opening.\nLocal firm DITT Construction have been appointed to repair the damage suffered during a winter storm last week.

it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nFriday 20 Jul 2018 12:39

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league.

We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27411  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe Occupied Territories Bill - proposed by Senator Frances Black - is expected to pass due to the support of Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Independents and Labour. \nSinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile welcomed the legislation, he said: “Goods and services that are only available because of gross human rights abuses and violations of international law should not be available in Ireland.\n\n\"On a daily basis, Palestinian villages are demolished and residents displaced to make way for the construction of more settlements,” he said.\n\"The international community considers the construction of Israeli settlements as illegal under International law and in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. \n\"An EU report in 2017 outlined that continued settlement building places a great strain on efforts to reach a lasting and just resolution in the region.\"\nSenator Ó Donnghaile described the existence of settlements as a war crime and said the Irish government must comply with diplomatic and economic sanctions against the state of Israel.\n“The Irish government cannot on the one hand condemn these illegal colonial settlements and on the other hand freely trade with them.\n“This is the time for action and to make history.

disturbances that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of parties and organisations, at Fahan Street/Butcher Gate. \nIt follows several nights of disturbances in the area which included a gun attack on PSNI officers, several blast bombs and dozens of petrol

people of the Bogside and Fountain and to send a clear message that there is no support for the violence witnessed over the last week. \nMary Lou McDonald made the comments in the Bogside this

Incidentally, both of those claims were the highest in the 40-member chamber.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f.jpg","title":"65207  ","story":"    \nTHE Department of Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairs believes that the recent sustained spell of hot weather - rather than pollution - has led to the deaths of a number of fish in a section of the Dunore River near Antrim.\nLocal man, James Cousley - who has lived on the Drennans Road\u0026#160 for more than 70 years - was distressed when he discovered the fish in the river, which runs alongside his property.\n\u0026#8220That river has been polluted before, less than two years ago, he said.\nBut after two visits by officials, DAERA was able to confirm that pollution had not caused the fish to die on this occasion.\nA\u0026#160 spokesperson said: The recent warm weather has led to high water temperatures in conjunction with lower base river flows in many waterways and this can have an adverse impact on the fishery and river ecology. \n\u0026#8220It is not unusual for dissolved oxygen levels to drop to critically low levels, particularly at night, which can result in fish mortalities.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a01f.jpg","title":"65208  ","story":"    \nSINISTER footage has emerged of a masked man pointing a gun out the window of a house at a pre-Twelfth Church parade in Randalstown.\nSunday\u0027s annual parade saw brethren from Randalstown District LOL No 22 and members of two local bands taking part in a church service and act of Remembrance.\nAs the bands and the brethren - including young children - made their way down Station Road, watched by spectators, they were unaware of a more sinister set of eyes trained upon them.\nVideo footage, which has spread on social media, shows a man in a beret and camouflage jacket with his face obscured by a scarf and sunglasses, raising what looks like an assault rifle before training it on those marching.\nWatching from a house on the route, he is being filmed as he appears to cock the rifle.\nAs the camera pans back towards the parade going past the house, he points the weapon in its direction before a disturbing \u0027click\u0027 - believed to be the trigger being pulled - can be heard off-camera.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f1.jpg","title":"65301  ","story":"    \nMUCKAMORE Seconds have reached the Ulster Plate final against Ardmore Seconds or Donemana Seconds on August 19.\nAnd the club\u0027s First XI gained more valuable points when they travelled to Stormont on Saturday to play CSNI in their latest Premier League match and completed the double over their arch-rivals in a vitally important game. \nThe fixture marked the debut of new signing Adam McDaid, who has joined this week from North West Club, Eglinton. \nThis weekend Muckamore travel to Armagh seeking a win against the bottom team, which would almost certainly secure the Antrim club\u0027s position in the Premier League next season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f1.jpg","title":"65302  ","story":"    \nANOTHER break between rugby seasons draws to an end this week as Randalstown Rugby Club\u0027s pre-season training begins.\nAfter a 10-week period in which the senior squad had the opportunity to get some excellent strength and conditioning work completed at Ballymena Academy under the guidance of Ryan Keating, the players now return to the pitch.\nThis season, Randalstown will field three senior sides in the Ulster Branch leagues with the First XV in Qualifying League 2, the Second XV in Junior League 3 and the Third XV in Junior League 6.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a04f.jpg","title":"65303  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship will take place in Antrim this weekend.\nTwo hundred young people representing USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain, Republic of Ireland, France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together in the town as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nDuring the week-long contest, 38-foot wooden gigs will be sailed and rowed on Lough Neagh.

She was devoted to the needs of the less fortunate in Romania.  Both her and Samuel travelled many times to Romania thus allowing Barbara to speak passionately at home in Northern Ireland at many events and meetings. At the same time Barbara was busy fundraising, filling and organising containers to be transported out to Romania with all kinds of essential supplies and gifts and was still finding time to help Samuel on their farm.\n\nBarbara inspired many others in the community to travel out to Romania to help the people there in any way they could and see for themselves the need that Barbara so passionately spoke of back home.\n\nBarbara was a people’s person and this was certainly borne out by the large attendance at her funeral at Toberdoney Presbyterian Church last Monday and all those who paid their fitting tributes having travelled from near and far.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBarbara’s passing has left a huge void for her husband Samuel, her father Jim, brother Robin and sister Alison, nephews, nieces, wider family and all who knew her. She was predeceased by her mother Grace.\n\nThe charity ‘Smiles’ has also paid tribute to Barbara on its website.\n\nIt said the Smiles Family is now one less, adding: “It is hard to imagine life or Smiles without her’ but we thank God for the amazing legacy of achievement that Barbara leaves, for what she meant to so many and look forward to continuing the work in Romania which Barbara so passionately loved and supported.”\n\nThoughts and prayers go out to Samuel and the family circle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8571942.1531923675!/image/image.jpg","title":"children s charity to benefit from ni open","story":"\nThe Northern Ireland Open, which takes place at Galgorm Castle from August 15-19, has selected Cancer Fund for Children as its official charity partner for 2018.\n\n                \nThe local charity will benefit from the tournament next month, which will see 156 European Tour golfers take to the course, as well as an extensive schedule of events and activities away from the fairways to entertain all the family.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAs well as selling the official programme for the NI Open, the charity will benefit from a range of events including an Ambassadors Q\u0026ampA Evening on August 14 in the Braid, and the Pro Am Dinner, following the Pro Am Day on August 15.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFunds raised from the tournament will enable Cancer Fund for Children to provide a range of practical, emotional and financial support to families affected by cancer, to help them cope with its impact on their lives.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe Taylor family from Ahoghill are just one local family who have benefitted from the charity’s support, after their 12-year-old daughter Molly was diagnosed with cancer in 2014.\n\nMum Lisa said: “When Molly was diagnosed with cancer, it was a massive shock.
