However, he refused to name the man.The ringleader has previously been named by the country\u0027s Prime Minister as Moulvi Zahran Hashim, and extremist preacher known to security services for speeches he gave online calling for all non-Muslims to be \u0027eradicated\u0027.Mr Wijewardene also confirmed that a blast at a cinema in Colombo today was a controlled explosion carried out by police. He said officers had approached a suspicious motorbike outside the cinema and tried to open its storage compartment, but when the lid got stuck they decided to blow it up. Among the Britons killed were GP Sally Bradley and her husband Bill Harrop, 56, a retired firefighter, who died when the Cinnamon Grand Hotel was bombed. Dr Bradley, sister of peer and former Labour MP Keith Bradley, had been living with her husband in Australia since 2013 but they were due to return to Britain to retire in the Cotswolds.         Expat British IT worker, 55, who was last seen eating breakfast in hotel targeted by Sri Lankan suicide bomber is feared to be final UK victim of the atrocityBy Inderdeep Bains and Neil SearsA British IT director was feared dead last night after she was last seen having breakfast moments before a suicide bomber struck at a hotel buffet in the Sri Lanka terror attacks.Lorraine Campbell, 55, from Manchester, is the last of eight British victims caught up in the atrocities on Easter Sunday to be named, her son said last night.The mother-of-one, who had just arrived in Colombo on a business trip, had been staying at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel - one of three 5 star hotels targeted by suicide bombers.Her devastated son Mark Campbell, 32, told the Mail: ‘I have been told it is her although she has got to be formally identified. I know it is my mum. She has been taken from us in a terrible way.’         British IT director Lorraine Campbell, 55, from Manchester, was the eighth British victim killed in the atrocities to be namedShe was last seen alive on CCTV footage having breakfast with colleague Juno Srivastava at the hotel’s Taprobane restaurant - where she was said to have been sat ‘very close’ to the blast site.The successful businesswoman had relocated to Dubai to work for a large firm last year with her husband Neil Evans who has flown to Sri Lanka to try to find her.A suicide bomber - who had checked into the hotel the night before the attack as Mohamed Azzam Mohamed - had waited patiently in line at the breakfast buffet with a plate in hand.An employee at the hotel, who had reviewed CCTV footage, said: ‘He had a couple of servings before he came right to the centre of the restaurant and blew himself up.’Dhivya Marunthiah, who is a volunteer helping in the search for missing people, said: ‘Both Juno and Lorraine were sat very close to the blast area.‘Footage from inside the hotel shows them having breakfast together near to where the bomb was detonated in the moments before.‘We have been looking for Lorraine and Juno for two days.’       Mr Campbell, who lives in Stalybridge, Manchester, said his mother had been anxious about travelling to the island ahead of her fateful visit.He said: ‘She had messaged me before the trip to say she was nervous about flying there because of Dengue fever.‘She was quite worked up about it but I told her she would be all right. I never thought something like this could happen.‘Mum was amazing. She touched everyone she met and all those people now have a huge hole in their lives.’ He added: ‘I saw her only a couple of weeks ago when she came back for Mother’s Day which was really nice.‘She had only been in Sri Lanka for a day for work. I think her company had some dealers or suppliers she needed to meet.’Mrs Campbell, who married husband Neil in Liverpool last February, had been with Mr Srivastava a ‘loyal friend’ who works for her at Al Futtaim - a firm which runs malls across the Middle East.The Indian national - who also lives in Dubai and is a lecturer at Middlesex University’s Dubai campus - was still missing last night.Mr Campbell said his mother remarried in February last year after finding ‘everything she ever wanted’ in business man Neil.‘Mum never thought she would get married again but she met Neil who was everything she wanted in a man - smart, intellectual and successful in his own right.‘He gave up his business career here to start a new life in Dubai with Mum. They had a three year plan to make some money tax free and then come home to enjoy life,’ he said.Mr Campbell, who works in music management, said: ‘Mum was a strong woman.

The introduction of the measures has resulted in a safer village for all.\u0027Similar speed cushions were introduced in other areas of the county without issue.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Man claims ghost haunts bed webcam filmed floating head pulling sheets","story":" In the black and white footage, a figure seems to pull the sheets above her father\u0027s head, as he kicks out. It then pulls them back down before seemingly disappearing, it is claimed. The bed sheets can be seen ruffling throughout the video, although the grainy footage makes it difficult to see the supposed ghost.          The webcam captured a \u0027ghost\u0027 pulling the man\u0027s bed sheets up and down as he slept in his room         The man who recorded the video said that he had seen someone \u0027sitting on his bed at night\u0027 and so he set-up the webcam to capture themHowever, viewers on Reddit were skeptical of the ghost claim.  One wrote: \u0027Yeah that’s definitely just the dad rolling over.

Photograph: Air CorpsFacebookA radical transformation in how upland landscapes are managed is needed given the latest wild fires that devastated habitats across Ireland, according to the Irish Wildlife Trust (IWT). IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty said “years of neglect and poor management have left our hills largely barren and part of the problem in the fight against climate change and species extinction. They should be part of the solution, but only a radical change of vision can turn things around.”In a welcome move last year, the Department of Agriculture confirmed farmers with burned land would not be eligible for the single farm payment, he said. “While we have had reports that this has led to a reduction in fires in certain areas, clearly the message is not getting through to all, or other factors are at play.”Whether the latest spate of fires – in Donegal, Clare and Down – was caused by farmers clearing land, acts of carelessness or wanton vandalism, it was now apparent that only a transformation of how mountain and peatland areas were managed would get on top of the problem, he said. “Habitats and wildlife populations in these areas have already been devastated through years of annual wildfires, along with inappropriate plantation forestry and land drainage. This means the vegetation that does exist dries out quickly, leaving it especially vulnerable to out of control fires,” Mr Fogarty said.These landscapes should be wildlife rich, carbon sinks, naturally holding water and places of high scenic and amenity value. “Instead they are carbon sources, lead to flooding and pollution and have few resources for wildlife.” IWT called for farmers and landowners in such areas to be given greater options for their land. These should include being allowed re-establish permanent, native woodlands payments for not farming, incentives to move away from sheep and towards cattle-rearing and large-scale restoration of peatland habitats through drain-blocking and rewetting.He added: “We also need to see greater public awareness of the threat fire poses to public and environmental health as well as the penalties to be incurred from breaking the law.”He cited research published last week, which provides the science behind growing calls for a “global deal for nature” as a companion agreement to the Paris climate accord. “This calls for increasing protected areas to 30 per cent of the land (in Ireland the figure currently stands at around 12 per cent) and an additional 20 per cent as ‘climate stabilisation areas’, particularly through peatland and forest restoration.” The UN has announced 2020 will see the start of a decade of ecosystem restoration as an “unparalleled opportunity for job creation, food security and addressing climate change”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3869556.1556100508!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vote funicular and driverless shuttle for the phoenix park have your say","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe OPW wants to capitalise on the park’s existing attractions, such as Dublin Zoo, the Ashtown Demense and the Magazine Fort, along with developing new facilities to attract more visitors and improve access. Photograph: Pat LanganDublin’s Phoenix Park is facing its most significant change in decades, with plans for new visitor attractions including a funicular, a driverless shuttle-bus, and a train station, proposed by the Office of Public Works (OPW).The OPW wants to capitalise on the park’s existing attractions, such as Dublin Zoo, the Ashtown Demense and the Magazine Fort, along with developing new facilities to attract more visitors and improve access.It also wants to reduce the dominance of car traffic in the park which is “not appropriate, nor indeed safe” and has a “significant negative impact on the amenity value of the park”, but it is careful not to propose curbs.The Phoenix Park Visitor Experience Strategic Review, which is open for public consultation until Friday, April 26th, ides the park into five different areas.Meanwhile, the Magazine Fort in the south of the park is branded as the “commemorative quarter” while Chesterfield Avenue, the long straight road bisecting the park has been called the “central line”.Two “welcome pavilions” have been proposed for the Parkgate Street entrance to serve as visitor information centres and “may also glow in the evenings, as lanterns, to summon people, perhaps out of an autumn drizzle” the OPW said.The main visitor centre would be at the Ashtown Demesne, where the current cafe could be redeveloped as a children’s education centre, and a larger cafe, toilet facilities and visitor centre would be built, as well as the possibility for extensive “discrete” car parking facilities.The zoo entrance facilities could also be expanded, and the tea rooms and bandstand near the zoo could be upgraded. A train station on the underground Phoenix Park rail line which runs from Heuston Station could also be located to the east of the zoo.The bioersity quarter, which takes in Fury Glen and the White Fields at the west end of the park would see the least intervention, but there could be scope for development of the existing pavilion near the Knockmaroon gate as a bioersity centre. It could be “tripled in size” without being over developed the OPW said. Toilets and an upgraded picnic area with a possible “organised barbecue” space could be located here. Barbecues are currently banned in the park.The biggest changes are likely to be seen in the commemorative quarter focused on the Magazine Fort. This old military structure could be refurbished with exhibition facilities, a shop and cafe, a rampart walk and moat walk, but could also incorporate a funicular which would run to the Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge on the other side of the river Liffey.The central spine of Chesterfield Avenue could be dotted with playgrounds and temporary and permanent art installations and outdoor exhibitions. However its principal function would be to act as a public transport route to discourage people from taking cars into the park. The OPW proposes a “driverless shuttle” bus or “road train” carrying 15 passengers at a time. Such a system which was “almost science fiction a relatively short time ago has now become a readily achievable reality” it said.While the OPW does suggest new parking areas, it is keen to reduce through traffic and “tame” the use of the park for commuter parking it said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Patrick Quirke has pleaded not guilty to murder of Bobby Ryan, known as Mr MoonlightCourt hears boy \u0026lsquodid not feel like he had any options\u0026rsquo and was relieved garda\u0026iacute arrivedCarer says she has to fundraise to pay for physiotherapy of son with rare genetic conditionNasa mission to the red planet detects and measures a likely \u0026lsquomarsquake\u0026rsquoVigil held in Derry to coincide with funeral of Lyra McKee in belfast\u0026lsquoWhy did it take murder of a young woman for politicians to act?\u0026rsquo priest asksIrish Wildlife Trust says habitats and wildlife devastated through years of annual wildfiresMinister speaks to hospital management after reports of dead bodies left on trolleysGarda\u0026iacute appeal for information on aggravated burglary in Co LouthGroup linked to New IRA had participated in military-style marchesDrugs with estimated value of \u0026euro715,000 discovered during west Dublin operation\u0026lsquoThreats to us as workers are likely to emerge during this process,\u0026rsquo conference hearsMinister says teachers have lost \u0026euro15m in payments - as much as \u0026euro2,000 per teacher - over strikeTrain station on underground rail line from Heuston could be located east of zooDodds says murder brought \u0026lsquopalpable sense of real grief, shock and anger\u0026rsquoLarge crowds expected at St Anne\u0026rsquos Cathedral for journalist\u0026rsquos funeralCorpses were let decompose, making closed-coffin funerals unavoidableGroups are still \u0026lsquoleagues behind\u0026rsquo jihadis and the far-right on use of digital, research findsStudy finds global investors have entered the Irish primary care centre market \u0026lsquobecause it offers relatively high profit opportunities\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3870182.1556112887!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"twitter account of dissident group saoradh suspended","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe @EireSaoradh account was suspended by Twitter.The Twitter account of dissident Republican group Saoradh has been suspended, following the murder of Derry-based journalist Lyra McKee. Saoradh is believed to be the political arm of the New IRA, the group that has claimed responsibility for the killing of Ms McKee last week, while she stood with other bystanders watching rioting in Creggan, Derry. Saoradh says it is a standalone political organisation, but it is viewed as reflecting the views of the New IRA. On Wednesday, Saoradh’s Twitter account was suspended by the social media company, however the organisation’s Facebook page was still active. Commenting on the suspension of Saoradh’s account, a spokeswoman for Twitter said “We have clear terms of service in place which we enforce when violations are identified.”When asked what section of the platform’s rules had been violated by the account, the spokeswoman refused to comment further. In the days following the murder of Ms McKee several calls were made by other users of Twitter, to lodge complaints with the platform over Saoradh’s account. The funeral of Ms McKee was taking place in St Anne’s Cathedral, Belfast on Wednesday, with President Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, and British prime minister Theresa May due in attendance.. In a statement given to the Irish News using a recognised code word, the New IRA admitted responsibility for the killing, and offered “full and sincere apologies” to family and friends of Ms McKee. The New IRA is an amalgam of armed groups opposed to the peace process and it recently claimed responsibility for parcel bombs sent to London and Glasgow in March.Speaking after the shooting of Ms McKee, chairman of Saoradh Brian Kenna, said members of the group believed they were resisting an “incursion by crown forces”, during rioting in the Creggan area. He said Saoradh was a standalone organisation that “had no hand, act or part” in the murder of the young journalist. In the aftermath of the killing, friends of the 29-year-old journalist protested by leaving red handprints of paint on the walls of a Derry office used by Saoradh.Following the shooting, Saoradh cancelled an Easter Rising commemoration parade planned for Derry on Monday, although it did hold a parade in Dublin on Saturday, with some of its members marching in paramilitary garb.Around 200 members and supporters attended the march down O’Connell Street, wearing berets and sunglasses. The march was widely condemned by all corners of the political spectrum, with Mr Varadkar calling those who attended the parade “beneath contempt.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3869697.1556053838!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who are the new ira and what have they done","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Graffiti that has been amended to read “IRA are done.

Photograph:Paul FaithAFPGetty ImagesThe New IRA was established in 2012 when members of the Real IRA, Republican Action Against Drugs and a number of independent republicans came together.The formal admission by the group on Tuesday that it killed Derry-based journalist Lyra McKee caused no surprise, even if its defence of its action infuriated many.It is the most dangerous of the dissident republican groups, made up of young inexperienced members and those old enough to have been involved in violence during the days of the Provisional IRA.While just seven years old it had blood on its hands long before the Creggan shot, being responsible for numerous gun and bomb attacks and the murders of two prison officers in the North.David Black (52) was shot dead as he drove to work in Maghaberry Prison in Co Armagh in 2012, while Adrian Ismay died 11 days after a bomb exploded under his van in Belfast in 2016.The New IRA also wields a degree of control in republican areas, and has carried out many so-called “punishment” attacks.In 2016 taxi driver Michael McGibbon (33) died after he was shot three times in the leg in such an incident in Ardoyne, north Belfast. He bled to death after one of the shots severed an artery.In advance of the formation of the New IRA some of its members are believed to have been involved in the 2011 murder of PSNI officer Ronan Kerr in Omagh, and two years earlier in Antrim in the murders of British soldiers Patrick Azimkar and Mark Quinsey.It has also targeted many more PSNI officers with gun and attempted under-car booby trap bomb attacks. A number of police officers have been forced to move home as a result of such incidents.In January 2017 it wounded a police officer aged in his 20s when it fired up to 10 shots from an automatic weapon at a filling station on the Crumlin Road in north Belfast.Given the danger that attack posed to the wider community, just like as happened in the Creggan, PSNI chief constable George Hamilton called it “crazy” and “completely reckless”.Parcel bombsIn January it carried out a car bomb attack outside the courthouse in Derry. The New IRA also said it was responsible for sending parcel bombs to London and Glasgow last month.Security sources say that it has a store of the high explosive Semtex that they believe was “siphoned off” from old Provisional IRA stock.Since the killing of Lyra McKee, Saoradh has come into public focus in a way it did not do so before, particularly in the wake of Easter commemoration marches in Cork and Dublin.It says it is a standalone political organisation, but it is viewed as reflecting the views of the New IRA, a connection it did little deny with the paramilitary trappings on view in O’Connell Street in Dublin on Saturday.In recent years the New IRA superseded Oglaigh na hÉireann as the most lethal of the dissident organisations. The latter was involved in many gun and bomb attacks, but it is believed not to have claimed lives.It carried out a car bomb attack that severely injured PSNI officer Peadar Heffron in 2010, and the same year was behind the car bomb attack on the British army’s Palace Barracks in Hollywood, Co Down, which houses MI5’s headquarters in Northern Ireland.In 2009 it was involved in a failed 400lb car bomb attack on the headquarters of the North’s Policing Board in Belfast.Its effectiveness was severely curtailed when its leader and long-standing republican Seamus McGrane was arrested in 2015, three years later receiving an 11½-year prison sentence at the Dublin Special Criminal Court for directing terrorism.Oglaigh na hÉireannIn January last year Oglaigh na hÉireann said it was suspending “all armed actions against the British state” with immediate effect.Oglaigh na hÉireann was itself a splinter from the Real IRA which was involved in the 1998 Omagh bombing which killed 29 people including a woman heavily pregnant with twin girls. While still said to be in existence, its effectiveness and level of threat is seen as now limited.The oldest of the modern-day splinter republican paramilitary groups is the Continuity IRA, which was formed in 1986 following a split with the Provisional IRA. While dangerous in its early years, it is now viewed as weakened and heavily infiltrated."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3870342.1556118073!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"possible quake on mars detected for the first time","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhoto made available by Nasa shows the InSight lander’s domed wind and thermal shield, which covers a seismometer. Photograph: NasaJPL-Caltech via APNasa’s robotic probe InSight has detected and measured what scientists believe to be a quake on Mars, marking the first time a likely seismological tremor has been recorded on another planet, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California reported on Tuesday.The breakthrough came five months after InSight, the first spacecraft designed specifically to study the deep interior of a distant world, touched down on the surface of Mars to begin its two-year seismological mission on the red planet.The faint rumble characterised by JPL scientists as a likely marsquake was recorded on April 6th, the lander’s 128th Martian day, or sol.Scientists are still examining the data to determine conclusively the precise cause of the signal, but the trembling appeared to have originated from inside the planet, as opposed to being caused by forces above the surface, such as wind, JPL said in a news release.“We’ve been collecting background noise up until now, but this first event officially kicks off a new field: Martian seismology,” InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt said in a statement.The tremor was so faint that a quake of the same magnitude in southern California would be virtually lost among the dozens of tiny seismological crackles that occur there every day, JPL said.The April 6th rumble on Mars stood out because the surface of the red planet is extremely quiet in comparison with Earth.The size and duration of the marsquake also fit the profile of some of the thousands of moonquakes detected on the lunar surface between 1969 and 1977 by seismometers installed there by Nasa’s Apollo missions, said Lori Glaze, planetary science ision director at Nasa headquarters in Washington.No estimated Earth-magnitude equivalent was immediately given for the apparent marsquake.Three other possible seismic signals were picked up by InSight on March 14th, April 10th and April 11th, but they were even smaller and more ambiguous in origin, leaving scientists less certain they were actual marsquakes. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"notre dame ablaze pictures","story":"A huge fire has consumed Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris.Officials in Paris said the fire, which started around 7pm local time, could be linked to renovation works being carried out at the cathedral. French media reports, citing police sources, added that the fire started by accident. Brexit latest news: Theresa May warned against holding crunch vote on Brexit laws as Labour says it still opposes PM\u0026#39s dealDonald Trump accuses UK of spying on his 2016 campaign, reigniting row with GCHQLyra McKee: Priest calls for \u0026#39new beginning\u0026#39 in Northern Ireland as Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn join mournersHuman rights judges could force British embassies to handle asylum requests, warns Geoffrey CoxSri Lanka suicide bomber who studied in UK is named as Abdul Lathief Jameel MohamedNicola Sturgeon backs off over indy ref 2 demand now but hints Jeremy Corbyn would allow itInside a royal rift: what\u0026#39s really going on with William and Harry?James Holzhauer versus Jeopardy!: how a professional gambler beat America’s biggest game showSri Lanka attack victims: IT director from Manchester killed in hotel bomb blastLimit screen time to an hour a day for under 5s with none at all for under 2s, WHO says  Comment: Trump\u0026#39s visit to the UK should be a wake-up call for Britain\u0026#39s declinist, complacent eliteMichel Barnier fears Nigel Farage and his aim to destroy the EU as Brexit Party surges in pollsTfL forced to remove strawberries and cream from Wimbledon advert after it fails to follow its own junk food rulesExmoor hotel being investigated after holding group sex and swingers partiesSri Lanka suicide bomber \u0026#39studied in the UK\u0026#39, defence minister announces as death toll rises to 359Could it be Zara, Eugenie, or the Clooneys - who\u0026#39s in the running to be Baby Sussex\u0026#39s godparents?Comment: There\u0026#39s no way we can trust the tech arm of the Chinese state to run our communicationsRoyal baby name: print off the \u0026#39s sweepstake and playWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

The industry dominates the economy, generating $28.14 billion in 2016-2016 – a figure that represented a staggering 70 per cent the country\u0027s entire export earnings. However, only 150 of these factories are owned by women. Men typically hold the middle management and leadership positions while women – who make up 80 per cent of the workforce – work on the factory floors. Huq\u0026#39s appointment as president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association has been met with \u0026#39a lot of opposition\u0026#39It is an imbalance that Huq is keen to address.“I walked into one of our factories a couple of years ago and I asked why do I only see male supervisors, where are the female supervisors?” the association president told The , in her first interview since her ground-breaking appointment earlier this month.“They said, Madam, they don’t want to become supervisors because it’s a lot of responsibility. So, I went down to the factory floor and said how many of you want to be supervisors and nearly all of them raised their hands.”It is an attitude Huq is all too familiar with, for her appointment as president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association has been met with a “lot of opposition.”Opposition has not come from those who question whether she possesses the necessary experience after all Huq is the managing director and chairman of the Mohammadi Group, which owns lingerie, sweater and woven garments factories all over Bangladesh and employs some four million people. Huq has already established herself as the standard-bearer for improving working conditions for women in Bangladesh’s garment factoriesInstead, socially conservative and radical Islamic groups disapprove of women in Bangladesh being allowed to work at all, let alone occupy leadership roles.“Whether the pressure is going to be worth taking, I don’t know, but I want to set a standard for women and tell them that anything is possible,” Huq said.She has already established herself as the standard-bearer for improving working conditions for women in Bangladesh’s garment factories.In 2014, she set up a ground-breaking two-year access course and undergraduate degree for women working in factories at the Asian University for Women in Chittagong. The first cohort will graduate in 2020 and enter into leadership roles in factories.“When people ask me if I am excited about my presidency I’m actually not,” Huq said. “I’m more excited about watching the first garment workers graduate next year. For me, that is going to be some moment.”The new president, elected by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association in early April, now plans to introduce several other policies to transform employment opportunities for women in the garment industry.Huq speaks to the largely female workforce inside one of Mohammadi Group\u0026#39s garment factoriesHer experience with the Mohammadi Group led her to conclude that “every second house” in Bangladesh possesses a woman producing textiles.Huq argued that these freelance designers are ultimately held back from expanding their businesses by a lack of capital.“Our Central Bank has a rule that at least 10 per cent of credit has to be given to women but in reality it is something like two to three per cent,” she explained.The president plans to introduce a National Credit Portal, so that entrepreneurial women can directly connect with banks to obtain necessary loans.She will also introduce a female-to-female mentorship scheme in Bangladesh so the nation’s scarce but growing network of businesswomen can inspire and advise others.While female employment rates have improved – from four per cent in 1974 to 33.9 per cent in 2015 – she admits the country still has a long way to go.Huq\u0026#39s experience with the Mohammadi Group led her to conclude that \u0026#39every second house\u0026#39 in Bangladesh possesses a woman producing textiles“The quest is to find a way to re-skill and upskill women and I don’t know whether it will be possible in such a short time, but I believe the journey must begin,” she said.But as well as female empowerment, safety concerns are at the top of Huq\u0027s agenda. In 2013, when the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka collapsed killing more than 1,100 people, many of the dead were crushed as they worked in the building’s garment factories.The horrifying incident shone a light on adverse working conditions in Bangladesh and as a result international firms with factories in the country agreed to sign the Accord on Fire and Building Safety.In accordance with the Bangladeshi government, the agreement permitted regular independent inspections in factories and a range of safety upgrades for workers.Accidents still occur, but they do so less frequently. According to a report by New York University\u0027s Stern Centre, 71 workers died annually in Bangladeshi factories before the Rana Plaza incident. Since the Accord was signed, that figure has fallen to 17. Bangladeshi rescue workers search for survivors amid the rubble of the collapsed Rana Plaza building in 2013But the continued presence of Accord safety inspectors in Bangladesh is under threat. Representatives were due to leave the country in November 2018, but filed a petition to extend their presence. The Supreme Court will decide the outcome on May 19.According to Huq, the Accord’s presence has been very positive, but she believes that the organisation should now make “a graceful exit from Bangladesh.”Instead, the president intends to set up her own monitoring practices following a consultation with Accord representatives to understand remaining safety issues.“They can then move on to other countries in the region like India or Pakistan,” she argued. “These places also have similar accidents but Bangladesh is always hogging the spotlight and I don’t think that is fair.”Huq said the industry has worked hard to improve factory safety, under the terms of the Accord, but added that more can still be done.“The Accord had around 1,900 factories under its jurisdiction, my point is what happens to the rest,” she said.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleHuq added that there must be greater transparency inside the 745 factories currently under government control, as well as other small, shared facilities which fell outside the Accord\u0027s authority.She said an incident in one of these less visible factories could spook investors across the entire Bangladesh garment industry.“If there are isolated cases we should be able to deal with them instead of someone picking that story up and turning it into a huge headline,” Huq said. “That is not how we want to become a headline. I want to hit the headlines with a good story of how this sector is positively impacting women in Bangladesh.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Brexit latest news: Theresa May warned against holding crunch vote on Brexit laws as Labour says it still opposes PM\u0026#39s dealDonald Trump accuses UK of spying on his 2016 campaign, reigniting row with GCHQLyra McKee: Priest calls for \u0026#39new beginning\u0026#39 in Northern Ireland as Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn join mournersHuman rights judges could force British embassies to handle asylum requests, warns Geoffrey CoxSri Lanka suicide bomber who studied in UK is named as Abdul Lathief Jameel MohamedNicola Sturgeon backs off over indy ref 2 demand now but hints Jeremy Corbyn would allow itInside a royal rift: what\u0026#39s really going on with William and Harry?James Holzhauer versus Jeopardy!: how a professional gambler beat America’s biggest game showSri Lanka attack victims: IT director from Manchester killed in hotel bomb blastLimit screen time to an hour a day for under 5s with none at all for under 2s, WHO says  Comment: Trump\u0026#39s visit to the UK should be a wake-up call for Britain\u0026#39s declinist, complacent eliteMichel Barnier fears Nigel Farage and his aim to destroy the EU as Brexit Party surges in pollsTfL forced to remove strawberries and cream from Wimbledon advert after it fails to follow its own junk food rulesExmoor hotel being investigated after holding group sex and swingers partiesSri Lanka suicide bomber \u0026#39studied in the UK\u0026#39, defence minister announces as death toll rises to 359Could it be Zara, Eugenie, or the Clooneys - who\u0026#39s in the running to be Baby Sussex\u0026#39s godparents?Comment: There\u0026#39s no way we can trust the tech arm of the Chinese state to run our communicationsRoyal baby name: print off the \u0026#39s sweepstake and playWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"marsquake detected first time nasa says","story":"Nasa has detected a probable Marsquake for the first time.The suspected seismic event on the Red Planet was recorded using silicon sensors developed in the UK.Nasa said the measuring of the quake, which occurred on April 6, marked the birth of a new discipline - Martian seismology.Chris Skidmore, the science minister, said it was a testament to the UK’s world leading science and engineering space sector.Professor Tom Pike of Imperial College London, leading the UK contribution, said: This is what we were all waiting for, the first quivering of the planet picked up by our sensors.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress for Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignBrexit latest news: Theresa May warned against holding crunch vote on Brexit laws as Labour says it still opposes PM\u0026#39s dealDonald Trump accuses UK of spying on his 2016 campaign, reigniting row with GCHQLyra McKee: Priest calls for \u0026#39new beginning\u0026#39 in Northern Ireland as Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn join mournersHuman rights judges could force British embassies to handle asylum requests, warns Geoffrey CoxSri Lanka suicide bomber who studied in UK is named as Abdul Lathief Jameel MohamedNicola Sturgeon backs off over indy ref 2 demand now but hints Jeremy Corbyn would allow itInside a royal rift: what\u0026#39s really going on with William and Harry?James Holzhauer versus Jeopardy!: how a professional gambler beat America’s biggest game showSri Lanka attack victims: IT director from Manchester killed in hotel bomb blastComment: Trump\u0026#39s visit to the UK should be a wake-up call for Britain\u0026#39s declinist, complacent eliteMichel Barnier fears Nigel Farage and his aim to destroy the EU as Brexit Party surges in pollsTfL forced to remove strawberries and cream from Wimbledon advert after it fails to follow its own junk food rulesExmoor hotel being investigated after holding group sex and swingers partiesSri Lanka suicide bomber \u0026#39studied in the UK\u0026#39, defence minister announces as death toll rises to 359Could it be Zara, Eugenie, or the Clooneys - who\u0026#39s in the running to be Baby Sussex\u0026#39s godparents?Comment: There\u0026#39s no way we can trust the tech arm of the Chinese state to run our communicationsRoyal baby name: print off the \u0026#39s sweepstake and playWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"north koreas kim jong un arrives russia summit putin us nuclear","story":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived in the Russian city of Vlaostok on Wednesday for a summit he is likely to use to seek support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Pyongyang\u0027s nuclear talks with Washington remain in limbo.The armoured train carrying Kim on his first official visit to Russia pulled into the quayside station in Vlaostok, on the Pacific Ocean, a few hours after crossing from North Korea into Russia.After a brief delay while the door of Kim\u0027s carriage was lined up with a red carpet laid out on the platform, the door opened and a smiling Kim stepped out.A red carpet was rolled out to meet Kim\u0026#39s trainEarlier, at a stop on the border, Kim told Russian state television he was hoping for useful and successful discussions with Putin.I hope that we can discuss concrete questions about peace negotiations on the Korean peninsula, and our bilateral relations, he said through an interpreter.Kim will sit down for talks with Putin on Thursday at a university campus on an island just off Vlaostok. It will be the first summit between the two leaders, and the standoff over Pyongyang\u0027s nuclear programme will top the agenda, according to a Kremlin foreign policy aide.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived in Russia for a meeting with Vladimir Putin on WednesdayThe meeting comes two months after a summit in Vietnam between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump ended in failure, leaving the North Korean leader looking elsewhere for international support and relief from sanctions.For Putin the summit is an opportunity to show that Russia remains a major global player despite being under sanctions itself over its intervention in Ukraine and allegations that it meddled in U.S. elections.But analysts predicted that Kim is unlikely to emerge from the summit with any substantial promises of sanctions relief. The meeting is likely to focus more on showing camaraderie.Kim was pictured smiling as he stepped off the trainVlaostok is located a few hours from the Russian-North Korean border by rail, Kim\u0027s preferred mode of international transport.On arrival in the city, the North Korean leader reviewed an honour guard of Russian troops in a square in front of the train station, with bodyguards looking on. He removed his black fedora while a military orchestra played first the North Korean national anthem, then the Russian anthem.After officials from the Russian and North Korean delegations exchanged handshakes, Kim climbed into a black limousine and drove off. About 10 North Korean security guards in black suits jogged alongside the vehicle for about the first 100 metres (yards) of its journey.Russian media reported that Kim would be heading to Russky island, linked by bridge to the mainland part of Vlaostok, where the summit will take place and where he is also expected to be staying.Artyom Lukin, a professor at Far Eastern Federal University in Vlaostok, said Kim would want to be seen as a world leader who has international interlocutors besides Washington, Beijing or Seoul.As for Russia, the Putin-Kim summit will reaffirm Moscow\u0027s place as a major player on the Korean peninsula. This meeting is important for Russian international prestige, Lukin said.Putin held a summit in 2002 with Kim Jong-un\u0027s father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, who also met in 2011 with Dmitry Medvedev, the Putin lieutenant who was then Russian president.Brexit latest news: Theresa May warned against holding crunch vote on Brexit laws as Labour says it still opposes PM\u0026#39s dealDonald Trump accuses UK of spying on his 2016 campaign, reigniting row with GCHQLyra McKee: Priest calls for \u0026#39new beginning\u0026#39 in Northern Ireland as Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn join mournersHuman rights judges could force British embassies to handle asylum requests, warns Geoffrey CoxSri Lanka suicide bomber who studied in UK is named as Abdul Lathief Jameel MohamedNicola Sturgeon backs off over indy ref 2 demand now but hints Jeremy Corbyn would allow itInside a royal rift: what\u0026#39s really going on with William and Harry?James Holzhauer versus Jeopardy!: how a professional gambler beat America’s biggest game showSri Lanka attack victims: IT director from Manchester killed in hotel bomb blastLimit screen time to an hour a day for under 5s with none at all for under 2s, WHO says  Comment: Trump\u0026#39s visit to the UK should be a wake-up call for Britain\u0026#39s declinist, complacent eliteMichel Barnier fears Nigel Farage and his aim to destroy the EU as Brexit Party surges in pollsTfL forced to remove strawberries and cream from Wimbledon advert after it fails to follow its own junk food rulesExmoor hotel being investigated after holding group sex and swingers partiesSri Lanka suicide bomber \u0026#39studied in the UK\u0026#39, defence minister announces as death toll rises to 359Could it be Zara, Eugenie, or the Clooneys - who\u0026#39s in the running to be Baby Sussex\u0026#39s godparents?Comment: There\u0026#39s no way we can trust the tech arm of the Chinese state to run our communicationsRoyal baby name: print off the \u0026#39s sweepstake and playWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 24 april 2019","story":"Police move in on the Extinction Rebellion environmental activists\u0027 camp at Marble Arch to remove sound equipment after having killed the main power supply to the campBrexit latest news: Theresa May warned against holding crunch vote on Brexit laws as Labour says it still opposes PM\u0026#39s dealDonald Trump accuses UK of spying on his 2016 campaign, reigniting row with GCHQLyra McKee: Priest calls for \u0026#39new beginning\u0026#39 in Northern Ireland as Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn join mournersHuman rights judges could force British embassies to handle asylum requests, warns Geoffrey CoxSri Lanka suicide bomber who studied in UK is named as Abdul Lathief Jameel MohamedNicola Sturgeon backs off over indy ref 2 demand now but hints Jeremy Corbyn would allow itInside a royal rift: what\u0026#39s really going on with William and Harry?James Holzhauer versus Jeopardy!: how a professional gambler beat America’s biggest game showSri Lanka attack victims: IT director from Manchester killed in hotel bomb blastLimit screen time to an hour a day for under 5s with none at all for under 2s, WHO says  Comment: Trump\u0026#39s visit to the UK should be a wake-up call for Britain\u0026#39s declinist, complacent eliteMichel Barnier fears Nigel Farage and his aim to destroy the EU as Brexit Party surges in pollsTfL forced to remove strawberries and cream from Wimbledon advert after it fails to follow its own junk food rulesExmoor hotel being investigated after holding group sex and swingers partiesSri Lanka suicide bomber \u0026#39studied in the UK\u0026#39, defence minister announces as death toll rises to 359Could it be Zara, Eugenie, or the Clooneys - who\u0026#39s in the running to be Baby Sussex\u0026#39s godparents?Comment: There\u0026#39s no way we can trust the tech arm of the Chinese state to run our communicationsRoyal baby name: print off the \u0026#39s sweepstake and playWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/10/09/banknotes-10-0.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6969916  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Bahamas\u0027 20 dollar note  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/10/09/banknotes-10-0.jpg","title":"bank england governor mark carney replacement philip hammond","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Among the leading candidates are Financial Conduct Authority chief Andrew Bailey, and BoE chief economist\u0026nbspAndy Haldane and deputy governor Ben Broadbent.Mr Hammond said: “Finding a candidate with the right skills and experience to lead the Bank of England is vital for ensuring the continuing strength of our economy and for maintaining the UK’s position as a leading global financial centre.”The chancellor also paid tribute to Mr Carney’s leadership.He said: “His steady hand has helped steer the UK economy through a challenging period and we are now seeing stable, low inflation and the fastest wage growth in over a decade.“And under Mark’s leadership the Bank of England has been at the forefront of reforms to make our financial system safer and more accountable.”Candidates must be able to commit to an eight-year term, rather then the five years that Mr Carney had agreed.The governor chairs the Bank of England’s three central committees: the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates the Financial Policy Committee, which monitors risks in the financial system and the Prudential Regulation Authority, which regulates the biggest financial firms.Critics have said the governor’s role has become too politicised in recent times, notably since the EU referendum in June 2016. Threadneedle Street has come under fire, particularly from Leave supporters, for its gloomy economic forecast in the wake of the Brexit vote.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe short-term moving average for the price of bitcoin has finally moved above the longer-term average, which is often referred to as a golden cross, so investors are starting to believe that we might just be approaching a new phase for the price of bitcoin.After passing $5,000 earlier this month, market analysts see $6,000 as the next crucial price point that will test the direction of the market.\u0026nbspNorth Korea \u0027using cryptocurrency to fund nuclear weapons development\u0027If it does manage to continue past that price, Mr Peters predicts the value of bitcoin will carry on rising throughout 2019 to take it to around 60 to 70 per cent of its all-time high.This forecast would take bitcoin to around $14,000 – more than double its current price.Other experts, however, believe bitcoin will experience more short-term losses before any major rise in value.As bitcoin edges back up, that previous $6,000 support leve has now turned into resistance and is now firmly in the spotlight, George McDonaugh, CEO of digital asset investment firm KR1, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.A more back above here will bring the $10,000 level back in focus. I think breaking through it on its first attempt any time this month in unlikely. What is most likely to happen is that it will test $6,000, fail and head back down towards $4,000.I would expect the price to break through $6,000 on any second or third attempt and from there the aim would be to get back to $10,000.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He sounds like a medieval general. He makes vans.\u0026nbspHis name is Xu Qiuhua. He is another of those “big” personalities you always find in the car business –\u0026nbspHenry Ford, Ferdinand Porsche, William Morris, Lee Iacocca, Soichiro Honda, Sergio Marchionne, Dieter Zetsche, Carlos Ghosn… Xu Qiuhua, who runs the Maxus ision of the Shanghai-based SAIC Motor, will go far.Such combative views on the Darwinian realties of survival in the car industry, even in private, are rare. Perhaps if such an uncompromising and single-minded approach had been taken by the chaps who\u0026nbspused to run our own “native” car businesses,\u0026nbspbrands such as Austin, Morris, Hillman and Triumph would still be pouring out of British car factories. \u0026nbspIt is rather like visiting a parallel universe, travelling as I did to see\u0026nbspthe Chinese car industry and the showcase Shanghai Motor Show – at which only a portion of the country’s 72 car makers are represented. It is an answer to the question: “What might have happened to what was left of the ‘indigenous’ British motor industry if it had had a huge dose of investment and the latest technology injected into it?”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The short answer is SAIC\u0026nbsp(Shanghai\u0026nbspAutomotive Industry\u0026nbspCorporation), which, by a variety of chance circumstances has ended up with MG\u0026nbspRover – rebranded and repronounced after legal issues as Roewe and LDV, which used to make the Maxus van.\u0026nbspA half-century ago these famous names or operations were all part of the British Leyland Motor Corporation, at that time one of the biggest motor corporations in the world (fifth, in fact, by revenues, making over a million vehicles per annum\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsphuge by the standards of the time).By the 2000s after a terrible saga of decline, it has been dismembered. Now Jaguar Land Rover is (mostly) successful as part of the Indian-based Tata Group, and BMW, after a brief stewardship of the old group, has revitalised Mini (albeit both UK businesses face those notorious Brexit uncertainties). They’re still mostly in Britain.\u0026nbspExcepting a small engineering and design presence in Birmingham and London, however, the other surviving brands are in China under the ownership of SAIC, the parent company of SAIC\u0026nbspMotor UK Technical Centre (SMTC UK), which looks after the “British” brands.They are doing well too, which just adds to the sense of schadenfreude. After all, Sweden, Germany, France and Italy all managed to somehow hang on to national champions with extensive activities in high-cost western Europe – why not the UK?What might have been…and also what might have been under the owners of MG Rover in the first decade of this country, who had a (slim) chance of securing a partnership with a Chinese group such as SAIC or Brilliance China Automotive, but instead found themselves pursuing some distractions of their own.SAIC\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphyperactive, launching a starry array of new models, many now independently developed by the Chinese group. Like the Japanese and Koreans before them, such local assembly operations facilitated transfer of technology and know-how into the local industry – Nissan once built Austin Cambridges, and Hyundai manufactured a version of the Ford Cortina.\u0026nbspSAIC too started out learning how to make vehicles decades ago through joint ventures with VW and General Motors, making obsolescent Santanas and Buicks. They also transported the assembly lines for the old Rover 75 and the LDV Maxus van from Birmingham over to China a few years ago.Now SAIC makes 7\u0026nbspmillion cars a year, and with total revenues of $133.6bn (£103bn), yielding\u0026nbspprofits of $5.3bn (£4bn). By comparison, the entire UK car industry makes about 1.5 million cars, and the Chinese, even going through a bit of a downturn, buy as many new cars in one month as the British do in a year.Jaguar owner posts thumping loss in another blow to UK car industrySet SAIC against Toyota, say. Toyota makes around\u0026nbsp9\u0026nbspmillion cars a year, but has proportionately larger margins on its upmarket and more sophisticated products selling in developed, mature markets. Hence Toyota’s superior profitability – $23bn\u0026nbsp(£17.8).SAIC, and the Chinese industry’s best hope of global dominance, is to leapfrog the German and Japanese-based firms to win the race for leadership in electric cars and autonomous driving, both areas where China has an early lead. It has the biggest lithium ion battery production in the world and has secured many of the minerals needed for the new technologies, such as cobalt and rare earth minerals. And we all know about Huawei’s controversial 5G expertise.So China’s increasing technological strength means its cars have moved on from being cheapish facelifts of ageing designs such as the Rover 75 and LDV Maxus van, a vehicle that goes back to a joint venture with Daewoo nearly two decades ago.\u0026nbspThat van is actually still in production at SAIC, as the Maxus V80, the assembly line having migrated from Poland to Birmingham and thence to Nanjing. There’s a nifty little camper van they’re promoting on this familiar shape. Some have been exported “back” to the UK.\u0026nbspYet lately it has been used by SAIC to test hydrogen fuel cells and driverless technology (which makes most sense for local van deliveries).Now the old LDV design has been superseded by a smart all-new “V90”, which, like the Mercedes V-Class even offers buyers front- or rear-wheel drive, as well as petrol, diesel or electric propulsion, and a variety of body styles.As unveiled at the Shanghai show, it appears class competitive with the likes of the Ford Transit – though only active use will determine whether it is durable. There are also question marks, as there have long been, about the safety of Chinese-engineered vehicles, a factor in their slow acceptance in\u0026nbspricher markets.Even so, the developments are continuing apace. SAIC is making the most of its portfolio of badges. Maxus, for example, has become a marque in its own right – with a new big people carrier, the D50, a rather slabby affair in the tradition of the Renault Espace, Kia Sedona and Toyota Picnic. This one-box family motor may have gone out of style in the west, but in China the relaxation of the so-called “one child” policy, plus an ageing population, may produce a stronger demand for such a vehicleWith MG, too, the Chinese firm is pushing its British roots ever more powerfully, using the Queen, the Beatles and Benedict Cumberbatch in its promotional efforts. The twist is an implication that this venerable but knackered British brand had to be rescued by Chinese technology.There is something in that, I’ll admit.Nowadays MG stands for “my glamour”, and is the sporty, funky end of the range. They’ve even revived the old “X-Power” and “Trophy”\u0026nbsp performance\u0026nbsp sub-brands from the Longbridge era. The latest slogan is: “Make MG Great Again.”\u0026nbspTheir new HS larger SUV and electric MG EZS make a case for that.\u0026nbspSAIC is, then, a typical Chinese motor company – massive but you might have never heard of it. It makes a huge range of vehicles, from a gigantic and well-appointed luxury SUV made with Roewe (the descendant of Rover) and MG badging through to utilitarian vans, lorries and, who knows, smaller electric and autonomous city cars in the future.The Chinese are also busily developing hydrogen fuel cell technology – another zero-emissions method of propulsion, though arguably less energy efficient than pure battery power from mains electricity. They have a plant abroad, in\u0026nbspThailand, plus the usual test tracks, research and wind tunnel facilities. They can do most things on their own, with only transmissions being a major buy-in.The only thing that is really holding the Chinese industry back is to achieve modern advanced standards of build quality and durability, and to catch up with the western makes in terms of secondary safety – protecting passengers in a smash. SAIC’s rival\u0026nbspGeely, a private sector Chinese firm, has\u0026nbspacquired Volvo, famed for its attention to safety, which should help.Dongfeng\u0026nbspMotor Group has taken around a 14 per cent stake in Groupe PSA (formerly PSA Peugeot Citroen), and SAIC Motor has about a 1 per cent holding in General Motors.Daimler, parent of Mercedes-Benz, already owns a 10 per cent stake in BAIC, the Beijing Automotive group, and BAIC holds 10 per cent of Daimler. They have a joint venture to produce Mercedes-Benz cars in China, and the mutual advantages to build scale and ersity, reduce risks and costs and exchange technology is apparent.\u0026nbspSo the links – financial, corporate and technological – between China’s rapidly advancing auto companies and the west’s more established brands are gradually growing tighter and more intricate. It is, for now, a more balanced relationship between east and west. Underneath, it is still a Darwinian struggle, though.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were told in no uncertain terms to get to work or lose a month’s pay. They had no choice but to get to work.Just one hour later, the eight-storey Rana Plaza collapsed on itself, its weak structures no longer able to carry the generators illegally placed on its roof to avoid the frequent power cuts disrupting workflow. They brought down the entire rickety building floor by floor taking thousands of workers with them. The final death toll was 1,134\u0026nbspwith a further 2,500 injured.Modern slavery is not just a developing world problem. It is a problem largely driven and largely sustained by us in the west. And modern slavery is not just a problem created by multinationals that are seeking to maximise their profits, whatever the cost. They do it because we, as customers, want them to keep up with our insatiable appetites. In the retail world, “fast fashion” means demand for more and more clothes that get discarded quicker than ever which in turn means that factory owners have to find ever newer ways of keeping up.Increasingly in the west it’s businesses that are being held to scrutiny for having driven practices we have in the past simply turned a blind eye to. This is coming through employee activism – people not wanting to work for a company perpetuates these barbaric standards – but also from the rise of the ethical millennial consumer. We’ve yet to see much evidence of shareholder revolts over the matter but businesses tend to respond when competitors gain competitive advantage.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Modern Slavery in the UK Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.NCA has launched a touring photographic exhibition which aims to portray the signs of slavery and exploitation.

There are approximately 13,000 known cases of people living under modern slavery conditions here in the UK that we are aware of which of course means the real number will be significantly higher.\u0026nbspThe main routes are from Nigeria (domestic and sex workers), Vietnam (nail shops) and Albania (car washing). I recently became high sheriff of Greater London and this will be a core focus of my year in office as the majority of human trafficking and modern slavery practices are conducted in the capital.Organisations like the Human Trafficking Foundation are working with the politan Police and local authorities to help them detect where it is taking place, often in homes and businesses in our neighbourhoods.\u0026nbspThe Modern Slavery Act was introduced in 2015, making it easier to prosecute traffickers and to not prosecute victims of slavery for crimes they were forced to commit. It also commits big businesses to report how they are tackling the problem in their supply chain. The legislation is currently under review and Baroness Lola Young is among the many parliamentarians seeking to give it more teeth.So far little has been done to engage SMEs\u0026nbsp(small and medium-sized enterprises) in this conversation and that needs to change. It’s of course easier said than done but the process of engagement has to start as businesses often need persistent nagging to behave better. A decade ago, I attended a Business in the Community conference on climate change and the role we all had to play. We were all asked to sign a pledge by the Prince of Wales and so we did and then later read what the pledge obliged us to do, the main component of which was to ask ten companies in our supply chain what they would do to reduce their carbon emissions.\u0026nbspI wrote to 10 of our suppliers and not one of them replied.\u0026nbspBut today, in a world where Greta Thunberg walks into parliament and takes down MPs for failing to act earlier on the environment and where retailers risk losing customers if they have no plan for eliminating single use plastic, we see that it takes a movement of noises over time to drive change.\u0026nbspPublic-facing SMEs often see human trafficking and modern slavery as phenomena that affect other businesses and not theirs. It will require more than employee activism to trigger action on this front. It will need consumer activism and the threat of shopping elsewhere.In the meantime, the next time you’re having your nails done or your car washed, look around you. Watch for bruises and exhaustion in employees, look out for sleeping bags in the corner and if you see anything suspicious around you, there are numbers to call like The Salvation Army’s response unit.Businesses of all sizes are likely to be complicit in such evil. We need to be better held to account if we’re not confronting it.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Among the leading candidates are Financial Conduct Authority chief Andrew Bailey, and BoE chief economist\u0026nbspAndy Haldane and deputy governor Ben Broadbent.Mr Hammond said: “Finding a candidate with the right skills and experience to lead the Bank of England is vital for ensuring the continuing strength of our economy and for maintaining the UK’s position as a leading global financial centre.”The chancellor also paid tribute to Mr Carney’s leadership.He said: “His steady hand has helped steer the UK economy through a challenging period and we are now seeing stable, low inflation and the fastest wage growth in over a decade.“And under Mark’s leadership the Bank of England has been at the forefront of reforms to make our financial system safer and more accountable.”Candidates must be able to commit to an eight-year term, rather then the five years that Mr Carney had agreed.The governor chairs the Bank of England’s three central committees: the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates the Financial Policy Committee, which monitors risks in the financial system and the Prudential Regulation Authority, which regulates the biggest financial firms.Critics have said the governor’s role has become too politicised in recent times, notably since the EU referendum in June 2016. Threadneedle Street has come under fire, particularly from Leave supporters, for its gloomy economic forecast in the wake of the Brexit vote.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our data lets us look beneath the headline figures at what is happening to young people from different backgrounds, in different parts of the country, and with different qualifications, and, for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, this is not a good news story.“We are breaking a fundamental promise to young people in this country. We tell them: \u0027Study hard, get your qualifications and good jobs will follow\u0027.“For many young people this is true, but for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds it isn\u0027t. They are less likely to get those qualifications, and even when they do, less likely to benefit.”Stefan Speckesser, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which helped with the study, said: “By showing regional and local differences in the employment gap, we find evidence that some local areas are more successfully tackling the negative effects of disadvantage, which are unrelated to education success, on young people\u0027s school-to-work transitions.”The findings, involving 18 to 24-year-old Neets in England, are drawn from Education Department data.Shadow employment minister Mike Amesbury said: “This report must act as a wake-up call to the Government. Young people who have grown up in poverty can face significant disadvantages when they come to look for their first job.“The Tory Party is failing young people, who are too often trapped in low-paid and insecure work, but the Government is refusing to track whether or not its flagship youth employment programme, the Youth Obligation, is working.”Mark Hawthorne, of the Local Government Association, said: “The Government needs to consider LGA proposals for an integrated employment and skills service led by local authorities.“Devolving careers advice, post-16 and adult skills budgets and powers to local areas would allow councils, schools, colleges and employers to work together to improve provision for young people so that they can get on in life.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Politicians and bureaucrats don’t have the answer. The man down the pub doesn’t have the answer. So maybe it’s time we look to literature, writes Erica WickersonClick to followThe IndependentLove Means Love: Cordelia visits her ailing father King Lear, who feels ashamed of falling for the £350m-a-week promises made by his elder daughtersThe chaos of politics, the searing isions through society, the promised demise of faith in democracy: it might look like the country is in an unprecedented state of strife and upheaval over Brexit. But writers have been talking about this stuff for centuries.King Lear’s shuffle into dementia as he tears apart his kingdom on a vain whim. Dickens’s revolutionary bloodshed in A Tale of Two Cities conjuring tensions within and across borders. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman challenging the imperialist march of the Nazis in Casablanca. How does culture sort out the bloody mess of social, political\u0026nbspand geographical isions? Politicians and bureaucrats don’t have the answer. The man down the pub doesn’t have the answer. So maybe it’s time we look to literature.Ali Smith’s Autumn – the first in her seasonal quartet (the third in the cycle, Spring, has just come out) – is perhaps the first “Brexit novel” (what a terrifying label!), written in the immediate wake of the 2016 referendum. Its opening lines wave to Dickens: “It was the worst of times, it was the worst of times.” Too right, Ali. “That’s the thing about things. They fall apart, always have, always will.” Here a nod to Yeats’s A Second Coming. Yeats, Smith, Dickens, Shakespeare: they’re all rife with images of separation, objects torn asunder. Yeats writes:Things fall apart the centre cannot holdAll too apt for today. In last year’s National Theatre production, Ian McKellen’s King Lear actually tears up the map of his kingdom in a haphazard, manically whimsical way. Dickens’s evocation of “Madame La Guillotine”, sensuously and seductively worshipped by the revolutionaries in A Tale of Two Cities, replacing crucifixes and covering the streets with blood, is an object that literally and metaphorically separates. And this is a thread taken up by Smith in the literary descriptions of collage art scattered across Autumn: beautiful and haphazard like fallen leaves, but also artistically juxtaposing separation and difference.Created with Sketch.The 25 best books by women Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Pride and Prejudice – Jane AustenAusten remains one of history’s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire. Pride and Prejudice, then, sees her at the peak of her powers. Through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet, her sharp-witted protagonist, we witness upper-class Regency England as both a dream and a farce. Not all is as it seems, and society betrays its holloweness when it deems that money should trump love. Despite the fact that Hurston was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, Their Eyes Were Watching God was largely rejected by her peers. It was during the 1970s and 1980s that her novel was essentially rediscovered, with many contemporary black feminists heralding the genius of her work. The novel focuses on Janie Crawford, a black woman who refuses to give in to bitterness or sorrow, as she navigates three marriages and a life marked by poverty. It’s a story bursting with passion and soulfulness. 325 The Lottery and Other Stories – Shirley Jackson Jackson probed the darkest corners of the American psyche during the 1940s and 1950s, all thanks to her collections of ghost stories, including 1959’s The Haunting of Hill House, which was recently adapted into a Netflix series. With several novels and over 200 short stories for readers to get lost in, there are very few horror writers like her. That’s especially true when it comes to (arguably) her greatest work, 1948’s The Lottery, which traces a small town’s annual tradition to its sinister conclusion. A Pulitzer Prize winner, To Kill a Mockingbird has carved its place in history. Its depiction of racial injustice in the American Deep South was startling frank for the 1960s, in a way that undeniably had a social impact at the time – it became an instant sensation and is now widely taught in American schools. Lee writes about the world’s cruelties with an honesty and compassion that still resonates, with the character of Atticus Finch becoming a enduring model of integrity for the legal profession. Butler was a key figure in sci-fi history, expanding the boundaries of what the genre could achieve and what it could come to represent. First published in 1979, the book still feels as fresh as ever in its first-person account of a young black writer, Dana, who through strange circumstances, finds herself travelling between her own reality and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. It’s through this unusual theme that Butler can explore the lasting trauma of America’s history on African-Americans today. Jane Eyre feels, in many ways, thoroughly modern today. Although originally published under the pen name “Currer Bell”, it feels likes a e into the mind of Brontë herself. The story is told through a first-person narrative that feels so psychologically intimate, it’s as if she’s sharing the secrets of her own world with us. We follow Jane through her school years, all the way to her later employment by Mr Rochester, a tortured soul who she falls madly in love with, with many aspects of her journey reflecting elements of Brontë’s own life. 725 Half of a Yellow Sun – Chimamanda Ngozi AdichieAdichie, who was born in Nigeria, is considered one of the most original literary voices of her generation. You can see why this is when reading Half of a Yellow Sun, which depicts the brutality of the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s, as seen through four different perspectives: twin daughters of a wealthy businessman, a British citizen, a professor, and a houseboy. It’s history via an achingly human lens. Smith remains a modern titan of the British literary scene, thanks partially to White Teeth, which is considered one of the most sensational fiction debuts of all time, becoming an immediate bestseller and sweeping up multiple awards. It’s a tale of two men – Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones – who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 925 The Hour of the Star - Clarice LispectorLispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macabéa, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector’s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil. However, the way Rodrigo perceives Macabéa, and reckons with her story, itself creates a dialogue between the two characters, calling into question notions of identity and authorship. One of literature’s sharpest minds and inspiration to the feminist movement in the 1970s, Woolf not only helped pioneer the use of the stream of consciousness as a narrative device, but utilised it to speak openly about sexuality, mental illness, and gender roles. The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 1125 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories – Flannery O’Connor O’Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story’s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi’s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It’s the political seen through the personal, but it’s always Satrapi’s own spirit that shines the brightest. Many have now come to consider Shelley’s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character’s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley’s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It’s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man’s unbridled power. Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter. It’s through this vivid sense of magical realism that Morrison can confront the unfathomable trauma that slavery has inflicted on the African-American collective memory.Although the book has received increased attention thanks to Hulu’s critically acclaimed TV adaptation, it’s all thanks to the fierceness of Atwood’s critical analysis of gender politics. Her 1985 book, which imagines a near-future New England controlled by a totalitarian state, in which women are completely subjugated to men, has only become increasingly relevant – and prescient. Her work provides a continued reminder that it doesn’t take much for our world to slip into complete dystopia. Mary Anne Evans, amongst other concerns, feared that her work, Middlemarch, would be dismissed entirely due to the notion that women’s writing was strictly light and romantic. And so, instead, it was published in eight instalments across 1871 and 1872 under the name George Eliot. The book is far from light set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, it follows a vast, sweeping narrative that encompasses subjects of religion, idealism, and political reform. Ng writes about American suburbia with an astounding clarity, perhaps partially because she considers the act of writing about one’s hometown as a little like “writing about a relative”, with an attachment that perceives both their greatest attributes and their flaws. Little Fires Everywhere is her second novel to take place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she grew up, and focuses on a new arrival to the town, who sense of mystery disrupts its residents’s obsession with structure and rules. Famous for its popularity with teenage girls, Plath’s work speaks to clearly to an adolescent precisely because it makes no attempt to sugar-coat the prospect of the entrance into adulthood. The book’s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women’s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther’s frustration that has been a comfort to many. My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante’s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it’s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 2025 The Age of Innocence – Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York’s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds – in every other way society’s perfect vision of man and woman – find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society’s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker’s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist’s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It’s no wonder that the book’s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn’t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period. In its story of a woman whose whirlwind courtship with a widower turns sour when she becomes haunted by the lingering presence of her husband’s first wife, Rebecca is a book filled with suppressed desires, loss, and a looming sense of threat. 2325 The God of Small Things - Arundhati RoyAs Roy’s debut novel, it’s an extraordinary first outing. Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book’s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins’s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 2425 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha ChristieWe may know every twist and turn of Christie’s best works by now, but there’s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers. Murder on the Orient Express still feels like her most enthralling work, as famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself in the midst of a murder scene, after his train is blocked by the heavy snowfall and a passenger is found dead, making the rest of those on board all instant suspects. 2525 The Tale of Genji – Murasaki ShikibuThe oldest book on this list, this classic of Japanese literature was written by Shikibu, a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, in the early 11th century. Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what’s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it’s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan.125 Pride and Prejudice – Jane AustenAusten remains one of history’s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire. Pride and Prejudice, then, sees her at the peak of her powers. Through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet, her sharp-witted protagonist, we witness upper-class Regency England as both a dream and a farce.

It’s a story bursting with passion and soulfulness. 325 The Lottery and Other Stories – Shirley Jackson Jackson probed the darkest corners of the American psyche during the 1940s and 1950s, all thanks to her collections of ghost stories, including 1959’s The Haunting of Hill House, which was recently adapted into a Netflix series. With several novels and over 200 short stories for readers to get lost in, there are very few horror writers like her. That’s especially true when it comes to (arguably) her greatest work, 1948’s The Lottery, which traces a small town’s annual tradition to its sinister conclusion. A Pulitzer Prize winner, To Kill a Mockingbird has carved its place in history. Its depiction of racial injustice in the American Deep South was startling frank for the 1960s, in a way that undeniably had a social impact at the time – it became an instant sensation and is now widely taught in American schools. Lee writes about the world’s cruelties with an honesty and compassion that still resonates, with the character of Atticus Finch becoming a enduring model of integrity for the legal profession. Butler was a key figure in sci-fi history, expanding the boundaries of what the genre could achieve and what it could come to represent. First published in 1979, the book still feels as fresh as ever in its first-person account of a young black writer, Dana, who through strange circumstances, finds herself travelling between her own reality and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. It’s through this unusual theme that Butler can explore the lasting trauma of America’s history on African-Americans today. Jane Eyre feels, in many ways, thoroughly modern today. Although originally published under the pen name “Currer Bell”, it feels likes a e into the mind of Brontë herself. The story is told through a first-person narrative that feels so psychologically intimate, it’s as if she’s sharing the secrets of her own world with us. We follow Jane through her school years, all the way to her later employment by Mr Rochester, a tortured soul who she falls madly in love with, with many aspects of her journey reflecting elements of Brontë’s own life. 725 Half of a Yellow Sun – Chimamanda Ngozi AdichieAdichie, who was born in Nigeria, is considered one of the most original literary voices of her generation. You can see why this is when reading Half of a Yellow Sun, which depicts the brutality of the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s, as seen through four different perspectives: twin daughters of a wealthy businessman, a British citizen, a professor, and a houseboy. It’s history via an achingly human lens. Smith remains a modern titan of the British literary scene, thanks partially to White Teeth, which is considered one of the most sensational fiction debuts of all time, becoming an immediate bestseller and sweeping up multiple awards. It’s a tale of two men – Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones – who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 925 The Hour of the Star - Clarice LispectorLispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macabéa, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector’s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil. However, the way Rodrigo perceives Macabéa, and reckons with her story, itself creates a dialogue between the two characters, calling into question notions of identity and authorship. One of literature’s sharpest minds and inspiration to the feminist movement in the 1970s, Woolf not only helped pioneer the use of the stream of consciousness as a narrative device, but utilised it to speak openly about sexuality, mental illness, and gender roles. The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 1125 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories – Flannery O’Connor O’Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story’s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi’s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It’s the political seen through the personal, but it’s always Satrapi’s own spirit that shines the brightest. Many have now come to consider Shelley’s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character’s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley’s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It’s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man’s unbridled power. Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter. It’s through this vivid sense of magical realism that Morrison can confront the unfathomable trauma that slavery has inflicted on the African-American collective memory.Although the book has received increased attention thanks to Hulu’s critically acclaimed TV adaptation, it’s all thanks to the fierceness of Atwood’s critical analysis of gender politics. Her 1985 book, which imagines a near-future New England controlled by a totalitarian state, in which women are completely subjugated to men, has only become increasingly relevant – and prescient. Her work provides a continued reminder that it doesn’t take much for our world to slip into complete dystopia. Mary Anne Evans, amongst other concerns, feared that her work, Middlemarch, would be dismissed entirely due to the notion that women’s writing was strictly light and romantic. And so, instead, it was published in eight instalments across 1871 and 1872 under the name George Eliot. The book is far from light set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, it follows a vast, sweeping narrative that encompasses subjects of religion, idealism, and political reform. Ng writes about American suburbia with an astounding clarity, perhaps partially because she considers the act of writing about one’s hometown as a little like “writing about a relative”, with an attachment that perceives both their greatest attributes and their flaws. Little Fires Everywhere is her second novel to take place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she grew up, and focuses on a new arrival to the town, who sense of mystery disrupts its residents’s obsession with structure and rules. Famous for its popularity with teenage girls, Plath’s work speaks to clearly to an adolescent precisely because it makes no attempt to sugar-coat the prospect of the entrance into adulthood. The book’s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women’s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther’s frustration that has been a comfort to many. My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante’s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it’s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 2025 The Age of Innocence – Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York’s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds – in every other way society’s perfect vision of man and woman – find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society’s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker’s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist’s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It’s no wonder that the book’s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn’t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period. In its story of a woman whose whirlwind courtship with a widower turns sour when she becomes haunted by the lingering presence of her husband’s first wife, Rebecca is a book filled with suppressed desires, loss, and a looming sense of threat. 2325 The God of Small Things - Arundhati RoyAs Roy’s debut novel, it’s an extraordinary first outing. Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book’s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins’s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 2425 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha ChristieWe may know every twist and turn of Christie’s best works by now, but there’s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers. Murder on the Orient Express still feels like her most enthralling work, as famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself in the midst of a murder scene, after his train is blocked by the heavy snowfall and a passenger is found dead, making the rest of those on board all instant suspects. 2525 The Tale of Genji – Murasaki ShikibuThe oldest book on this list, this classic of Japanese literature was written by Shikibu, a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, in the early 11th century. Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what’s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it’s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan.These works show the chopping up of society along multiple axes. Politics. Class. Nationality. Age. A Brexit checklist.There is a widely held perception that it was the baby boomers who swung the 2016 referendum in favour of Leave, the older generation who have a lot less to lose. This generational ide reverberates through cultural depictions of ided nations too.Brexit: The Uncivil War review – an engrossing second draft of historyShakespeare’s King Lear is a play about madness and politics, shown through the failings of a father. Lear decides to bequeath his three daughters different portions of his kingdom according to how much they love him or rather, how convincingly they can express their love for him. Literature is all about conflict. So perhaps it’s unsurprising that not all of Lear’s daughters go along with this display of pride and vanity.The first two, Goneril and Regan, egged on by their greedy husbands, eagerly flatter their father. But when it comes to the third, Cordelia – the youngest and the favourite – the voice of reason prevails. She tells her father that she loves him just as much as a dutiful daughter should but that there’s no need to flatter his delusion of a good Brexit deal. Ahem. The need for a healthy sized dowry with which she can attract a good husband.King Lear is so convinced of his worth and his children’s performance of love for him, that he makes the biggest booboo possible just as he’s on the decline: he chops up his kingdom and pisses off his loved ones. The UK is so convinced of Europe’s desperation to be friends, we’ve made the booboo of expecting an Ali Baba Cave of Wonders with the Brexit deal. And it’s about as realistic an expectation as Ali Baba’s treasure.A Tale of Two Cities\u0026nbspis in part about control: who is in charge? Who sets the law? But it isn’t just a battle within France, it’s also across bordersA Tale of Two Cities is also, in effect, about politics and madness, and how the shadows of the older generation linger over the young. It’s set during the reign of terror, late\u0026nbsp18th century Paris and London, the French Revolution. And this period is conjured through the twisted fate of a father, daughter, and two men who bear a striking physical resemblance to one another but are diametrically opposed in character. Like Shakespeare, Dickens also shows the father being cause of his beloved daughter’s despair, but, in his case, it is unwitting. It is the father’s accidental testimony that ultimately leads to the death sentence for his son-in-law, Charles Darnay.Ali Smith’s Autumn is a quiet elegy to a Europe in demise, and the condemned, precarious young who have to watch it falter. It effectively picks up the ShakespeareanDickensian tale from the perspective of the daughter. The protagonist, Elisabeth Demand: 32 years old, no-fixed-hours casual contract junior lecturer at a university in London, living the dream, her mother says, and she is, if the dream means having no job security and almost everything being too expensive to do and that you’re still in the same rented flat you had when you were a student over a decade ago.Stryver at Tellson’s Bank, from a scene in ‘A Tale of Two Cities’\u0026nbsp(Getty)In many ways, she epitomises a generation, or at least part of it.\u0026nbspElisabeth loves and desperately clings to her dying friend, the 101-year-old former émigré, Daniel Gluck – the personification of a disappearing Europe, a cultured, sensitive, intelligent man, full of possibility and mystery. By contrast, Elisabeth has a strained relationship with her mother – a woman more interested in going to the pub than getting to know her neighbours.These stories show the fuck-ups of the older generation condemning the young to a life of lost possibility – the lost possibility to travel, to live, to love as we want.But it was also overwhelmingly the case that non-graduates were far more likely to vote to leave the EU than those with degrees. And this brings up the question of class and privilege.At the heart of A Tale of Two Cities is a raging class war, a class war of caricatured evil. The Marquis St\u0026nbspEvrémonde, the aristocrat who needs no fewer than four servants to prepare his morning hot chocolate while people starve in the streets, speeds through Paris in his voluptuous carriage and hits a small child, killing him instantly. He insults the crowd, calls them dogs, curses them for delaying him and not taking better care of their children. Then he goes on his way, barely ruffled. In this climate, the bloodthirsty rising of the proletariat seems to have a pretty strong justification.A Tale of Two Cities is in part about control: who is in charge? Who sets the law? But it isn’t just a battle within France, it’s also across borders. One of the factors that damns the hero, Charles Darnay, is his decision to live in exile in England. He explains this as an economic immigration: in France, he has no means to live.A Tale of Two Cities and its modernised re-telling in Casablanca both resolve the turgid concoction of political and romantic tensions (semi-spoiler alert) through acts of self-sacrifice. One person trades places with another. We see this kind of doubling in King Lear too with the half-brothers Edmund and Edgar, alike in name but polar opposites in character. And, much like Harry Potter and Voldemort (a DickensianShakespearean echo?), it seems that in each of these pairs, one must die so that the other may live.King Lear\u0026nbspshows all too tragically how the public performance of affection is prized over the genuine and sincere feeling of love (and what is the Brexit game if not a monstrous public performance of who has what to offer?)This isn’t really a satisfactory solution to today’s problems. There isn’t the possibility of some kind of self-sacrifice that will ensure continued life in another sense. Maybe a soft Brexit looks like that: a Brexit in name but with all the benefits of the customs union and free movement. But it now seems inevitable that the country is going to be fundamentally ided no matter what the political developments may yield.But it’s worth remembering that all of these works are also basically love stories – though not necessarily about conventional, romantic love.King Lear shows all too tragically how the public performance of affection is prized over the genuine and sincere feeling of love (and what is the Brexit game if not a monstrous public performance of who has what to offer?).\u0026nbspA Tale of Two Cities shows an impossible love triangle between upstanding French émigrés and disaffected, drunken Brits that cannot end happily. There aren’t enough visas for all the protagonists to escape France, so who will make it out?Casablanca is a classic romance that transcends geographical borders. As Ilse (Ingrid Bergman) looks into Rick’s (Humphrey Bogart’s) eyes and tells him she can never leave him again, but she does need the two blank visas that will enable escape from Casablanca and the Nazis, the tears feel real, the kiss feels passionate, the violins soar. Later, Rick sees this moment in a different light. He suggests it was a way of manipulating him into aiding the escape.Bros)And so, we go back to King Lear. His elder daughters make eloquent expressions of their love for him, but it’s clear to everyone other than Lear himself that these are opportunistic overtures with one thing in mind: hope for geographical reign and economic power.The problem for the UK is that the EU isn’t as senile and blinded by vanity as Lear, nor as romantically sentimental as Bogart’s Rick or Dickens’s Sydney Carton. Expressions of love won’t get us through passport control any faster in the post-Brexit world.So what does Ali Smith’s Autumn suggest? Unlike Edgar and Edmund in King Lear, Charles and Sydney in A Tale of Two Cities, Rick and Laszlo in Casablanca, there is no straightforward doubling in Smith’s Autumn. But perhaps that’s part of the point. Elisabeth and Daniel are opposites in many respects. And yet they are drawn together in a touching, benevolent, platonic bond.The 25 best books written by womenThere’s a problem with the way we idolise drunk male writersThe most powerful lines of poetry ever writtenConservatives and Labour reveal plans for key Brexit votes- liveCummings found in contempt of parliament over ‘fake news’ inquiryIn Autumn, the man in the post office, a frustratingly unhelpful clerk positively filibustering Elisabeth’s attempts to do the “Check \u0026amp Send” service to renew her passport (all a huge great metonym for anxieties about identity, nationality, freedom to travel, etc), sees Elisabeth as many of this generation are seen: demanding like her name.“Is your surname really Demand? he says.Uh huh, Elisabeth says. I mean yes.A name you live up to, he says.”The contrasting way of seeing things is a point worth pondering in the light of Brexit and the fog of politics. In Casablanca, Laszlo and Rick are both in love with Ilse. But they see her in very different ways. When she tries to explain herself, her past, her motives to each of them in turn, she is confronted with totally contrasting responses. Laszlo: “You don’t even have to say it. I’ll believe.”\u0026nbspCompare with Rick: “I wouldn’t believe you, no matter what you told me. You’d say anything now to get what you want.”Isn’t this really how most of us feel about politicians? They represent these dualisms. And nothing epitomises this quite like the Brexit debate. People choose their side then believe all or nothing, depending on who’s talking. £350m\u0026nbspfor the NHS. Whether or not it was true seemed to depend more on the listener than the facts.In reality, there is no possibility for self-sacrifice or a deus ex machina to sort out the cataclysmic mess of parliament, Brexit\u0026nbspand national ision. The older stories, Shakespeare and Dickens, are tragedies. Someone has to die. Casablanca is more open, though still pretty heart-wrenching. Remember the famous closing line: “I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship”. And maybe Ali Smith picks up where Casablanca leaves off. A beautiful friendship. But the ending is left open. This is where we are now. Watching our relationship with Europe die. But at the end of Autumn, Europe’s personification rallies, he wakes up, asks what Elisabeth is reading, smiles. There is still time.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It proved that claim last year, when it carried Eliud Kipchoge across the finish line at the Berlin Marathon, more quickly than ever before, not just breaking the world record but shaving a minute and 18 seconds off it all in one go.The claims seemed a little too good to be true,\u0026nbspbut have been largely borne out in use. A study of publicly available race data by the New York Times last year showed that the shoe added about 3 to 4 per cent of speed\u0026nbspwhen compared to runners wearing other shoes, and they seemed to have gained more than 1 per cent when compared to the next-fastest shoe.They do that by changing what happens to the energy usually lost when a shoe hits the floor, as its wearer runs. Usually, that gets dispersed as heat,\u0026nbspbut the Nike technology allows it to bounce back into the air, preserving the energy and speeding up the runner.It only makes a small amount of difference. But that small difference adds up over the course of a race, and can decide who wins – meaning that improvements can prove controversial, and lead to questions about just how quick a shoe should even be allowed to be.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple has cancelled its AirPower wireless charging mat, which was slated as a way to charge numerous apple products at once India has claimed status as part of a super league of nations after shooting down a live satellite in a test of new missile technology5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

What it says is the fastest shoe in the world\u0026nbspcould be about\u0026nbspto get\u0026nbspfaster.It takes all the same innovations, the most notable of which is the carbon fibre plate that sits cushioned in foam underneath the foot, taking the energy when it hits the road and recycling it to propel athletes forward faster. That breakthrough is untouched in the new shoe –\u0026nbspthe plate is the same size and material, altered only slightly to fit in the new shoe.(Kipchoge has called this system perfect...really perfect, and Nike\u0026nbsprepeatedly stresses how tough it has been to update this shoe. As such, much has been left the same and every change has been prompted by precise feedback from its elite runners.)Serena Williams urges women to ‘dream crazier’ with Nike advertKeeping much of the shoe the same should avoid some of the controversy that has dogged the previous shoe, with claims that it is helping out its athletes a little too much. Nothing has changed about that central innovation, and it has worked closely with the\u0026nbspInternational Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to ensure that what changes there are still fit within its rules.That extra boost – as well as the other improvements, like a brand new woven material on the upper part of the shoe and a change in the placements of the laces – could be enough to break through the two hour mark, which has become an important if arbitrary goal. These shoes emerged from Nike\u0027s Breaking2 project, created precisely to do that.Eliud Kipchoge got tantalisingly close to that mark when he broke through the marathon record last year: he was just one minute and 39 seconds away. If this shoe gave the same kind of boost its predecessor does, that milestone could finally be broken through.Nike has been working with runners including Kipchoge to make sure that every change in these new shoes responds to feedback from athletes, with the general principle of ensuring they feel comfortable and secure despite the chunky heel and lightweight. The outsole is made of a more durable and grippy material, which came in response to\u0026nbspKipchoge\u0027s concerns about handling when running in wet weather the foam is differently distributed to make it feel even more secure the laces have been moved towards the sides of the shoe rather than the centre, pushing them away from the sensitive part of the foot.With all of those changes, is this the one to finally break through that mark? It could be, says Holts, noting that it does have something to do with the athlete, so requires perfect conditions and elite performance as well as good shoes.But they\u0027ll certainly be trying, from London and then onto other marathons like Berlin, where that record was beaten last year. From this weekend, elite runners\u0026nbsp– including Kipchoge and Mo Farah – will be lining up wearing the new shoes, swapping the now famous red of the predecessor for the green (or phantom glow) of the new shoes.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Something that once was widely advertised, then restricted, and now banned from advertising altogether.Will those damaged, or even killed by gambling be our legacy? Or is this our chance to get the balance right between funding sport, using technology, and having the right protections to prevent tragedy?The Gambling (Industry Levy Review And Protections For Vulnerable People) Bill will call for the money raised to go to help research the effects of gambling addiction, funding gambling addiction clinics, and improving safeguards for children and vulnerable people.Mr Graham said: Even one life destroyed by gambling is too many, and the depressing thing is that we simply do not know how many people have committed suicide from gambling. The only statistics available suggest that last year between 250 and 650 gamblers committed suicide.His bill will return for\u0026nbspsecond reading on May 10 but it is unlikely to progress without government support.Earlier,\u0026nbspSir Alan Duncan described the executions of 37 men as a deeply backward step by the Saudi governmentResponding to an urgent question in the Commons from Sir Vince Cable, he said: We really do genuinely disapprove in the strongest possible terms what has happened, particularly when it was reported that one of them was displayed on a cross, something that anyone here just a few days after Easter would find more repulsive.He said the government is working to establish the full facts and the foreign secretary will be raising this with the Saudi authorities at the earliest opportunity.British embassy representatives in Riyadh made representations last November on specific iniduals, Sir Alan told MPs, adding: One of the grave concerns about these executions is that it would appear to include minors or those who were minors at the time that the charges were made. This, of course, is totally unacceptable and we do deplore it.The UK, he said, had put our name fully to the EU\u0027s European External Action Service\u0027s very, very strong statement of condemnation pointing out that these executions are a regressive step.Sturgeon also compared to Scotland with other countries in Europe, and said independence would help Scotland to take its future into its own hands.She said: Of the 27 independent countries that decided the UK\u0027s future at the EU Council two weeks ago, around a dozen are smaller than or similar in size to Scotland.Many of these countries are also more prosperous than Scotland.With all of our assets and talents, Scotland should be a thriving and driving force within Europe.Instead we face being forced to the margins, sidelined by a UK that is itself increasingly sidelined on the international stage.Nicola Sturgeon says we must learn the lessons of the Brexit mess.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Westminster system of government simply does not serve Scotland\u0027s interests, she adds. The status quo is broken.\u0026nbspCross-party votes of this parliament have been disregarded time and time again and vital powers were taken from this parliament without our consent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFor the first time in 20 years, there is a real risk of devolution going backwards, she warns.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn independence, she says: Independence offers the best future. That case for independence is stronger now... given profound changes since 2016.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt would allow us to protect our place in Europe, she claims, and mean that decisions cannot be imposed on us by Westminster. It would put our future back into our own hands - that is the essence of independence.\u0026nbspShe says a second independence referendum should happen in the lifetime of this parliament - before May 2021.Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is now addressing the Scottish parliament. She says two weeks ago, the EU council extended membership of Britain until October in an effort to avoid a no-deal, and as a result the government has scaled down its planning for a disorderly exit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe risk of no deal will rise again, she says if the impasse is not broken by October.\u0026nbspThe best way to break the deadlock would be to put the issue back to the people in a referendum, she says. It is impossible to predict with certainty what will happen next.\u0026nbspThis chaos was not inevitable, she says. Theresa May boxed herself in with a series of a contradictory red lines.\u0026nbspMore confusion surrounding what the Conservatives will do if – or rather when – they are forced to take part in the European parliament elections on 23 May, writes Rob Merrick.Speaking after prime minister’s questions, Ms May’s spokesman would not say whether the Tories would launch a campaign in the normal way, or even issue a manifesto.On a campaign launch, he replied: “I’m sure if we have one we’ll let you know about it.”\u0026nbspAnd, asked if a manifesto would be published, the spokesman said – after a pause of almost ten seconds – “Those kinds of things will be set out in the usual and familiar way.”Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, asks what representations have been made by the government after Saudi Arabia executed 37 people yesterday, some of who were tortured to extract confessions.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe foreign office minister Alan Duncan replies saying\u0026nbspwe are very concerned about the executions of 37 men, he says, and the UK opposes the death penalty in all circumstances and by all countries. He says Jeremy Hunt will be making representations.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspExecuting 37 people is a deeply backwards step, which we deplore, he adds. One of the grave concerns is that it would appear to include minors, or those who were minors at the time the charges were brought. In the last few minutes, the European Union has issued a very, very strong\u0026nbspstatement. \u0026nbspHe says the actions of Saudi Arabia are utterly unacceptable in the modern world.DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds says the message across Northern Ireland is not acceptable and will not succeed after the murder of Lyra McKee.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLidington says he agrees with every word from Dodds, and the finest riposte to the terrorists was that the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland to utterly condemn their actions.Following the attacks in Sri Lanka and the death of Lyra McKee, DUP MP Sammy Wilson says that Christians across the world are now the most persecuted religious group and asks what the government is doing.\u0026nbspLidington says Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is already working on a project to protect Christians under threat.The first job of any government is to keep our country and citizens safe, Thornberry adds. She asks again for the government to put the option of a customs union on the table in the cross-party Brexit negotiations.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut Lidington says the House has rejected many issues, including the opposition\u0027s proposals.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is also a majority in this chamber for that position and polling evidence suggests a majority in Scotland want a choice on independence, though opinions vary on timing.“There are some who would like to see a very early referendum others want that choice to be much later.”May-Corbyn Brexit deal would ‘make country poorer’, Sturgeon saysRejecting calls for a referendum this year, she continued: “To rush into an immediate decision before a Brexit path has been determined would not allow for an informed choice to be made. However, if we are to safeguard Scotland’s interests, we cannot wait indefinitely.“That is why I consider that a choice between Brexit and a future for Scotland as an independent European nation should be offered in the lifetime of this parliament.“If Scotland is taken out of the EU, the option of a referendum on independence within that timescale must be open to us. That would be our route to avoiding the worst of the damage Brexit will do.”Ms Sturgeon said the UK’s decision to leave the EU had changed the circumstances since the last Scottish independence referendum.Created with Sketch.

Their political graffiti washes away in the night rainShe said: “The case for independence is even stronger now given the profound changes that have taken place in the UK since 2014.“In that time we have seen the limits of Scotland’s influence within the UK and, in sharp contrast to that, the power that independent nations have as members of the EU.“Independence would allow us to protect our place in EU, it would enable us to nurture our\u0026nbspmost important relationships – those with the other countries of the British Isles – on the basis of equality, and it would mean that decisions against our will and contrary to our interests cannot be imposed on us by Westminster.”Any plan for a second vote would need to be approved by the government in London.Theresa May has said she will not agree to another independence poll, but Ms Sturgeon said she was confident that position “will prove to be unsustainable”. The first minister said she was acting now so “we won’t squander valuable time ...\u0026nbspin a standoff with a UK government that may soon be out of office”.She added: “Those who oppose independence are of course entitled to argue that case, but it must be for the people to decide.“If we are successful in further growing the support and the demand for independence,\u0026nbspthen no UK government will be able to deny the will of the people or stop that will being expressed.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Other packages were also found at Heathrow Airport and London City Airport, with the police saying they were bombs. Counterterror officers are investigating the three devices as linked following a series of evacuations. One of the packages opened by office staff at Heathrow Airport burst into flames. Scotland Yard did not rule out the existence of other bombs. “The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices,” a spokesperson said. “These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened. “The Met Police Counter Terrorism Command is treating the incidents as a linked series and is keeping an open mind regarding motives.”Regional differences were also reported, with a disadvantaged young person in the North East being 50 per cent\u0026nbspmore likely to end up Neet than a disadvantaged young person in London.Impetus chief executive Andy Ratcliffe said: “We\u0027ve all heard the good news about record levels of youth employment. Our data lets us look beneath the headline figures at what is happening to young people from different backgrounds, in different parts of the country, and with different qualifications, and, for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, this is not a good news story.“We are breaking a fundamental promise to young people in this country. We tell them: \u0027Study hard, get your qualifications and good jobs will follow\u0027.“For many young people this is true, but for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds it isn\u0027t. They are less likely to get those qualifications, and even when they do, less likely to benefit.”Stefan Speckesser, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which helped with the study, said: “By showing regional and local differences in the employment gap, we find evidence that some local areas are more successfully tackling the negative effects of disadvantage, which are unrelated to education success, on young people\u0027s school-to-work transitions.”The findings, involving 18 to 24-year-old Neets in England, are drawn from Education Department data.Shadow employment minister Mike Amesbury said: “This report must act as a wake-up call to the Government. Young people who have grown up in poverty can face significant disadvantages when they come to look for their first job.“The Tory Party is failing young people, who are too often trapped in low-paid and insecure work, but the Government is refusing to track whether or not its flagship youth employment programme, the Youth Obligation, is working.”Mark Hawthorne, of the Local Government Association, said: “The Government needs to consider LGA proposals for an integrated employment and skills service led by local authorities.“Devolving careers advice, post-16 and adult skills budgets and powers to local areas would allow councils, schools, colleges and employers to work together to improve provision for young people so that they can get on in life.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We demand the Government makes the following changes to help hard-working famililes before its too late. We want you to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Things have not improved for the former housekeeper, who has been forced to borrow money to pay for furniture and did not have enough cash to celebrate her eight-year-old son’s birthday.“I got my son a little truck for his birthday but that was it, she said. “He was happy to get something as I’ve had to sell the toys he has just to charge the electric and the gas,”Charlotte charges men £ for sex and other favours - bringing in around £ every week. She sees one client whenever she can as she appreciates the “regular” work.In fact, the mum feels so let down by the Government she claims her clients are the only people she can trust.Charlotte, who lives on an estate, had to give up her job when she had her son because she couldnt afford childcare.She moved onto Universal Credit in January  but fell £ behind on her rent while waiting for her first payment and was threatened with eviction.She says: “If I didn’t have to wait so long for my first payment, I would have been OK.“Something always goes wrong - five weeks is too much. I’m still just about managing now.“Winter has been hard, I’ve had to keep the house warm and the lights on, but it’s been so expensive to do.Her sons dad pays nothing towards his upkeep and while she received a £ loan from the government to tide her over when she moved onto Universal Credit last year, she claims she wasn’t told by her local job centre that it would need to be repaid.“That was the final straw when everything changed, and I saw how much debt I was in… the payments and the household bills, it all built up,” she says.Charlotte now receives £-a-month in Universal Credit after her rent has been paid to her landlord and her debts, including the £ furniture loan, are taken off.At one point, after shed paid the rest of her bills, she was left with just £. a day for her and her son to live on.Other women have also claimed that a long wait for their first Universal Credit payment has forced them into sex work.Julie, , from Merseyside told the BBC she had been left “so ashamed” after being forced to turn to sex work after an EIGHT-week wait for her Universal Credit payment.“I didnt go out looking for it, I said no at first ... it wasnt until about three weeks later that I said OK, yeah, because I thought I need to, because I need money’,” she said.Its something I never ever thought I would be ever capable of doing.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussell Trust website.Women like Charlotte are often too ashamed to tell their families that they have resorted to prostitution to survive.“I can’t talk to anyone. It’s the guilt mainly. My family don’t know - they wouldn’t be happy. They’d be angry, furious, upset. They would be so judgemental.My son still doesn’t know about what I do for money either.”“And I’m sure there are other women out there in worse situations than me.”Charlotte is struggling with her mental health at the moment and is having therapy for a second time – but she hasn’t admitted what she “does on the side” as she doesn’t think her counsellor would understand.She is considering going to college to do a course as she wants to be an author, but feels things are stacked against her.“I know I’ve got lots to work on, but it’s too much sometimes,” she says.“I keep thinking, why is this happening “They say Universal Credit is working, but who is that for Why are people getting poorer but the government don’t care  Evensomething changes, I can’t erase what I’ve done now.Officials say that advances are available from day one on Universal Credit - and that Brits can get up to  per cent of their cash upfrontthey need it.But delays getting the welfare payments are causing women to rack up debt and some are selling their bodies while they wait for help, charities have said.We know from the stories of women that have contacted us that the delays in processing universal credit and the drop in benefits is financially crippling.It is essential that the vulnerable are protected and their welfare is paramount.”A representative for Beyond The Streets, which works to help women who have suffered sexual exploitation, said: We welcome the investigation in to failures in universal credit and the increase in survival sex.In October, MP Frank Field shocked the House of Commons when he revealed women in his Birkenhead constituency were selling themselves for sex for the first time as a result of hardship caused by the introduction of Universal Credit.After The Sun shared Charlottes story with Mr Field, he said he would write to Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd about her case.Here we have yet another awful example of Universal Credit pushing vulnerable mothers, who are trying to protect their children, to rock bottom and beyond, he told The Sun.The DWP insists safeguards are in place to make sure all repayments are affordable and sustainable.It also aims to give people help to find routes out of the sex industry, with personalised work coaches in place to help people looking for alternative roles.The department insists it has responded quickly to feedback on Universal Credit by continuing to pay Housing Benefit for two weeks after people move on to the new system. Other legacy benefits will follow suit shortly.Ms Rudd has responded to the Suns campaign, saying shes listening to Sun readers as she tries to improve Universal Credit for working families.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: We’re committed to getting help to people when they need it most, and advance payments and budgeting support are available.Work coaches are trained to spot vulnerable people, including those working in the sex industry, and offer appropriate support.”*Charlottes name has been changed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

None of them are free.Leaders from across our faith communities are standing together to speak out against slavery.Last year the Church of England and the Catholic Church launched the Safe Car Wash App to help drivers report slavery at car washes — one industry alone that’s thought to have thousands of enslaved workers.After just six months, users have reported over , suspected cases, helping the police to tackle this plague.In my own Diocese I know there is crucially important work going on to support these victims.At All Souls Church in Langham Place, at the heart of the West End, the charity Tamar provides essential support and advocacy by reaching out to women who are suffering through sexual exploitation.Tamar takes inspiration from the two stories of women in the Bible being badly mistreated by men and society,The appeal has built on the work of the Clewer Initiative, which has called for a community -wide response to modern slavery — developing partnerships between the Church, statutory and non-statutory agencies, to create a network of advocates seeking to end modern day slavery.As we celebrate the new le of Jesus Christ, let us remember that new le comes not just after death but for those that are living.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just  days support after being freed before they are expected to leave the UK and are deported by the Home Office.During this short time, they are given accommodation, financial aid, medical treatment, counselling, a support worker, a translator and legal advice.We want the government to: Back Lord McColls proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a years support to recover.Alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial help and other services.This week’s devastation of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and the remarkable demonstrations of solidarity and generosity that have emerged in its aftermath, are testament to the power of community and show the spirit of resurrection in action.If we could apply that same spirit to the terrible injustice of slavery in our communities, through working together, looking closely for what is hidden in plain sight, and supporting the excellent work of charities, we can give new le to those thousands of victims of modern slavery.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This was not a poll of wider Tory voters but of people who pay an annual subscription to the party.If this group of around , people are not prepared to vote for their own party, then what chance have the Tories in attracting votes from the wider electorate But it gets worse — even elected Tory representatives are planning to rat on their party in the European elections.A Survation poll suggests that four in ten Conservative councillors are planning to back the Brexit Party too.Loyalty, it used to be said, was the Tories’ secret weapon.Not any more.The party has become like an army whose frontline troops have started burrowing beneath enemy lines — not in order to plant explosives beneath its positions, but in the hope of joining it in its trenches.No Conservative leader will find it easy to turn around the situation, but at least a new face, with some new ideas and a fresh perspective on how to solve the Brexit impasse, would have a chance.Anything would be better than being led round and round in circles by a Prime Minister who has become tired and stuck.Every time May comes to the despatch box after some new, devastating vote in the Commons, I find myself thinking: Surely she must have a fresh strategy now.Then I find myself groaning to learn that no, still she seems to think that the answer is to keep on plugging her failed deal.To huge numbers of British people, May has become a large part of the problem.What was once seen as her greatest asset — resilience — is now seen as plain stubbornness.It has become impossible to imagine any satisfactory outcome to Brexit until she is gone.Sadly, I fear that May herself cannot see this.Like John Major in the last, wretched years of his premiership, I fear she has convinced herself that she is an asset to her party and her country when almost everyone  can see that the opposite is true.As with Major in the mid s, every day that May remains in Downing Street is adding to the scale of defeat the party faces at the ballot box.The only dference is that then the beneficiary was the moderate Tony Blair.This time around, an unpopular but stubborn Tory leader is adding rocket fuel to the chances of an unreformed Marxist, Jeremy Corbyn, becoming Prime Minister.I know May is desperate to achieve some sort of legacy before she leaves Downing Street, butshe resists much longer her main achievement will be an indirect one — it will be to let in a Labour government which s Britain to the sort of punitive tax rates which drove a brain drain of iniduals and businesses from the country in the s.It is a great shame that May did not resign last December, when  of her MPs voted against her in a confidence vote.Her margin of victory — she won  per cent of votes — would have constituted a substantial mandate in an open leadership contest.But this was not a leadership contest.It was a no-confidence vote in a sitting Prime Minister, in which anything less than a resounding victory would have been unsatisfactory.Given that more than  Conservative MPs are members of the Government — and were therefore duty bound to support their Prime Minister in a confidence vote — May failed even to carry with her a majority of her backbenchers.And that was before the multiple Commons defeats for her deal, which have led to open rebellion in the Cabinet.Were such a vote to be held now, it is inevitable that many ministers who reluctantly backed her in December would no longer feel they needed to do so.Under the Conservative Party’s rules, May cannot be challenged again in a no-confidence vote for a full  months after the last one. But there are rumblings to change this rule.Graham Brady, Chairman of the  Committee, which represents backbenchers, is reported to be planning to visit May next week to tell her to resign before the end of June.But that won’t be soon enough.

The gadgets send pulses to the heart to keep it beating regularly.They are the size of a matchbox, fit in the chest, and consist of a battery, tiny computer circuit and wires, which attach to the heart.Dr Wang said: “Millions of patients rely on implantable medical electronic devices.“However, their batteries are generally bulky, rigid, and have short letimes. Power source has impeded the progress of IMEDs.”British experts welcomed the “exciting” breakthrough but warned it could be some years before the devices are ready for human use.This is because they need to be shown to be safe and capable of generating and storing enough power over the long-term.Prof Tim Chico, from the University of Sheffield, said: “Millions of patients undergo insertion of pacemakers to treat fast or slow heart rhythms.“These are very effective but unfortunately battery le is limited. To replace the battery requires another operation every few years which poses a risk of infection.”Prof Jeremy Pearson, from the British Heart Foundation, said: “This innovative technology moves us closer to a pacemaker that needs no batteries.“Despite being an exciting development, much more research is needed.”The energy harvest device needs to be inserted around the heart in open heart surgery, which is more invasive than current practice.This could mean some patients are unsuitable for it.The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But when you’re a murdering psycho, you want to wreak terror not just on those present, but in the minds of millions around the world.And the way they do that is to target innocent people in the normal, everyday scenarios we can all identy with.Attending a church or mosque with family and friends, taking our kids to a concert or a busy shopping mall at the weekend, cheering on marathon runners, queuing for breakfast at a holiday hotel . . .Who among us has not read about Sneha and her friends . . .  or the heartbreaking stories of the British father who lost his we and two children . . . or the Danish man who lost three of his four children . . . and thought of how we would copefaced with the same situation That’s terrorism. It projects fear on to the masses and seeks to make us alter our behaviour accordingly.With every fibre of my being, I want to resist the power of this pernicious tactic, but of late I’ll admit I have struggled.On Friday night, our -year-old attended a Shawn Mendes concert at London’s O arena with a friend and her mother. We wrestled with whether to let her go or not, then felt anxious from the moment she set off until she ed home.Equally, when she expressed a wish to meet her friends at a vast mall last week, we urged her to give it a miss and browse the shops locally. Irrational, yes, but that’s what terrorism can do to your mindsetyou let it.You don’t want to be that grieving family, so you try to minimise the chances of it happening.The truth, of course, is thata suicide bomber decides to board your train carriage, or walk in to your community centre, or drive a car that blows up just as you’re walking past — there’s not a damn thing you can do about it.But what we can do is stand together in our firm belief that these attacks — be it on churches or mosques — have nothing to do with religion.Just hours after the coordinated bombings in his country, the Sri Lankan minister of state for defence said preliminary investigations have shown, “this attack was carried out in retaliation for the attack against Muslims in Christchurch [New Zealand]”.Meanwhile, reports have emerged of young Christian men walking the streets near Sneha’s home of Negombo carrying long sticks and “looking for Muslims”.Again, this us-against-them mindset is what terrorism seeks to inflame.But this isn’t about Christianity versus Islam.The attacks in Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Manchester and London — to name but a few — are the actions of a warped few who have distorted the teachings of wholly peaceful religions to suit their own, murderous ends.We mustn’t allow one drop of poison to contaminate an ocean of humanity.DR GAIL BRADBROOK is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the eco action group that brought central London to a virtual standstill last week.She says: “I think our protests have been awesome.“We’re making history at the minute, people are having a fantastic time on the streets and we really welcome people to come join us.”Yes, I’m sure workers on zero hours contracts would relish the opportunity to lose a day’s payto join her, so too the nurses whose arrival at nearby St Thomas’ hospital each day is critical to the wellbeing of thousands of patients.Dr Bradbrook may have a PhD in molecular biophysics but one fears she and her merry band of protestors may have skipped lessons in common sense.Why  would they glue themselves to public transport that encourages people to leave their cars at home while simultaneously causing air polluting traffic jams And why  would they stage a sit-in aimed to make the politicians take notice when the House of Commons rose on April  for recess and didn’tuntil yesterday  Duh.The majority of the population supports action on climate change, but this virtue-signalling nonsense only detracts from the cause by irritating ordinary people just tryingto earn a living. Begging the question: Why only now HOLLYWOOD star Anne Hathaway says she’s giving up alcohol until her son is .She’s a stronger woman than me.Meanwhile, she has also abandoned veganism after admitting that she “just didn’t feel good or healthy”. She says she immediately felt betterafter eating a fish dish from Iceland.I know what you’re thinking . . . was it the £ prawn ring as advertised by Kerry Katona No, Anne’s le-changing fish experience was a sustainably sourced salmon at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Reykjavik.Easy mistake to make though.“HEALTH tourism” is still an ongoing issue, with reports that ten people a day are jetting to the UK to have their babies delivered on the NHS.The bill for caring for , foreign maternity cases was around £.million in  , with only £.million of it clawed back.Meanwhile, three-year-old Victoria Komada, from Norwich, was born with twisted legs and faced a double amputation.And thanks only to the generosity of the local community in Norwich and those in Poland’s Szczecin, where her parents grew up, £, was raised for her to fly toFlorida for an operation to help her walk. Each week we see the plight of desperate people trying to raise money for treatments the NHS won’t fund.Just think of how many of them that unrecouped £.million might have helped.Some days, it feels like we in the UK have  of them.CERTAIN IVF clinics are exploiting older women whose chances of having a baby are very poor, the fertility regulator has warned.Since , the number of -plus women having IVF has doubled, with some clinics “trading on hope” despite a success rate of just one per cent for a woman of  using her own eggs.A spokeswoman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authoritysaid she would like these clinics to be honest about the low statistics.She’s right, but one suspects the number of older women opting for IVF will remain high.Because when you’re desperate for a child, even in a fertility lottery of just one per cent, there still lies the hope that it could be you.Fast forward years and they’re still performing though, despite a healthy diet and regular exercise, the batteries are running noticeably lower.

for those aged three and four.Youngsters should also not spend periods of longer than an hour in car seats, high chairs, prams or carriers, according to the guidelines aimed at under-s.WHO experts admit the strict limits may be hard for busy parents to enforce – but said the benefits outweigh any potential harms.The guidance concludes: “Physical inactivity has been identied as a leading risk factor for global mortality and a contributor to the rise in overweight and obesity.“Sedentary behaviours, whether riding motorised transport rather than walking or cycling, sitting at a desk in school, watching TV or playing inactive screen-based games are increasingly prevalent and associated with poor health outcomes.”Earlier this year, the nation’s top doctors said TVs should be turned off every couple of hours and phones put away during meal times.In the first official UK advice on screen time, the Government’s medical advisers said parents must ensure devices do not interfere with children’s sleep, exercise and education.But the Chief Medical Officers’ report fell short of stating a “safe” amount of daily use due to a lack of scientic evidence.New advice from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health also opposes screen time limits.Responding to the new guidance, Dr Max Davie from the RCPCH, warned blunt limits may have “unintended consequences”.He said: “While it is important for children to be as active as possible, the barriers are more frequently to do with housing, work patterns, family stress, and lack of access to play spaces rather than actively choosing to be sedentary.“The restricted screen time limits suggested by the WHO do not seem proportionate to the potential harm.“Currently there is not strong enough evidence to support the setting of screen time limits.“Also, it is dficult to see how a household with mixed-age children can shield a baby from any screen exposure at all.”The WHO guidance also states kids aged one to four should get around  hours sleep daily.Dr Mike Brannan, from Public Health England, said: “Being active plays an important role in good health and development from an early age.“We need to help our children move more and sit less – every movement counts, whether playing, dancing or walking.”"},{"url":null,"title":"doctor tied up passengers open emergency exit flight","story":"Russian anaesthetist Vadim Bondar was overpowered by male passengers after causing terror on the Aeroflot flight from Bangkok to Moscow.They tied him with a belt, and he remained restrained for four hours before the aircraft landed safely in Moscow.The  year old “foul-mouthed and violent” medic had been drinking rum on the ten hour flight even though the airline bans alcohol in economy class on this route, said witnesses.According to local media, the extremely aggressive doctor was seeking to open the emergency exit.One passenger said: “He had two bottles of alcohol on him and at some point tried to open an emergency exit.“The crew and fellow passengers tried to calm him down, but he kept screaming and yelling.“He cried when his arms and hands were bound.“He kept sobbing and saying My hands are tied, I cant breathe.”Aeroflot spokeswoman Vera Abanina said: “The economy class passenger while quite obviously drunk was rudely violating public order.“He was extremely aggressive, threatening and humiliating the flight attendants.“He screamed and did everything to create maximum discomfort to other flight passengers.Two bottles of alcohol were found and confiscated from the passenger.“He did not react to verbal and written warnings from the crew.“Other passengers and the crew acted together and fixed the rule breaker in a seat using whatever means they managed to find until the end of the flight.”The “air hooligan” was handed to police on arrival in Moscow and underwent a medical check.A decision will be made on any charges.Russia’s top criminal investigator Alexander Bastrykin, head of the Russian Investigative Committee, personally intervened to demand a full probe into what happened on the flight.Dr Bondar admitted he did drink rum but “only to pass the time while the plane was going through turbulence”.He later told journalists: “Perhaps I asked the flight attendants too often for water.

The -year-old - who has defected to stand for the Brexit Party in South West England on May  - has a string of comments to her name which have landed her in hot water.And she has had plenty of time to rack them up, spending  years in the Tory party and rising to the ranks of Shadow Home Secretary. From supporting abhorrent so-called gay cure therapy to backing the shackling of pregnant prisoners, here are some of the more controversial acts to her name. In  she defended gay conversion therapy - which Theresa May has branded abhorrent and vowed to ban.She blamed the homosexual lobby for turning all its fire on conversion therapy adding: The unhappy homosexual should, according to gay activists, be denied any chance whatever to investigate any possibility of seeinghe can be helped to become heterosexual. If anybody turns to a properly qualied practitioner for help there must be a presumption that he or she can get it. It is not a state crime to want to change oneaposs sexual leanings. Yet. A Stonewall spokesperson said: Any form of ‘therapy’ that attempts to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity is unethical and wrong. These so-called conversion therapies have been condemned by all major UK health organisations as they try to shame a person into denying a core part of who they are, and this can have a seriously harmful impact on their mental health and wellbeing. Same-sex attraction is natural, normal and not something that can or should be ‘cured’. . She backed chaining up pregnant prisoners  As a Shadow Home Office minister in , Ms Widdecombe infamously defended the practice of chaining up female prisoners in jail. Labouraposs Jack Straw said it was inhuman, degrading and unnecessary for a prisoner to be shackled at any stage of labour. And the Royal College of Midwives said the policy put the health of mothers and babies at risk. Yet despite the outcry, she claimed pregnant women could escape with one jumping from a first floor window during an antenatal appointment. She told MPs: We remove restraints when treatment has commenced or, in the case of pregnant women, when labour is confirmed. We regard that as striking the right balance between the need to maintain security and the need to recognise the motheraposs situation. . She left the Church of England in protest at female priests  Ms Widdecombe famously left the Church of England and joined the Catholic church in  - in protest at the decision to ordain female priests. Even in  she was unrepentant, saying itaposs theologically impossible to ordain women. She told the New Statesman: The ordination of women was the last straw, but it was only one of many.

As far as the Catholic Church is concerneditaposs true itaposs true, anditaposs  itaposs . . She voted against a whole string of gay rights  Ms Widdecombe has persistently voted against LGBT rights and equality. Those included voted against equalising the age of consent at , civil partnerships and the repeal of Section . In  she told MPs she rejected the idea that there is somehow equal validity between the homosexual lestyle and marriage and family.Last year she was branded homophobic by drag star Courtney Act when they both appeared on Celebrity Big Brother .

Talks between their two parties on Brexit are deadlocked  and it is hard to find anyone in Westminster who believes an agreement can be reached. Mrs May is now running out of options on Brexit. One possibility under consideration is to put the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before Parliament and defy MPs to vote it down. It is hard to see how this will work when,anything, Tory opposition to the agreement has hardened since the emergence of Farage’s Brexit Party.   The Brexit Party has a slick media operation, momentum and, as of this morning,  the backing of Ann Widdecombe who will be standing as a candidate in the Europe elections .  The former Conservative minister said she felt “compelled” to come out of retirement in order to deliver the referendum result.  Herto frontline politics may or may not be what a weary nation has been wishing for. Success in the European elections would buy the Brexit Party two important commodities: money and exposure.  The generous funding of MEPs can be used to help bankroll domestic campaigns, while broadcasting regulations also require the TV stations to give air time to parties with elected representatives. Farage’s new outfit is benefiting from being a single issue party. So far the Brexit Party has been deliberately reticent about setting out any policies beyond its Ronseal-style name. Voters attracted to the party may want to ask whether Farage is still in favour of privatising the NHS, scrapping some racial equality laws and axing parental rights. They may also want to think twice before lending support to someone who has addressed a rally by the hard-right Alternative for Germany party and is an apologist for the National Front in France.Perhaps this is the spiritual home of Ms Widdecombe who voted against repealing Section , introducing the Equality Act and civil partnerships.

Welcome back, terror, hate, hypocrisy and very poor thought processes: how we havenapost missed you. A nation that decriminalised homosexuality  years ago is being told to vote for a woman who thinks homosexuals can be aposcuredapos. A nation that came up with a brilliant solution to a vicious -year conflict is being told it should do the one thing guaranteed to restart it. And a nation which established the welfare state  years ago is marking the anniversary by making the poorest % of its people poorer still. People are ided on whether there is any such place as hell but there is no way this road leads anywhere good.  During the Brexit referendum, we were warned that a vote to leave the European Union would give the dormant IRA and its dissident children fuel for their fires. Four months ago the New IRA set off a car bomb in Derry. Six weeks ago it sent letter bombs to British airports, a train station and an army recruitment centre. And six days ago it murdered journalist Lyra McKee, who had committed the atrocious crime of reporting on the riots that followed a police raid on suspected terrorist arms caches.Itaposs her funeral today. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are attending the official goodbye to a -year-old woman whose too-few words always made more sense than their own. Perhaps they will have the self-awareness to note that the Brexit they have, between them, wanted for years handed her killers their best recruitment tool in decades. The threat of border controls has sown resentment and belligerence in a handful of hearts, and the old Provos are now able to persuade young idiots to join them.While May and Corbyn wrestle the intellectual issues like two recalcitrant ducks, two new parties have formed to fight the upcoming EU elections. One is Change UK, which has a funny tinge of twats about it. The other is the Brexit Party, which has not so much a tinge as an absolute shower of precisely the sort of morons you thought Britain had decided to ignore.Step forward travelling DJ Nigel Farage, whose recent lack of attention on international speaking tours has led him to throw himself before the TV cameras in an attempt to get his last job back.  If you think hating the EU would logically lead to boycotting it, think again. Farage made £, a year out of the organisation while failing to take part in much of its work. No-one appears to have asked him how, exactly, he thinks being re-elected to an institution he loathes will destroy it, but perhaps he self-identies as a virus now.Or maybe heaposs trying to recoup the £, he was docked for mis-spending EU funds. Money which came from the UK taxpayer, originally. By his side is the joyless, self-publicising wannabe nun Ann Widdecombe, a woman who described reality TV as vulgar and voyeuristic before raking in fees for appearing on Celebrity Big Brother, Strictly Come Dancing, Celebrity Fit Club, Celebrity Antiques Road Trip,  Hours In The Past, Sugar-Free Farm, four pantomimes and Ann Widdecombe Investigates. Harder to stomach than her hypocrisy is her intolerance. In  she said homosexuals should be helped to become heterosexual. Itaposs unclear what qualications her properly qualied professional would need, but presumably being openly nasty is one of them.

Your Move boss Helen Buck was confronted by a Commons committee after she claimed we donapost have any adverts that say aposNo DSSapos.With just a quick Google search, MPs found a string of Your Move ads that excluded DSS - which is a reference to the former name of the Department for Work and Pensions.One even said benefit claimants were not welcome but small dogs would be considered. Ms Buck - who is executive director of Your Moveaposs parent from LSL Property Services - admitted the adverts were shocking and not acceptable.    She told MPs: I will need to go back and I will need to make sure those adverts are not appearing. We certainly have a policy of not having ‘No DSS’ adverts. It comes just weeks after the government vowed to eradicate aposNo DSSapos rental adverts. Ministers are meeting mortgage lenders, landlord associations and tenant groups to stop the unfair exclusion of tenants in receipt of housing support.Zoopla also became the first agent to ban rental ads that block benefit claimants last month.Ms Buck was quizzed by the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, which questioned tenants and letting agents as part of a probe into aposNo DSSapos adverts. The boss of LSL, whose brands also include Reeds Rains and Marsh  Parsons, told MPs: We don’t have any adverts that say No DSS.But SNP MP Chris Stephens said: That’s interesting you say that Helen, because Shelter provided us with some adverts from March  which say ‘No DSS’. A bedroom property to rent in Essex - No DSS. A property to rent West Yorkshire - No DSS. Property to rent in Romford - No DSS. And my favourite one- one-bedroom property to rent in Telford, sorry No DSS. Small dogs considered. Presumably the small dog has to provide some proof of income  He added: Do you consider adverts like that to be legal or illegal  Ms Buck said she would not have a problem with making such adverts illegal. She added: We do have to recognise that some of our landlords either can’t accept a tenant in receipt of benefit.. or we have landlords who may choose that they don’t wish to.  That’s where I believe we can play a rolewe understand the system better of helping landlords to understand why they should broaden [out]. But Adam Hyslop, founder of OpenRent, admitted his site carries aposNo DSSapos adverts - and argued they should stay legal. He told MPs it was to stop tenants wasting time on properties where they don’t actually stand a chance of being accepted. He added: The worst thing to do here would be to actually ban the terminology around benefit claimants without sorting the underlying issues. “Simply prohibiting phrases in adverts would just prohibit us from advertising properties accurately.”Glynis Frew, chief executive of Hunters Property Group, told MPs landlords were reluctant to take benefit claimants because of soaring arrears under Universal Credit . “Arrears are increasing. All the data says they are increasing to the tune of about £,, she said. “So you can’t expect an inidual just to bear that cost.” She added it would be “safer” to pay Universal Credit directly to landlords, rather than to tenants. Speaking after the hearing Ms Buck said: We welcomed the opportunity to attend the Work and Pensions Select Committee. Your Move does not discriminate against tenants in receipt of benefits.

Around , people put their savings, retirement cash and inheritance into LCF , which is now in administration and under investigation for mis-selling high-risk bonds as ISAs. They fear they will never get their full savings back. The Serious Fraud Office, working in conjunction with the Financial Conduct Authority, is now investigating iniduals associated with LCF and four people have been arrested.    The BBC has revealed today how Mr Merceraposs private salary, which works out at £ an hour, has been funded by the failed bond schemeaposs marketing agent. Neither the MP or Surge, which was authorised by the FCA, have been accused of any wrong-doing. Mr Mercer said he would not be resigning and insists he has never met, heard of, or had any interest in LCF and said there was a co-ordinated effort to go after me. But some savers who lost money told the BBC they were angry that some of their money was now funding the Tory MPaposs salary. Amanda Cunningham was trying to save money for her autistic son when she lost more than £, investing in LCF. Politicians are there for the people, and Johnny Mercer is not thinking about the people, she said. Mr Mercer said he would support bondholders in any future action they take to try and recover their position. Peter Wright, who invested £, of his weaposs money into the scheme, added: Heaposs involved with a company like Surge, which took a quarter of my money for putting adverts on the web recommending LCF as their top buy. The long-time Conservative supporter said he had lost all faith in Parliament. The BBCaposs investigation found that The Crucial Group, which owns Crucial Academy Limited, was loaned £, by The Surge Group.    The Surge Groupaposs accounts, filed with Companies House, reveal nearly £million was loaned to it from Surge Financial, without which, auditors said, the company would be unlikely to survive. The Surge Group and Surge Financial Limited are both owned by entrepreneur Paul Careless. Mr Mercer said in a statement on social media: Clearly there is some co-ordinated effort to go after me at present - the reasons for which are unclear. Let me very clear from the outset: I totally reject the assertion that I have done anything wrong in working as a non-executive director of Crucial Academy. This is a training academy that trains veterans from the Armed Forces with particular specialist skills in cyber security, and places them with major companies. There are many similar endeavours, particularly in the US. It is possible to draw a link between an inidual and any number of companies. This has been done by the BBC between Crucial Academy and London Capital and Finance- through two other companies. I have sought rigorous assurances that at no stage was capital used from any business with LCF, in Crucial Academy. I received those assurances. It now appears there is a historical link between the two, that has been uncovered in the accounts when Surge Group loaned the Crucial Group £,. Clearly I had no role in this, joining the Academy last autumn. When this historic link was discovered, the leadership of Crucial Academy immediately implemented a management buy-out and the loan was repaid, in order to ensure the continuing integrity of Crucial Academy. I aposgetapos that this is an attempt to tie me to another company - London Capital and Finance - that has imploded, amid allegations of fraud. I have never met, herd of, or had any interest in this company previously, yet alone the financial products they offered. I have huge sympathies with bondholders, and would support them in any future action they take to try and recover their position. But let me be clear: Crucial Academy is a good organisation, doing good things, run by good people, with no financial link to London Capital and Finance. I have no intention of resigning or cutting them adrt in this storm. Neil and the team are working tirelessly to ensure the integrity of this young and growing organisation, and I support them wholeheartedly in that. The wider context of calling out deliberate efforts to smear by by so-called colleagues in the House of Commons, and then this story appearing so soon afterwards, I will leave for others to judge. Surge claimed in a previous statement that Crucial Academy was unrelated to both Surge Financial and LCF.    A spokesperson added: Surge Financial Limited provided LCF with a full outsourced range of services over a number of years. These ceased when LCF entered administration in January . “Surge has a number of clients and its fees for LCF are in line with the industry standard. “LCF was an FCA regulated business and it signed off all marketing materials and financial promotions prior to publication, as required by FSMA section . “Surge was a supplier of services used in relation to raising investment for LCF. It did not handle client money and had no involvement in the deployment of funds to borrowing companies.” "},{"url":null,"title":"adorable blind dog guide dog","story":"NewsAdorable blind dog has his own guide dog and theyve become best friendsAmos and Toby are inseparable with Toby defending blind Amos from other dogs and helping him find his water bowlShareCommentsByAliki Kraterou:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video blind-dog-guide-dog-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis adorable blind pooch has his own guide dog, who helps him navigate, and has become his best friend. Amos, a staffy cross and Toby, nine, a border terrier, have been inseparable for the past year, with Toby defending Amos from other dogs and even help him find his water bowl. Jess Martin, , who works in HR for the Cheshire Fire and Rescue service, adopted Amos in August last year from the rescue centre she was volunteering at. Although initially Toby was a bit wary of Amos, he ended up loving him and protecting him – and being his only friend. Jess has had Toby for the past nine years, as he was her th birthday present from her parents and she only adopted Amos last year, when he was born at the dogsapos home, where she was a volunteer.    Amos was born blind, along with one of his sisters and Jess knew it would be tricky finding a home for him. Jess said: “Toby was the best present I ever got. “He is very independent, and he likes his own space so we were a bit concerned to see how accepting he would be of Amos. “I thought it would be very dficult to find an owner and while Amos was on medical care for four months, we decided to foster him in February last year but after a while we realised we would never give him back.    “At the beginning Toby growled at him a few times and then ignored him- Amos came from a kennel so doesn’t know how to socialise with other dogs. “After a couple of days, I saw that Amos couldn’t find his water bowl and Toby nudged him and helped him out.” Jess and her partner Billy Howe, ,a cargo agent, decided to adopt the pup in August , seeing that Toby got used him and even ended up becoming his only friend.    Amos needed to have an eye operation to have his eyes removed but thankfully he had Toby who didn’t leave his side and was very protective of him. Since then the two backpackers go on many adventures together and Amos nudges Toby every time he needs some help. Jess added: “When we went out on walks Amos was very scared, especially of the noises and Toby quickly picked up that he needed help – so every time Amos was stopping, Toby would go and lie next to him till he would be ready.  “They have developed a nice communication between them, and they know each other’s boundaries. “Amos’s main problem is that other dogs don’t like him when they approach him, obviously because he cannot communicate the same way, so he doesn’t have other friends. “Amos is still a bit worried when he is outside in busy areas – that’s why we all go on adventures so he can get used to the great outdoors in a more quiet setting” “Toby is always there to protect him – we call him his ‘bodyguard’.

Bernadette Adams, , was supposed to be looking after a toddler and a -year-old boy at the house, however she was actually spending time with her -year-old partner David Taylor several miles away. Police found the children wandering around the squalid property, in Aberuthven, Perthshire, Scotland, while carrying out a separate investigation. Perth Sherf Court heard how the property stank of urine and that a childaposs bath was being used as a cat litter tray. Sherf Lindsay Foulis deferred sentence on Adams today and told her that he was keeping all options open because of the serious nature of the offence.    He said: There are far too many young people who, unfortunately, experience such scenarios and often these matters end in tragedy for the child or children. Police officers probing a firebomb attack on a car owned by Adamsapos former lover David Elliot found the children moving around the house unsupervised. Adams admitted neglecting the boys on  May last year at the same time she was reportedly seen near Mr Elliotaposs blazing car  miles away in Perth. Adams, once branded a gold-digger for secretly marrying an eccentric pensioner more than  years her senior, admitted exposing the boys to unnecessary suffering or injury. The defendant accepted she had left them in a house with clothes piled up on the floor, dangerous medicine within their reach, and exposed to a cat litter tray overflowing with excrement. The charge stated she had left them in the care of a teenage boy. Adams, who has previously been sued by senior Catholic priests over another filthy rented flat, also admitted acting in a threatening or abusive manner towards Mr Elliot on  December last year.    Fiscal depute Michael Sweeney told Perth Sherf Court: Beds were being used by a cat and there was a repugnant smell of cat urine throughout the property. There were bin bags piled within the garden, to such an extent that officers commented this was a health hazard and,not already, could have caused a vermin infestation. It was a struggle to enter the utility room because of the quantity of dirty clothes piled on the floor. Dirty clothes were piled high obstructing the walkway on the landing. Officers had initially struggled to gain entry and had to knock repeatedly before the children allowed them into the property. The youngsters were described as being left to roam the property. The court was told that Adams and Taylor were seen driving off from the scene of the firebombing and were later found with traces of white spirit on their hands. Street sweeper Mr Elliot said he and Adams had an acrimonious relationship and said: When I opened the front door I saw my car in flames. It was popping and exploding. It was well ablaze. You could tell the heat from it was intense. Within three minutes the whole of the car was a ball of flames. As I looked up the street I saw my ex-partneraposs car driving away from the scene. Maybe she wanted a good look at what she had done. The car didnapost catch fire by itself. The car was a burnt out charred mess. The court was told that a three-quarter full bottle of white spirit was found in the coupleaposs car and that it appeared to be covered in soot. Mr Elliotaposs car was destroyed in the blaze but Sherf Lindsay Foulis found the charge of wilful fireraising against them both not proven. In , a group of Scotlandaposs leading Catholic priests won a legal bid to have Adams evicted from a rental property owned by the church and pay them £,. When she was , Adams secretly married wealthy pensioner Maurice du valois Watson - who was in his late s. Friends of the pensioner, who inherited several hundred thousand pounds from his brother, stepped in and enlisted lawyers to bring the marriage to an end. In , Adams, Park Terrace, Auchterarder, was convicted of frightening her elderly husband by threatening to have his dog killed and demanding that he hand cash over to her.

Richard Barnes was admitted to hospital after suffering from an aching leg but was soon left fighting for his le in intensive care.His condition was so bad that his family said goodbye to him as he lay in a coma in hospital, DevonLive reported . Not only had he contracted sepsis and a flesh eating virus, but doctors also discovered he had a rare form of cancer.Miraculously, Richard survived his battle and is now cancer free - much to the amazement of his doctors. Richard, , from Ilfracombe, had visited North Devon District Hospital with a sore leg on the morning of June  last year.    That was when his nightmare ordeal began. Richard said: “I am relatively active, in fact the previous weekend my we and I had walked  miles from Heddons Mouth to Watersmeet along the coastal path and back again.  But on arrival at AE, having been driven by my we Ali, my leg was feeling worse and started to swell. This is the last thing I remember, I was unconscious for the next two weeks. Luckily for me the amazing staff at AE quickly realised the situation was serious and fast tracked me through and a number of key staff rushed to the hospital, who moments before were enjoying their Sunday off. They established that I had Necrotising Fasciitis, known as the aposflesh eating diseaseapos.  This was further complicated as they then found I also had a rare form of Leukaemia. I was rushed to surgery and operated on immediately, as the leg had to be removed at the hip to prevent the disease from spreading. Richard fell unconscious in the hospitalaposs intensive care unit. My body was riddled with sepsis and the prognosis was poor. Discussions were had between the medical teams to determine which additional limbs may have to be amputated, he said Thankfully for me each time the surgeon was called back to amputate he diagnosed that the issues with my limbs were not the same as my lost leg, so my right leg and arms remain.    After two weeks I started to come around. I was fed through a nasal tube and had a ventilating tube down my throat but slowly over that week I started to improve - so much so that after a week I was hoisted out of bed into a wheelchair to greet my daughter who had her Prom that day. Richard then developed a massive brain swell and stroke and his condition began to deteriorate. He said: I was induced into another coma for a week.  The prognosis was so bad that my family were told there was no way back and spent the next day saying their goodbyes. But, by some amazing miracle, I survived. I woke to my we explaining to me that I had been asleep for a further week. With a tracheostomy in my throat I couldn’t yet speak but slowly from this point I started to improve. Recovering from intensive care is very slow for everyone.  I was told it takes a week to recover for every day spent in ICU and with luck I would be out for Christmas . I had lost all my muscle strength and couldn’t turn my head from left to right and as my strength slowly started toI realised I had lost the use of my arm due to the stroke. Richard says that, despite everything, he concedes that there were some benefits. He said: All this paints a very depressing picture but this was not a sad time, in fact I was rejoicing in being alive. The nurses at ICU even arranged for me to watch a bit of the World Cup on the TV. As I started to recover I was moved to another ward and my physio started to increase and eventually, while explaining to visiting ICU nurses that I still couldn’t move my left arm, I lted it in front of them, astonishing us all. Quickly I recovered and could be moved in a wheel chair. X-rays showed that I could still not swallow anything but water for an indeterminate time.” Richard left North Devon District Hospital on August , much to the astonishment of those involved in his recovery Richard said: “I had a four-week physio plan written for me to help me get to the loo which was achieved in a day. I was walking on crutches within a week and completed my Chemotherapy treatment at the Seamoor Unit. There was one small sting in the tail as I was ed to hospital with Neutropenic Sepsis due to the Chemotherapy and Leukaemia which lasted a week. On the date of my th wedding anniversary I had another X-ray on my throat  which surprisingly showed everything was fine and from that point I could eat anything - cottage pie was first meal in case you are wondering.” Remarkably, Richard is currently cancer-free and has regained a lot of his mobility. He said: I am able to walk on my crutches and climb the largest sand dunes I can find on Woolacombe beach.

In October  Lee-Ann Shiers, , her partner Liam Timbrell, , their -month-old son Charlie, Lee-Anna’s nephew Bailey Allen, , and her niece Skye, , were all killed in a fire set by Melanie Smith.She is currently serving a le sentence behind bars for murder, reports NorthWalesLive.The smoke-stained property has been boarded up ever since but is now set to be sold.  Smith, who will serve at least  years in prison, started the fire after a row over Ms Shiers’ pushchair which was left in a shared hallway. The court heard that Smith, who was also convicted of threatening to burn another woman’s home, had downed  alcoholic drinks before starting the blaze. The semi-detached property was owned by local firefighter Jay Liptrot, who was among those who tackled the blaze. He told the court that he had given Smith notice to leave the property a month before the fire after she had been drunkenly abusive to Ms Shiers.    In November, , Liptrot was jailed for  months after pleading guilty at Caernarfon Crown Court to failing to take proper safety precautions to prevent the deaths. The court heard that a basic fire door costing £ would have meant it would have taken  minutes before the blaze swept through the upstairs flat. Instead, there was a door made of glass and thin wood which failed to act as a barrier between the communal hallway and the stairs.  Liptrot, , initially faced manslaughter charges, which he denied, and on the second day of his trial he admitted the lesser indictment. The charred three-bedroom property is being sold by Prestatyn agents LL Estate Properties and was expected to be auctioned last night at the University of Bolton Stadium. The guide price is £,. The sale details describe it as being in need of total refurbishment, but an investment opportunity.

While royal mums before her left almost all of the childcare to the staff, she wanted to be involved in their day to day lives. But she still had a team of impressive people helping her along the way, in the form of top nannies, chefs and other professionals. There were a few women in particular who played a huge part in William and Harryaposs upbringings, and they stayed close to the boys years after their employment ended. Barbara Barnes Barbara, known as Babs, looked after William from birth and was very close to the young prince.However Diana is said to have been very jealous of her, and felt threatened by their bon d. Royal expert Katie Nicholl claims William would climb into Barbaraaposs bed every morning before his breakfast. She said: The Princess was persuaded to hire royal nanny Barbara Barnes and took it badly when William ended up adoring her. There was a side of Diana that was rather jealous of the nannies and the relationships that they subsequently struck up with the children.  Diana dismissed Barbara when William was four. Olga Powell Olga joined the family when William was six months old and stayed until he was .  She was  at the time, in contrast to Diana who was just , and she was very strict with the boys, refusing to put up with any sort of trouble. She helped the brothers through their parentsapos orce and during the months following Dianaaposs death.  Even after her retirement Olga stayed close to the family, and was invited to key events including Williamaposs st birthday at Windsor Castle, his passing out at Sandhurst and his wedding. William missed a royal engagement to attend her funeral in October . Jessie Webb Writing for the Mirror after the birth of Prince George, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine Ingrid Seward, said Jessie was the perfect addition to the royal household. She said: When Jessie started working as a nanny to Prince William the Walesaposs marriage was unravelling at a rapid pace. Her predecessor Ruth Wallace had found the atmosphere too dficult and given her notice. Jessie, with her outspoken cockney normality and no-nonsense approach, was the ideal person to bring a bit of cheer into the household, which indeed she did. Charles and Diana were hardly speaking during that summer of  and in the autumn William started at his prep school, Ludgrove, leaving Jessie with only Harry to care for. She was convinced he was too thin and needed feeding up and would fill the nursery fridge with sausages, buns, bacon and doughnuts, making the chefs feel guilty.  Growing boys, she claimed, need meat and potatoes, not pasta and vegetables. Great fun and very outspoken, Jessie had few qualms about telling off Prince Charles when he revved up William and Harry just as she had got them settled for the night. Everyone liked her, especially William, who was at an age when he picked up the strained atmosphere around his parents. When Diana dissolved into tears or had a row with Charles, Jessie like a battleship in full sail would distract William and get him out of earshot. Jessie had firm ideas about how the boys should be treated. They did not always correspond with what they were used to and she had no compunctions about criticising the way the princes were being brought up. After one particularly fraught Christmas at Sandringham she complained to the Highgrove staff about the way Diana had spent most of the time in tears, leaving William and Harry to be thoroughly spoilt by the Queenaposs staff. There they are treated like little princes - here they are treated like ordinary boys, she said. She was, of course, totally right. Tiggy Legge-Bourke Prince Charles hired Tiggy in  after his separation from Diana. The Princess reportedly didnapost get on with her and was jealous of their bond. It was Tiggy whom William asked to attend his Eton speech day rather than his warring parents and the attention they would bring.  She once described William and Harry as my babies and later played a key role in helping them adjust after the death of their mother in . Tiggy was criticised in  while taking the Princes abseiling when -year-old Harry was photographed dangling ft above a dam without a helmet and proper safety line. But the Princesapos devotion to her prevented her from being sacked. She is still very close to both men and her son Tom is Prince Williamaposs godson.

Kym Fisher went down from st lbs to just over  stone, following the foul-mouthed tirade from an angry motorist in March . The mum-of-one was driving home from a shopping trip with her daughter Bea Fisher, four, when a male van driver failed to indicate at a roundabout then almost smashed into them. Kym beeped her horn, only for the man to wind down his window and hurl a burger at her car while spouting vile insults about her weight.    The van driver was later fined in court for the incident.After her fat-shaming road rage encounter and a stark warning from her mum Suzanne Fisher, , to lose weightshe wanted to see Bea grow up, Kym decided enough was enough.The full-time mum swapped gorging on fast food and sausage rolls for healthy home-cooked meals and regular exercise to drop  stone over two years. Kym, of Basingstoke, Hampshire, said: The guy was not indicating on the roundabout so I thought he was going straight over but instead he sped up and nearly went into the side of us. I was really scared that he was going to smash into us. I was worried he was going to smash into the back seat and hit Bea. I beeped the horn and the guy just went absolutely ballistic. He wound down his window and threw a burger at the car and was shouting aposyouaposre a fat c***apos. He started really flaring up and ramming into the side of the car. I was really worried because of Bea. We had to drive in a completely dferent direction to get away from him. We went straight to the police station. It ended up going to court and he got a fine. It all happened so quickly and escalated so quickly. It was bizarre he even had a burger on him. Kym, who has gone from a size  to a sleek size eight, now weighs a healthy st lbs - a weight she hadnapost seen on the scales since she was just . As well as her boosting her self-confidence, Kymaposs impressive weight loss has hugely improved her physical health. At st lbs, Kym had size KK breasts that put a major strain on her back and left the mum in daily agony. Kymaposs bulging waistline also meant she struggled to run around after her daughter without getting tired and out of breath.  But after dropping the excess pounds Kym, who now fits into size H bras, feels aposamazingapos and has the energy to hit the gym six times a week and play with her little girl. Kym said: At my biggest my lower back was awful. I went up to a KK in bras and my back was in agony. When Bea started walking and running around, I couldnapost run after her. I was out of breath all the time. Even getting up off the sofa was a bit of an issue. Things like going to soft play, I physically couldnapost get my bum down things. I couldnapost go down the slide with Bea because my bum was too big. I started to get a bit embarrassed that I couldnapost do things with her because I was out of breath and unfit. My mum was saying aposyou need to be careful. You need to sort it out andyou want to be around to see your daughter grow up then you need to lose weightapos. I needed that push. I started to lose weight from home, getting rid of the takeaways and having everything fresh and home-cooked. Then I joined Slimming World in .  I feel amazing in myself. My confidence has shot up so much. I can run around with Bea and not get out of breath. The other day I had to run my friendaposs kids into school and I loved that I could run in and run out and when I got to the car I wasnapost tired. I couldnapost have done that when I was big, it wouldaposve hurt. And itaposs little things like knowing I can go on a bouncy castle with Bea and Iaposm not going to break it. I still have to remind myself sometimes that Iaposm not that big anymore. I also go to the gym five or six times a week. I do boot camps and I power lt. I absolutely love it. Itaposs not just about the exercise. Everyone at the gym is like a family and they all support each other. Until leaving home aged , Kym weighed st lbs and was a slim size  but living alone she discovered a le of takeaways and binge drinking - and quickly piled on the pounds. Gorging on fast food and enjoying regular nights out on the town, saw Kymaposs weight shoot up to st lbs by the age of . After her mum, who was a size , aposalmost diedapos from weight-related health complications in , Kym tried to turn things around and lost st using meal replacement shakes. But just two years later, former sales worker Kym fell pregnant with her daughter and her eating spun totally out of control. As a mum-to-be, who worked in sales at the time, Kym would visit McDonaldaposs multiple times a day and scoffed so many pickle sausage rolls her colleagues would aposcurse herapos for the awful smell. When Bea was born in , Kymaposs weight had reached a staggering st lbs. Kym said: When I left home and moved out, I discovered the le of takeaways and drinking and not having to worry about anything. I gained a lot of weight. But when I was , my mum got sick. Basically she got gallstones. Thataposs all it was but due to her weight, her gallstone got stuck in a tube going to her pancreas and her organs started to fail. She ended up on le support at one point. My mum was a size  at the time and sheaposd already lost st. The doctor told her thatshe hadnapost lost that extra weight, she wouldnapost have made it through the first night. It was a shock that something thataposs not a massive issue really is for someone that has an unfit body. I had never realised that gallstones could be le-threatening. I did the milkshake diet and I lost st but the diet didnapost teach me how to eat properly. And when I got pregnant, my eating spiralled out of control. I ate so much it was unreal and I was eating anything and everything.  Basically I would live at McDonaldaposs. Thereaposs a drive thru two minutes from my house so Iaposd stop for a McDonaldaposs breakfast then again on the way home from work. I had about one or two pigs in blanket toasties from Costa everyday and I got addicted to Branston pickle sausage rolls. I ate so many everyday at work that my co-workers were cursing me because they stank. I didnapost even try to excuse my eating to be honest. I just didnapost care. I wasnapost worried about it and nobody said anything. I had been big for so long and all my friends accepted me for me so nobody ever told me I needed to rein it in or stop eating so much. I was happy. While she may have been aposhappyapos indulging in fast food and baked treats, now there is nothing more rewarding for Kym than seeing how her healthier choices are influencing Bea. Kym said: I absolutely love being a better role model for Bea. She always tells me she canapost wait to go to boot camp with me when sheaposs an adult. She has come to the gym with me and she has just sat there in awe of everyone. And I think itaposs so important to get your kids involved in the kitchen so they can see what goes in our food and know how to make healthy choices. Obviously when sheaposs older, she might do what I did and have loads of takeaways and I canapost stop her but at least I know she has got that knowledge of how to eat and when to eat. She will still have the odd dinner where itaposs chicken nuggets but she knows it is a treat day. And she will actually choose fruit over chocolate. She loves her fruit and vegetables. Iaposm really proud of her.

Speaking in the garden at his London home, being held by eldest son David, , Matthew Linsey spoke about the shock and horror of losing Daniel, , and Amelie, . The teenagers tried to flee after the first explosion at the five-star hotel but a second blast designed to target survivors killed them both.    He said: My children were so nice – they actually went down to the buffet and filled up my plate. Then I wanted more to drink. I was going to get it, my daughter said, aposNo, Iaposll get itapos – and then the bomb went off and they both were running toward me, and Iaposm not sure whether thataposs what killed them or not. I knew thereaposd be another bomb because there always is. He said he wanted to escape as fast as possible with his children but the three of them fled straight into the second blast, and added: Maybe I should have just stayed and covered them with my body.    The heartbroken dad tried desperately to revive Daniel before helping to carry him to an ambulance. Both Daniel and Amelie were unconscious. He said: My daughter seemed to be moving, my son wasnapost. A woman offered to take my daughter downstairs to the ambulance – I needed help moving my son. Someone helped me move him down the stairs and they both ended up in the same hospital. He added: I lost track of my daughter in the confusion. I went with my son. I yelled and screamed for them to help him. The doctors did try, but the equipment was rudimentary.    Mr Linsey has since flown home to be with his two sons and we who were not on the holiday.

Sailing vessels have been referred to as female and given feminine names for centuries. But officials at the Scottish Maritime Museum are introducing a gender neutral interpretation of ships. Director David Mann said the museum, in Irvine, North Ayrshire, has been forced into the move by vandals. The words apossheapos and aposherapos on a sign explaining the history of one of the museums vessels were scratched out by an offended vandal last week.    Mr Mann said it is the second time this year vandals have targeted the very expensive signs. He said they are now looking to phase in the use of new gender neutral signs adding that they aposrecognise the changes in societyapos. Mr Mann said: The Scottish Maritime Museum is a charity, which works hard to preserve our countryaposs maritime heritage for everyone to enjoy. For the second time this year, the museum has been targeted by a vandal, who has destroyed one of the interpretation signs which follow the universally adopted and centuries old maritime tradition of referring to vessels as female.    Like other maritime museums and institutions, we recognise the changes in society and are committed to introducing gender neutral interpretation. As a small charity, however, we are doing this in a phased way so that we are not taking our limited funds away from important preservation activity, introducing gender neutral signs when new interpretation is required. The museum holds an important nationally recognised collection of historic vessels, artefacts and the largest collection of shipbuilding tools and machinery in the country Last week the museum took to social media saying: Second time in a year our signs referring to vessels as she her have been vandalised. We are a charity and our signs are very expensive.    We canapost afford to replace all signs but new signs are gender neutral. Get in touch, we would love to discuss it. Outraged social media users commented on the post saying political correctness had gone too far. One said: People are so ignorant, they want to be respected but donapost respect in . This isnapost how it works you donapost get to erase history and like it or not ships have always been referred to as she.    Another said: Political correctness is getting out of hand, the few are trying to bully the majority, there is room in this world for everyone. This damage does not do there cause any good at all.

Serving as a former hotel and spa, the unnamed location in East Anglia, lies near perfectly-preserved and re with homages to royalty. Salesmen Matt Nadin, , and Andy Thompson, , of South Yorkshire, were left speechless by the spot which remains regally decorated in golden gilded doors and chandeliers. Painted prints of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Princess Kate and more, lie alongside luxurious red sofas and an expensive-looking clash of gold with black décor. The site was a location for the  Bond film featuring Sean Connery in his last portrayal as the infamous agent.  Bond is discharged from British Intelligence after making a mistake during routine training – until terrorist group SPECTRE steal nuclear missiles and he’s reinstated believed to be the only agent fit to beat them. The urban explorers film key areas used in the film from where Bond is resting and recovering to a fight scene and areas he walked through. This comes alongside the especially elegant room number , kitted-out with a spa and views overlooking the stone courtyard before the luscious country landscapes. Atop of the building is a tall spire boasting -degree views unveiling green forests and expansive fields. Matt said: “The location was immaculate, left exactly as it would have been when the guests stayed here.“We had read that one day the hotel just shut its doors with no real explanation and you can see nothing had been removed. “Books in the library, pictures on the walls, the place was any urban explorers dream full of original features, history and a film set to complete the amazing location! “It’s fantastic, the lower rooms feature heavily in the film and we have both watched back film to spot the rooms we were in. “It can be seen in the bit where Bond is resting and recovering, where the fight scene is and at the beginning as we walk through where the art work and chandeliers are. “We just looked at each other speechless which is absolutely not like us.  “We felt fear like you do in any of these huge mansions and places with security but also disbelief at what we had walked into. “I had my usual rush of excitement climbing the roof which is his favourite part of any explore we do. “We go to these places to document them before they are changed and lost forever and love showing people what they may walk passed every day and not even realise are there.” Matt and Andy filmed the location for their YouTube channel Finders Beepers History Seekers .

But the frugal billionaireaposs mean streak was evident long before the famous kidnapping, which has been turned into both a film and a TV series.  The oil magnate’s love of money over family extended to his terminally ill son. Timmy’s tale is perhaps the truest reflection of Getty’s frugality. He was the son of Getty’s fth and final we Teddy Getty Gaston, who died last April aged . In her memoir, the American singer revealed the extent of Getty’s tight pockets. The American-born ­industrialist moaned about having to foot Timmy’s medical bills when he went blind from a brain tumour. While Timmy battled for his le, Getty failed to see him for four years.  The miser missed his son’s birth and, when Timmy died at the age of , Getty did not attend the funeral – sending Teddy a note apologising for being busy. Timmy idolised his father, however. In her book, Alone Together, Teddy remembers Timmy’s love for his father during his dying days in heart-breaking detail. “He was full of love for his dad,” she writes. “ He never knew he was the richest man in the world. He’d heard it but he’d say, ‘That’s what the world sees. I see him as my own darling daddy, whom I love’. How he missed Paul.” She adds: “Sometimes I sat ­quietly beside him while he seemed to be ­thinking and he’d suddenly say, ‘When will he come home  I wish I had a daddy like other boys have. Do you think he really loves me  I wish I could talk to him.’  “‘Well, let’s talk to him,’ I’d say, and we’d call Paul. He’d tell everyone then for days that he’d spoken to his father. He never asked for any material things, all he wanted was to see his dad. He never begrudged the fact that Paul never came. He was too loving… and yet in his heart he needed a father.” So Getty was as absent as he was parsimonious. Teddy never forgave him for failing toto his American home from England during Timmy’s illness, citing it as the reason for their orce in .  In letters sent in the years leading up to Timmy’s death, Teddy pleaded with her husband toand comfort their son. But he never did. Teddy wrote to Getty in : “I know now that you aren’t coming home to us, because I know you don’t want to, and so I have come to the tragic realisation that you have no real concern for Tim or me.” At that time, in , Getty was ­negotiating the groundbreaking deal to secure oil rights in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which would see him become America’s first billionaire. But not only did Getty refuse tohome – he cruelly built up  hope in his little boy’s mind. He regularly promised to visit Timmy in New York hospitals after his ­operations, but again never did so.  The Getty Oil boss was even heartless enough to complain about doctors’ bills on the phone to Teddy as Timmy lay screaming in pain in the room next door. Teddy remembers bursting into tears and hanging up the call, feeling alone and afraid as she battled the toughest years of her le without her husband. “Timmy needed his father,” she says in her memoir. “I needed him, too. In the days after Timmy’s initial brain tumour diagnosis aged six in , many members of the family, including Teddy’s brother Ware, nephews, nieces and Timmy, excitedly gathered to wait for Getty as the Queen Mary liner pulled into New York, told by the tycoon that he would be on board. But a message from the captain confirmed he had never fulfilled his promise of travelling across the Atlantic. Getty had not only failed to board the ship – he had not even bothered to let his family know.  Two days later, Timmy had to undergo one of his countless operations, hopes dashed of having daddy by his side. Later that year Getty wrote a letter from the Ritz Hotel in Paris which would be callous from a pauper, but was positively cruel from a billionaire. He said: “I hope Timmy can keep away from doctors, except for a  visit. I don’t think doctors can do much for him now, except for a check-up, and that shouldn’t be more than  unless the doctors charge on the ability to pay and not on a tarf and I avoid such doctors.” He told Teddy the money she paid for a pony to comfort Timmy must come out of her own purse.  Teddy died when he was just -years-old. But it was the abduction of his -year-old grandson, John Paul Getty III, that showed the world just what a miser J Paul really was. The free spirited -year-old was living in Rome with his father, J. Paul Getty II when he was kidnapped. He had apparently been trying to woo a Belgian go-go dancer in the Piazza Navona in Rome when he disappeared before dawn on July , . Paul was buying a comic book at a newsstand when he was abducted by three men who knocked him out by hitting him with a gun.  The men drove him to a cave in the southern part of the country and tied him up while they probed the Getty family for the hefty ransom which shockingly his grandfather refused to pay. No-one knows exactly the sequence of events but a ransom note read: Dear Mother: I have fallen into the hands of kidnapers. Don’t let me be killed! Make sure that the police do not interfere. You must absolutely not take this as a joke… Don’t give publicity to my kidnaping.” At first police didnapost believe the boy had been kidnapped but they realised it was no joke when the kidnappers called to say they would send the boyaposs mother one of her sonaposs fingers and demanded million from his grandfather.  Initially J Paul Getty reportedly refused to pay - commenting that he had  other grandchildren. He was quoted as saying that he opposed paying the kidnappers in principle, because it only encourages kidnapping as a criminal practice. The billionaire is reported to have said: “I have  other grandchildren andI pay one penny now, then I’ll have  kidnapped grandchildren.” His refusal to pay lead to devastating consequences for the teenager. John Paul was subjected to months of agonising torture and even had part of his ear cut off, which was then sent to a local paper. In early November an envelope was delivered to the Rome daily Il Messaggero,Rolling Stone reports .It contained a lock of reddish hair and a severed human ear.This is Paul’s first ear, read a typewritten note. If within ten days the family still believes that this is a joke mounted by him, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits.apos The delivery of the ear was apparently enough for Getty Snr to agree to pay the ransom - but at a reduced rate of millionAt the time he was estimated to be worth around £bn.  But this wasnapost an act of grandfatherly compasion, J.Paul was told the ransom would be tax deductable by his accounts. Paul was finally released five months after he was first abducted. He flagged down a truck driver, who drove him to the nearest police station where officers noticed his missing ear. Following his ordeal, Paul developed an addiction to alcohol. And nine years after his released was left quadriplegic following an overdose of methadone and valium. He died, aged , in .

Kayla Pratt, , first met future fiancé, Robert Longo Jr, , in March  when she was asked by her mother to drop him back home after a friendly get together at her house. Despite neither of them looking for an age gap relationship, the pair found themselves falling in love as the drop-offs became more frequent. After just five weeks of dating Robert proposed to Kayla. Now the couple are set to be married exactly one-year later on August , .    Family and friends have expressed their disapproval of the relationship dubbing Robert a paedophile and suggesting Kayla is not a real woman. Despite the criticism the couple are excited for their future le with one another, having hatched plans to buy a house and have children together. Kayla, from Humboldt County, Calornia, US, said: We met through my mother because I would drive him home from the family house after heaposd visit so he wouldnapost have to walk two miles. At first, we were just friends and liked the fact we were both very non-judgemental - we werenapost even looking for a relationship at this time. But after time we started falling for each other and, when he took me out for my th birthday in July, we decided to give dating a go.    It was a whirlwind from there and we quickly got engaged five weeks later, but I wouldnapost change it for the world. We want people to know that loving someone means so much more than just a number. Since starting their relationship, the pair claim that they regularly encounter rude comments from strangers, friends and family. Kayla, who is currently looking for work, explained: We have received a lot of rude comments, mostly from my family and a few other people. Robert has been called a paedophile and someone told him that I wasnapost aposwoman enoughapos for him.    We have been told our relationship is morally wrong and that there had to be something wrong with him for him to want to be with me. Some people are really supportive, some arenapost supportive at all and some people are indferent to it. Robert has children who are  and , so older than me, and they are trying to come to terms with our relationship. I have a one-year-old daughter and Robert has acted as her father her whole le, so she doesnapost think anything of it.    While Robertaposs own children are not completely comfortable with their relationship, the couple plan on having children of their own in the future. Kayla continued: Despite raising my daughter as our child, we plan on having a few more children together biologically. Once we get married in August this year, we are going to move into our own house together and then think about the future in terms of kids. Although other people have negative opinions on our relationship, we are happy and donapost want anyone to jeopardise that. We are both of legal age and in love, so we believe thereaposs nothing wrong with that.

In that moment, Doctor Eduardo Oliva was attending me, in Constitucion, in the central Chilean region of Maule. They are the same, the same details, everything, the other baby was dated six years ago and my daughter is one year and  months old.” Ms Aguilera contacted some relatives to tell them about the situation and they found another mother had been given what looked like the same ultrasound scan seven years ago.    She wrote: “I am totally outraged, being able to play like this with the feelings of a person, deluding families and how could have been giving scans that are private to other people. I do not want to imagine how the mum of this baby will be when she finds out that it was shared with many people.” Her post was shared over , times and other users posted photos of the same scan which they said they had received in recent years. Local media report the scan could cost families in Chile around , Pesos - around £. Izkia Siches, the president of the Doctors College, said that the case is “very serious”it is confirmed. Doctor Oliva has released a statement confirming the women’s suspicions, blaming a technical problem for having given the expectant mothers the same scan.    He said: “The procedure done to every patient belongs to D scans whose main goal is to make an intrauterine analysis and diagnosis in case of an eventual medical situation. The exam was informed based on a set of D pictures which was given to every mother. This medical act was done properly in each of the cases seen in the post.” Dr Oliva claims the necessary scans were carried out correctly on all the expectant mothers and the printed D scan has “no medical value”. He also explained why he gave the same picture to all the mothers saying that “unintentionally in the moment of printing the D picture, this picture was a preset picture on the printer as a demonstration. He said that as the image was a demonstration picture from the printer it did not represent him “cheating” the mothers and he said “no additional payments were asked for for the D ultrasound scans. He apologised and said he empathised with the “disappointment and bother of the mothers and fathers”.

While the cause of the fire is still considered accidental, any proof that a discarded cigarette butt led to the fire could result in a prison sentence.    A criminal enquiry has been on going since April  – the day the fire started in the medieval cathedral’s roof. The main suspects are the renovators working for Le Bras Freres– a company based in eastern France which has had won a contract to restore the spire. It was lost in the blaze, along with most of the roof, although the Bras workers have insisted they were not on site when it started. Company spokesman Marc Eskenazi said: Yes, there are some people who, from time to time, have ignored the ban and we regret this.    Mr Estenazi added: Under no circumstances can a poorly extinguished butt be the cause of the Notre Dame fire. In fact, investigators have made it clear that the fire could have started at least a full day before emergency services knew about it. Forensics experts have told those leading the criminal enquiry that a discarded cigarette could have started carbonising tinder-dry wood without anyone noticing.    This is very common in the old buildings around central Paris,’ said a source close to the enquiry. There would not have been much energy in the fire to begin with, and certainly not enough to trigger alarms. This would have changed as the combustion intensied and sparked a full blown fire on the roof of the building. In a further twist, it has emerged that Le Bras Brothers were involved in another site fire earlier this month. On April , a blaze broke at a listed building being used as a youth centre in Belleville-sur-Meuse, in eastern France.    The damage was minor, and the fire was easily brought under control by firefighters, but Le Bras restorers were once again implicated, and interviewed by police. The Paris investigating source said: The company has accepted responsibility for the fire in Belleville, but not the one in Paris. What happened in Belleville is obviously of signicance to the enquiry in Paris. Le Bras Freres last year finished a widespread restoration programme of Reims Cathedral in eastern France. It had won the contract to restore the Notre Dame spire that was designed by the architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc and erected in .  They were due to be on site for up to four years along with Europe Scaffolding, another company which had just put  tons of scaffolding around Notre Dame, along with a lt that could move up and down the ft fire. Notre Dame has been closed for the foreseeable future, but a trust fund has already raised more than a billion euros for its restoration. French president Emmanuel Macron has pledged that it will reopen ‘within five years’ and that it will be ‘more beautul’ than before.

Matthew Linsey and Ben Nicholson met at a hospital while looking for their British children after two suicide bombers targeted the Shangri-La hotel in the capital Colombo. Mr Nicholsonaposs we Anita, , son Alex,  and daughter Annabel, , were killed in the first explosion as they ate breakfast at the Table One restaurant. Mr Linsey and his children - Daniel, , and Amelie,  - ran out of the room but the siblings died after a second blast aimed at killing survivors trying to flee.    Mr Linsey, , has previously told how he was forced to make the heart-wrenching decision over which injured child to save. He believed Amelie was less seriously injured and went to hospital with Daniel as his daughter remained with another survivor. Daniel was pronounced dead and Mr Linsey, a US-born investment banker, later found out that Amelie had died as well. At the hospital, Mr Linsey, from London, encountered British lawyer Mr Nicholson, , whose family was based in Singapore.    Devastated Mr Linsey, whose children were dual UK-US citizens, told the Daily Mail: We hugged and tried to support each other. We helped each other. He said he is still in touch with Mr Nicholson, adding: He is a lovely man. I spoke to him [Tuesday]. He is still there trying to organise the repatriation of his family. In an interview with CNN, the father, whose face is scarred from shrapnel, said Daniel and Amelie had gone down to breakfast buffet before him and filled up his plate. Shortly after he joined them the first blast went off.  As his eldest son David, , held him outside their London home, Mr Linsey said: I wanted more to drink. I was going to get it, my daughter said, aposNo, Iaposll get itapos – and then the bomb went off and they both were running toward me, and Iaposm not sure whether thataposs what killed them or not. I knew thereaposd be another bomb because there always is. The Linseys tried to escape but they were hit by the second blast near lts on the hotelaposs third floor. Mr Linsey has been left tormented by what,anything, he could have done dferently to protect his teenage children. He said: Maybe I should have just stayed and covered them with my body.  The trio had gone on an Easter holiday together while Mr Linseyaposs we and two other children stayed home. Mr Linsey said a woman who survived the blast offered to take Amelie downstairs to an ambulance while he carried Daniel. Both of his children were unconscious. He travelled with Daniel, a student at Westminster Kingsway College in central London, in an ambulance, and at the hospital he tried to revive his son by massaging his heart. Mr Linsey then went looking for Amelie, a pupil at Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith, west London, and found her body under a hospital sheet. A doctor helped the grief-stricken father reach the US Embassy, and he flew home to London later Sunday amid fears of more attacks on the island.   Eight British nationals were killed in the attacks since claimed by ISIS. In the aftermath, Mr Nicholson paid tribute to his we Anita, a lawyer, and their children. The family lived in Singapore and were on holiday in Sri Lanka. He said: Mercully, all three of them died instantly and with no pain or suffering. I am deeply distressed at the loss of my we and children. Anita was a wonderful, perfect we and a brilliant, loving and inspirational mother to our two wonderful children. The holiday we had just enjoyed was a testament to Anitaaposs enjoyment of travel and providing a rich and colourful le for our family, and especially our children. Alex and Annabel were the most amazing, intelligent, talented and thoughtful children and Anita and I were immensely proud of them both and looking forward to seeing them develop into adulthood.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"strathlachlan cup attracts players from all over argyll","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe annual Strathlachlan Cup Open Pairs indoor bowling competition took place on Saturday February  at Strachur Memorial Hall.There was a good turnout of  pairs with members from Cairnbaan, Colintraive, Connel, Innellan, Inveraray, Kilmun as well as the host club  Strathlachlan.There were some close games in the qualying rounds and the lucky four pairs to reach the semi-finals were Tom Paton and Moira Robertson, Strathlachlan Myra Campbell and Duncan Lauder, Innellan Fulton Ronald, Connel, and Robert Scott, Cairnbaan, and John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs Senior, Strathlachlan.The finalists were Strathlachlan#s John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs v Fulton Ronald and Robert Scott, with the visiting team going into the last end one shot up.

Gordon Law took the best spur of the day measuring an impressive cms.There were a few decent whiting around too and a surprising number of dogfish.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"canoodling teens blight playpark kids","story":"NewsCanoodling teens blight playpark for kidsAnger at the Ayr seafront beackparkShareByEdwin Lawrence:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsTeen frolics on the chute - crime prevention boss Alec Kelly hits out \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTeenagers fooling around at a playpark spoiled the fun for younger kids. An alarmed grandfather heard his nine-year-old grandson shout for help at the Ayr seafront playpark. The wee boy had gone for a shot on the £, tower complex, which has several chutes. But canoodling teens made the youngster climb over a ledge to get past them. And then they pushed him down the chute, prompting his cry for help. Grandfather Alex Kelly, who is chairman of South Ayrshire Crime Prevention Panel, said: “It was Saturday night about  o’clock and we had been for chips in Ayr. “My grandson wanted to go down to the seafront for a shot on the new tower. “I thought I would just stay in the car and let him go ahead but I could see there were a few teenagers, aged  or , hanging about. “My grandson was off and running and away up the inside of the tower. “The next thing I knew he was shouting for help at the bottom of a chute.” Alex added: “He told me what had happened and I wasn’t too happy. “I also saw a dad take his wee girl from inside the tower as she was intimidated by the older kids on it. “I didn’t want to confront the teenagers but I did phone the council. I don’t think it’s acceptable to let teenagers intimidate children in these circumstances. “There should be some kind of supervision that doesn’t involve the police, although the council seems to think the police should be involved.” Alex, of Maybole, reckons there were six young teenagers at the top of the tower, three boys and three girls. He said: “In the good old days we had park keepers to deal with this kind of thing.” A council spokesman said: We are happy that our play parks are popular, but anyone using them should act responsibly. There are plenty of places for parents, s and carers to supervise their children in the play park.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"dynamite plan give ayr great","story":"NewsDynamite plan to give Ayr a great futureAll sorts of buildings such as Matalan, Odeon and Waterfront pub would come downShareByStephen Houston:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsBack in use - the old rail bridge would become an inner ring road \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA radical plan to rescue Ayr town centre has been published – and it’s sure to provoke astonishment. That’s exactly what the creators of the Bruce Plan want in a bid to stimulate a real future for the stricken town. The #AyrDeservesBetter campaign want people to sign up to the cause for real action. And Rob Close, chief writer of the -page document, said: “We want real action not yet another expensive consultant’s report. “We have written this for free – now we want our elected leaders to actually do something.” The details of the Bruce Plan – named after King Robert who routed English troops from Ayr – can only now be revealed. The controversial idea, devised by Rob, a Mastermind contestant and Radio  Brain of Britain finalist, involves flattening buildings throughout the centre. And that includes working businesses: ● Matalan ● Mr Basrai’s World Cuisines ● The Odeon ● Sports Direct ● The Tam o’Shanter petrol station ● The Waterfront bar restaurant Wrecking balls will also be brought in to demolish the old Orient cinema Babylon nightclub. This is a key part of the new inner ring road which would utilise the old rail bridge over the River Ayr and replace a traffic system regarded as bonkers. The railway station would finally be annexed from the old hotel and built several hundred yards south at the old Townhead yard. The group see this as “critical” to the future of Ayr. It is thought Network Rail would favour this as certain s at present cannot take the extra long trains now required on the route. The bus station would be relocated to the Matalan Sports Direct site.And the Stagecoach bus station would become part of a new culturalquarter.Rob Close, an historian and architectural author, is working closely with architect Pat Lorimer, the spokesman for #AyrDeservesBetter. Rob said: “I appreciate some may disagree and that I have made no attempt to cost it. “But the cost of doing nothing and allowing the town to crumble in the face of unrelated decisions by successive South Ayrshire Council administrations is much more of a risk – financially, socially and aesthetically. “I feel this plan begins to look like a town that many more of us will want to live in. “People can have a go at itthey wish, but at least it gives us something to focus minds on.” The -strong #AyrDeservesBetter are a think-tank of Ayr partisans. Miller Road and Fort Street would become part of the inner ring road, with the historic Sandgate largely access only. This ring would slice through the Orient cinema site, cut through the Aldi car park, the Waterside bar and into Fort Street. Seven piers of the old fishmarket railway bridge still exist and could provide the support for a new structure The Bruce Plan has drawn ideas from a  map of the town centre. Unlike some towns there are physical constraints such as the river, bridges and railway line that cannot be moved.The #ADB advocates the entire bottomend of the High Street no longer beinga shopping area, and all businessesclustered from the centre towards the top of the town, anchored by the Ayr CentralMall.Businesses in Miller Road including LA Bowl would be encouraged to relocate to the central core and for it to become largely residential again. South Ayrshire Council has already advocated demolishing the Citadel pool and sports hall and creating a new one at the Kyle Centre. The group proposes the Station Hotel becomes council offices and the railway buildings on the other side of the track to become social enterprises. #AyrDeservesBetter say the town centre developed piecemeal over the past  years without an overal plan. With  empty shops and buildings there is now need to have compression rather than an expansive retail area.Matalan or even Marks  Spencercould become tenants in the Hourstons building.Details of the Bruce Plan also call for no methadone prescriptions in the town centre. A free bus would operate to include the river and seafront and parking for the first three hours would be free. Extra parking could be created on the old Afflecks factory via Sandgate. It is mooted a public competition to re-design Burns Statue Square after the Odeon and Burns House are brought down. A cultural quarter of town would include the Gaiety Theatre, Mecca Bingo, the nightclubs of Arthur Street and the Mercure Hotel. The Plan states: “Some of the ideas for rescuing Ayr could be re-located here, such as LA Bowl and Fury’s from Nile Court.” Rob hopes the ideas can gain traction and adds: “I know such a scheme will come to fruition onlythe council, and our national governments, show the will and find the money.” And Pat Lorimer acknowledges it might be pie in the sky, but said: “It is very important pie in the sky. “At the moment people are twiddling their thumbs and thinking about putting a traffic island here or there. “This is radical.” To get behind the new movement email info@ayrdeservesbetter.org.uk.

It is feared either below par casting or a low quality bronze may be causing problems for Icarus. For the past  years the bronze sculpture has adorned the entrance to the Scottish International Aerospace Park at Prestwick. Thousands of drivers pass him every day - and some think he’s a double for former Celtic striker John Hartson. It was commissioned by the now defunct Enterprise Ayrshire and created by the firm where Kelpies sculptor Andy Scott was lead designer. An expert who brought his fears for the sculpture to the Ayrshire Post said: “This should not be happening and my eye can also see cracks that have obviously had some filler work done. “This should not be happening. Good bronze should last without issues for generations. I just wonderon a cost basis the foundry used low quality bronze.” Untrained eyes can see rust developing on the back of Icarus’s wings and on the globe he stands on. Between his feet the surface seems dimpled and stained. One theory is it could be bronze disease, similar to what rust is on iron-based material. The matrix of copper and tin that forms bronze is attacked by hydrochloric acid which can combine with chloride in sea water. On most days Icarus is hit by salty moist air from the sea just half a mile away. In Greek mythology Icarus flew too close to the sun and his wax wings melted. He fell into the sea and drowned. An academic at Brown University at Rhode Island said: “If left untreated, bronze disease will continue to eat away at the metal to the point of complete destruction of the artact.” A study into the condition of Icarus is now to take place. A spokeswoman for Scottish Enterprise said: “The statue at Prestwick Airport was commissioned some  years ago by the local enterprise company, Enterprise Ayrshire. “We have instructed an inspection of the statue and remedial work will be undertakenrequired.” Icarus sculptor Andy Scott now lives in the US and was keen to look at images of him. He said: “Icarus was sculpted by my former company Scott Associates Sculpture  Design and I was lead sculptor. “It was cast in bronze by Beltane Studios in Peebles. It was based, I remember, on a design drawn by a local school pupil. I’ve not personally seen the sculpture for some time. Last time I did it looked just fine. Bronze does not rust. It patinates with time, and the color does alter in the environment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnJohn HartsonPrestwick AirportUniversities and CollegesEducationAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"new 40m leisure centre ayr","story":"NewsA new £m leisure centre for Ayr High Street will open in Arran Mall is earmarked for flagship facilityShareBySarah Hilley:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsCitadel Leisure Centre Ayr\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new £ million leisure centre for Ayr High Street is due to open in  the council has revealed.

A project co-ordinator will be hired to oversee the ambitious venture at a cost of £, for four years. A report on the plan said: The creation of a leisure hub would increase footfall and extend the active hours of this area of the town centre, allowing more nightle to thrive and more community activities to take place. A design brief will start within the next few months and engagement with stakeholders is about to kick off. South Ayrshire Council estimate the design and construction of the Citadel replacement would take three years. Public-private partnership Hub South West Scotland are to be appointed to create a business case for the leisure centre. It is one part of the councilaposs town centre strategy and action plan, which was given the green light by Leadership Panel councillors this week. The vision is for the High Street to be ided into four zones: culture and heritage, leisure and recreation, retail and Burns Statue Square. South Ayrshire Councillor Brian McGinley said: It is a good report and a long time coming. A consultation on the town centre saw , people fill in an online survey.

That’s because Joe, who has died aged , was a one-man citizens’ advice bureau. Joe was incredibly well-versed on how local government works. And he knew the right people to contact in a range of agencies, including South Ayrshire Council. In recent years, Joe was best known as chairman of Riverside Tenants and Residents Association. But he was equally weel kent in the Lochside and Wallacetoun areas - working passionately to improve the housing stock. Joe seemed to be involved in everything pertaining to housing and community issues. He worked alongside Shelter, learning about legislation on homelessness. He also had close links with Riverside Evangelical Church and the Salvation Army - respecting the wonderful work they do in the community. Joe was also involved with the John Pollock Centre, the Mainholm Advice Centre and was on the Community Planning Board. He was a member of the late lamented Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forumwhich provided a focal point for five communities in Ayr. Joe Lafferty hailed from Newarthill, Lanarkshire, and was a choirboy in his youth. He loved singing right up to his untimely death, being a member of the Ayrways Choir, which helps people with breathing dficulties. In his late teenage years and throughout his s, Joe worked abroad for much of the time. He was a project manager on building sites in countries including Nigeria and Pakistan. Joe ed to Scotland after his marriage to Jean, and became aware of the need for communities to have a voice. This became the driving force in the second half of his le. David Burns, South Ayrshire Council’s former head of housing, said he was sorry to hear of Joe’s passing. Mr Burns added: “He was a wonderful gentleman, always taking a keen interest wherever he felt there was a benefit for the community orhe felt ideas would have a detrimental impact on people. “He also made sure I kept my feet on the ground and often said, ‘Don’t change your ability to listen to the community boy, and you’ll do just rightly.” Joe was highly thought of by many senior SAC managers, and often engaged in banter with them, to make his point. Colleague and friend Pauline Mackie said of Joe: other. “He was never a man who shied away from his own past mistakes and was always very courteous and generous about others as well. He was never a man to bare a grudge. “His wisdom and knowledge along with his sense of humour made him legendary . People were drawn to him even though it meant not getting much of a word in once he got started. He was always courteous and never lost his sense of humour. “Joe also believed in sharing the knowledge he had gleaned over  years, believing knowledge would empower people and communities.” Pauline added: “ Joe, myself and Jackie Lennon considered ourselves the Three Musketeers in the Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forum. “I believe we did make a dference to a lot of people, but sadly the project came to an end.” Joe’s funeral service will be held at noon at Masonhill Crematorium on April  - which would have been his st birthday. He is survived by Jean and their sons, Jack and Jamie, of whom he was immensely proud, and who, like their dad, have worked abroad.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14564550.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18934953.jpg","title":"partick thistle chairman shares tweet","story":"NewsPartick Thistle chairman shares tweet showing injured wrist after celebrating Jags win against Ayr UnitedJacqui Low led from the front as Partick gained a massive win in their battle to beat the drop.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsJacqui shows off her injured hand, left, and chats to boss Gary Caldwell before last nights clash\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football chairman took one for the team last night - after injuring herself celebrating a vital three points.

Wellswood - named after the old water well and the cover of mature trees including chestnut - takes pride of position opposite the Ayr cricket oval in Alloway. It nestles back from the road and has the unique feature of a horseshoe driveway that also comes out to Cambusdoon Drive. You get nearly  square feet all on the one level of eight principle apartments. Given Robert Burns grew up a couple of hundred yards away he may well have sipped the water from the well. Top agents Corum have it on their books - but the price is “on application.” Neighbouring homes have sold for £, or more. Corum say: “It would ideally suit the large family or indeed those clients downsizing from a larger property given the facility of all on the level accommodation.” There is broad reception hall, formal lounge, family TV room, large games room with full size snooker table, rear dining room or extra bedroom. A handy office has a window to the rear and there are three double bedrooms, one of which is en-suite. The modern family bathroom has a bath and separate shower. The loft is floored so feasibly there is room to supersize. Outside the mature gardens offer a pleasant mix of soft and hard landscaped areas including extensive lawn with mature trees and borders. The monobloc carriage drive gives access to a double garage with remote control access. And the agents point out the back garden enjoys south westerly sunlight. It has a high degree of privacy and barbeque area ideal for entertaining.

The event involved a successful partnership between South Ayrshire Council, Scottish Rowing, University of West of Scotland and Ayrshire coastal rowing clubs. And it’s believed to be the first time in  years that an organised water-based activity has taken place on the River Ayr. The event was designed to encourage young people to interact safely with the river and get fit and active at the same time. Many of the participants will be undertaking Duke of Edinburgh Gold Awards in the summer and this event was the perfect warm-up. All the young adults were given a safety briefing by representatives from Scottish Rowing, the council and South Ayrshire coastal rowing clubs. They were then allocated their equipment before the group all had the opportunity to try out a single scull, open canoe and a costal boat, setting off along an m course. During the day they all received expert tuition from experienced rowers and instructors. Belmont Academy pupil Alex Crooks, aged , said: “It was something new, a new experience. “I’m doing canoeing for my Duke of Edinburgh award, so it’s about getting experience of the water and the river. I enjoyed it.” Ben Gilmour, aged , a pupil at Prestwick Academy, said: “It was good. “We get out and do free things and it’s good way to spend your time, instead of playing the X-Box! “I do sailing and I do figure skating but I’ve never come out and done loads of watersports . “This has been good and you get to meet new people as well.” It’s hoped that the programme will spark renewed interest in rowing and watersports, given the River Ayr’s proximity to Ayr Academy. Backing the event was the RNLI , who through their Respect the Water campaign, were able to reinforce the key messages about staying safe. The participants were also given a waterproof mobile phone cover, along with literature about water safety, as a thank-you for taking part. Tess Crooks who goes to Belmont Academy said: “It was a fun and enjoyable day, I would like to do more and get to learn new skills on the water.” Ryan Matthews, an apprentice from GE Caledonian, said: “It was a very enjoyable experience and good training for my DofE Gold canoeing expedition later in the summer. “It also made me realise the fitness required for this type of activity and how I need to get fitter.” Councillor William Grant, Children and Young People Portfolio Holder for South Ayrshire Council, said: “South Ayrshire has outstanding natural resources available to everyone. “This is a great way for young people to explore nature, increase their confidence and learn new skills at the same time. “We need to respect all our waterways but rivers should also be enjoyed and the young people taking part clearly had a great time thanks to the expert supervision.” Vincent McWhirter, RNLI Volunteer Community Safety Officer said: “We have  miles of coast line from Barassie to Ballantrae with four main rivers and numerous lochs all of which are very attractive but can also be potentially dangerous, so it was really worthwhile to teach the young people new skills and at the same time learn about the hazards but in a fun way.” If you are interested in taking up rowing, you can contact Scottish Rowing https:www.scottish-rowing.org.uk , Ayrshire Coastal Rowing Clubs: Troon Coastal Rowing https:en-gb.facebook pg TroonCoastalRowingClub posts , Prestwick Coastal Rowing https:www.prestwicksailingclub prestwick-coastal-rowing-club , Carrick Coastal Rowing www.carrickcoastalrowing.org, Girvan Coastal Rowing girvan.rowing@btinternetLike us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"gala-woman-appears-from-custody-to-admit-second-drink-driving-offence","story":"A -year-old woman appeared from custody at Jedburgh Sherf Court and pleaded guilty to driving while almost four and a half times the legal alcohol limit.Tammy Strafford of Bridge Street, Galashiels, admitted driving with a breath alcohol count of  microgrammes - the legal limit being  - on the BClovenfords to Bowland road on Sunday.Sentence was deferred until May  for reports after the court was told she committed a similar offence recently.Strafford has received an interim disqualication until sentence is passed."},{"url":null,"title":"light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-on-borders-railway-claims-boss","story":"SCOTRAILS boss believes the end is in sight to the turmoil on the Borders Railway.Speaking at a public meeting in Galashiels yesterday, Alex Hynes admitted the service has not been good enough.Over the last few months commuters have faced a number of cancellations on the Tweedbank to Edinburgh line due to staff shortages, as drivers are trained to operate new high speed trains.But Mr Hynes said passengers will soon see more carriages and more reliability, as the training courses come to an end.He told the meeting of the Borders Railway Community Partnership: \"The service we have delivered to our customers has fallen well below the level they expect and we take full responsibility for that.\"There are a number of reasons for that, which have been well publicised, but we are focused on working flat out to resolve this train backlog we have had.\"Every single day we are having to make dficult decisions to cancel trains.\"We are training our Edinburgh drivers on the new high speed trains and that will be completed by the end of May.\"From my perspective, my priorities are threefold.\"Number one is we have to improve the service on the Borders Railway.

seeing the right clinician at the right time for their specic needs.The new service, developed in partnership by Riverside, NHS  and ELHSCP, ensured that urgent care was dealt with on the same day and patients should have ldquono anxieties about being seen by the right professional at the right time.Through this new way of delivering patient care, it not only provided an increase in the number of patient appointments with practice GPs and other healthcare professionals, but also provided an increase in appointmentfor patients with complex needs.A recent survey conducted within the practice demonstrated that more than half of patients agreed that they did not always need to see a GP.Work is also under way by ELHSCP to implement a new telephone and IT system that will support call demand into the practice.The importance of patient involvement in getting services right is ldquovery much recognised by the practice, which is encouraging residents to get involved with the Patient

Thankfully no one heard me asking for it but the embarrassment of having to ask was enough to spur me on.ldquoAt this point, on what should have been an exciting time, I was left feeling down, and it was then that I decided that it was time to lose weight.ldquoNever again did I want to be in that position of asking for an extension. The next time I was flying I wanted to be able to buckle up like any other person.ldquoWhen I ed, I decided to join Weight Watchers at Musselburgh Hope Church, and it was the best decision I have ever made.ldquoI have now lost more than four-and-a-half stones and feel fantastic.

My wellness coach, Lisa Stewart, is so supportive, as well as all the other members.ldquoNow I can make the right choices, walk more and shop for clothes that I would never have been able to buy before.

Irsquom so glad I joined with Carole as I find it easy to follow.ldquoI can still eat my favourite snacks ndash crisps ndash which is something I was not prepared to give up. Thankfully I can enjoy these and still lose weight.ldquoDoing the Freestyle plan with Carole is really good although we do not always eat the same foods. The choice of foods that we can enjoy and eat means both us can enjoy what we want.ldquoThe support from the coach Lisa is fantastic and sometimes Irsquom the only male who stays for the weekly talk. This does not phase me as my weight loss is too important and everyone is really friendly. Even when my we canrsquot make it, I go on my own. Men should not be afraid of joining as Irsquove had a fantastic weight loss.ldquoMy food choices are now better and I pay more attention to what I eat. We both used to eat things like large bars of chocolate, deep-pan pizzas, lots of bread and cheese.

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":null,"title":"council-planners-accused-of-having-a-lack-of-knowledge-of-their-own-policy","story":"A planning application to build the three-bedroom home and a detached garage on the outskirts of Camptoun Holdings, a small hamlet two miles north of Haddington, was refused by the local authority for the second time in five years.However, the applicants have now lodged an appeal in which they claim the planning officer who turned them down did not understand the policyused to make that decision.They claim that the house, which would be built on land currently occupied by derelict agricultural buildings, should be classed as an ldquoenabling development because they say it would improve the area.In an appeal which will be heard by the councilrsquos Local Review Body next month, they state: ldquoThe planner, in the pre-application response, did not accept that the proposed development was an enabling development.ldquoHowever, it is submitted that this conclusion only serves to demonstrate the lack of knowledge of the development process.ldquoTo allow for the removal of derelict buildings and reclamation of an unkempt siterequires third-party intervention.ldquoThe applicant is submitting a proposal for a single dwelling house and garage absorbing the costs of demolition and reclamation.ldquoThe development will bring substantial improvements to this rural brownfield land and improve landscape quality as well as visual and residential amenity.East Lothian Council has a planning policy which bars new housing in the countryside unless exceptional circumstances can be established.The plans for a house at Camptoun Holdings were first lodged with the council in .On that occasion they were refused and the Local Review Body rejected an appeal.Agents for the applicants this time around will argue that there has been a change in circumstances at the site, which has deteriorated further over the years.The Local Review Body meets in Haddington on Thursday, May ."},{"url":null,"title":"new-exhibition-highlights-history-of-musselburgh-athletic-fc","story":"The display was officially opened by Billy Brown, a former Hearts and Bradford City manager, who comes from Musselburgh and is a former Musselburgh Athletic manager, at a reception in the Old Town Hall.On show at the High Street museum is a iety of memorabilia relating to lsquoThe Burghrsquo, including trophies, medals, strips, pennants and photographs.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

However, speculation about optimal currency arrangements after independence is, well, precisely that. Scotland has yet to decide that it even wants to be independent, and debating the minutiae of monetary policy is not going to win many converts. Whatever Nicola Sturgeon says today about the new road map to Scottish independence, we know itrsquos not going to happen for some time. Not until the dust has settled on Brexit, at the earliest.That leaves a host of monetary imponderables. What will Scotlandrsquos relationship be to the UK  Will it be broadly confederal, as envisaged in the  Independence White Paper, or totally separate  Will the UK still be in something like a single market with the European Union  Will Scotland have a single market with the UK, or will there be a hard border at Gretna  Will the UK Government make le dficult for an independent Scotland, or might Westminster offer incentives to keep Scotland in the broad UK financial orbit Then therersquos the euro, which was hardly mentioned in last yearrsquos Sustainable Growth Commission Report, the SNPrsquos bible on managed independence. To join the euro requires, in theory at least, the possession of an independent currency. However, the EU would likely be so keen to ease the path of Scotland into the EU that it could make the terms for joining very attractive. Terms Westminster might want to match, who knows.Everyone seems to think that an independent Scotland would be a bit of a basket case, like Greece in , or Ireland in the s, or even Venezuela today. This is carrying national pessimism, and Unionist propaganda, too far. Greece and Ireland were economically backward countries who joined fixed currency arrangements with more productive neighbours. That left them with an over-valued currency, which made their exports uncompetitive, and the state burdened with debt it couldnrsquot inflate away.Scotland is a wealthy country with high earnings and labour productivity, bankable natural resources and a sophisticated financial sector. Indeed, the problem for an independent Scotland, were it to introduce its own stand-alone currency, might be that the currency appreciates too rapidly, making Scottish exports uncompetitive the other way, rather as happened to Denmark in the s.International finance is aware of the  billion barrels of known oil reserves in the North Sea, evenUnionist politicians donrsquot talk about it in front of the children. Scotland is emerging as a world leader also in renewable energy, possesses formidable intellectual capital in her world-class universities and has a flourishing tourist industry. Scotland also has, by the by, a commodity that accounts for nearly a quarter of all UK food and drink exports: whisky.The fear that Scotland, even with the spending deficit left by the Barnett Formula, would be seen as a bad financial bet is almost certainly . This isnrsquot Venezuela or Nigeria, or Ukraine or Greece. Scotlandrsquos posture towards the international financial markets should be one of strength and confidence, and not fearful insecurity.And while a stand-alone currency might give maximum financial control, a currency union should not be dismissed as incompatible with independence. France and Germany are in a currency union but they are still independent countries. There is a reason why small countries like Slovakia, Slovenia and Latvia, are enthusiasts for the euro, even though it diminishes national sovereignty. This is because it makes for currency stability and ensures a level playing field.However, toto my initial argument: talking about currency is getting the financial cart before the constitutional horse. Therersquos a good practical reason why most countries seeking independence betray a studied vagueness about currency arrangements: they just donrsquot know how things are going to pan out.Read more: People more open to case for independence over Brexit, says Nicola SturgeonWhen the Czech Republic and Slovakia decided to go their own ways in the Velvet Divorce in , they thought initially that a currency union would make sense. It rapidly became clear that it didnrsquot. So they split in a fairly improvised way ndash at one point sticking stamps on bills to indicate which country they belonged to. But it worked. After initial disruption ndash and letrsquos be honest, any financial separation involves disruption ndash Slovakia powered ahead, with a devalued currency and flat taxes. It has been one of the fastest-growing countries in the EU ever since.Slovakiarsquos is not a course that social democratic Scotland would probably wish to emulate, but then it wouldnrsquot have to. Scottish independence,and when it arrives, will anyway be a process not an event, and will take place over a number of years, perhaps decades. When Australia became ally independent, along with Canada, following the Statute of Westminster in , it pegged its currency to the UK pound, and then evolved its own.The row in the SNP is essentially about austerity, not the merits of an independent currency. The First Minister has broadly accepted the Unionist argument that Scotland would be burdened with a pound billion deficit upon becoming independent, and that it would have to reduce that by curbing public spending for a decade. Her critics, led by the former MP George Kerevan and the Campaign for an Independent Currency believe that Scotland would be chained to the Bank of England and that the spending constraints would be similar to George Osbornersquos in . But even Mr Kerevan accepts that adopting a new currency would take time ndash about five years.It is commendable that the SNP should be thinking about the mechanics of currency, but it canrsquot do so in the abstract. There are many ways to skin the currency cat. Once there is a national consensus for separating from the UK, forging a currency consensus will be very much easier."},{"url":null,"title":"boris-premiership-would-increase-urgency-for-scots-tories-to-become-more-autonomous-sister-party-says-mp","story":"As Theresa May comes under more pressure from within her own party to name the day of her departure from No , Conservative minds are turning to who should succeed her.A new poll for the Conservative Home website, involving , people, suggested the former Foreign Secretary was now the clear favourite, polling almost a third of party members at . per cent up by  points on a similar poll last month. Mr Johnsonrsquos nearest rival was fellow Brexiteer Dominic Raab, the former Brexit Secretary, who polled . per cent.But the prospect of the Old Etonian becoming PM has left several Scottish Conservatives aghast with some believing a Johnson premiership would be a gt for Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP and would ldquokill off Ruth Davidsonrsquos chances of becoming First Minister in the  Holyrood poll.Stephen Kerr, the Tory MP for Stirling, dismissed the Conservative Home poll as having asked a section of activists, who were not representative of the party as a whole, but admitted Mr Johnson was a ldquotremendously engaging person.ldquoLetrsquos face it Boris is a celebrity politicianhellipIf you wanted a dinner guest to enliven your evening, yoursquod definitely have Boris to dinner. But does that necessarily make him the person you want to be prime minister  I would venture not.Mr Kerr suggested Mr Johnson had never cultivated an image among Scottish voters, who did not view him as an attractive figure. Indeed party sources have suggested to The Herald that during the  independence referendum campaign the London MP was deliberately kept out of Scotland for fear his presence would have a negative effect on the No campaign.The Stirling MP warned thatScottish Tories did not create enough of a distinctive brand, then they could become ldquoabsorbed in some of the backwash from having Boris Johnson as leader.Although he made clear that the ldquostop Boris mood within Tory ranks at Westminster was such that he did not believe the -year-old politician would succeed Mrs May as leader.

Despite what our First Minister might be hoping for, the priorities of the Scottish population do not match those of her party.

That news will bring on a collective weary yawn theand breadth of Scotland.What seems to be forgotten by the SNP leadership is that the votes of the converted are already there and counted. The people Nicola Sturgeon needs to convince are those with perhaps a smidgen of sympathy for her cause, not her own zealots and not the majority of Scots, who are equally convinced that keeping the UK intact is by far the best way forward for our country.These bland statements of hers are tediously repetitive and merely turn off even more possible recruits for her cause. It is time for some honesty and I am afraid that is a quality the SNP simply does not have.Alexander McKay,  New Cut Rigg, Edinburgh.DOUGLAS Mayerwrites that ldquofrom the start, devolution was not what it was cracked up to be, but the even more serious dficulty is its potential within the UK is limited.Holyroodrsquos initial powers were limited to areas previously managed by the Scottish Office like health, education and so on, so it seemed there were few implications for the UK. The sum the Scottish Office would have spent was instead sent to Holyrood which would determine its own priorities considering the balance of power there at the time. There were though, unforeseen consequences as when priorities in Scotland erged, as they inevitably would, from those where in the UK, it led to complaints about ldquofree this and free that in Scotland when things such as prescriptions and Higher Education fees for instance, had to be paid by the inidual where.That, apparently simple problem is, however, symptomatic of a deeper issue, the historical degree of centralisation of the UK state. As former Second Secretary at the Treasury, Sharon White, said the UK is ldquoalmost the most centralised developed country in the world. One sign of this is that local government collects only about five per cent of the revenue that it spends. Even in highly centralised France, the comparable figure is  per cent. While income tax has been devolved, some  per cent of tax raised in Scotland remains dependent on decisions made in London.Thus, the \"centre of gravity\" of the UK remains in London. However, the dficulty is that, having largely got to grips with those matters that have been devolved, almost inevitably the Scottish Parliament was going to come looking for other powers, some of which were made available by the Scotland Act  as a result of the Smith Commission.However, whether these are enough to satisfy expectations in Scotland is moot. We can argue this either way, but, while devolution has allowed a historically unparalleled ersity of provision in the UK, it is no less clear that demands for more powers for the Scottish Parliament could eventually undermine in a fundamental way the centralised integrity of the UK Parliament. Indeed, as I think there is agreement that some of the powers to be repatriated after Brexit include some that are devolved but will be retained by Westminster, it is possible that we may already be slightly past that point. It is clear, though, that the potential of devolutionrsquos ambition in a centralised state is limited. Indeed, to some extent the two are at odds.Of course, more ersity would be possible in a federal state, but there seems little serious appetite for this at Westminster. Moreover, federalism would require a written constitution, which in turn would mean the distribution of power in the state would no longer be ldquopower retained at Westminster, but that Westminsterrsquos powers would be codied and limited by that written constitution. Therefore, to end the impasse that devolution leads to requires power to be no longer ldquopower retained, but a relationship of equals, with defined powers.Alasdair Galloway, Silverton Avenue, Dumbarton.Read more: Tom Gordon ndash The complex dance between Brexit and IndyrefJAMES Campbellrsquossays England would allow Scotland to ldquosink with a banana republic currency withpenal interest rates, galloping inflation...

It might have a knock-on effect and encourage people to open up about other problems.”The new sessions will run alongside the services currently provided by the charity.Y Suffer in Silence is delighted to have received support from Fraserburgh Football Club and local councillor Brian Topping for the new service.Looking to the future, the charity aims to roll the Walking Talking Therapy out across Aberdeenshire.To help with this, Y Suffer in Silence has organised six public meetings to be held across the region to give residents the opportunity to learn more about the service and to also provide vital feedback.The first meeting was held in Fraserburgh on Wednesday, April , however other meetings have been organised in locations across Aberdeenshire.The next meeting will be held at the MACBI Community Hub in Mintlaw on Friday, April  from -pm.Future meetings have been organised at Whitehills Public Hall on Wednesday, May  Destiny Church Hall in Peterhead on Wednesday, May  Daviot Village Hall on Friday, May , and Ellon Community Centre on Wednesday, May .All of these meetings will run from -pm and everyone is welcome to come along.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"You could win this brand new Vauxhall Corsa\"  Car up for grabs in charity raffleviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Michael McDonnell and Supt Louise Blackelock issued their safety message at the launch of the  campaign.

Off-sales have been approved from am to pm Monday to Sunday.However, among ious conditions imposed by the licensing standards team, it was also agreed that the outdoor space to the rear of the premises will not be utilised by customers until a full licence is granted.The licensing board heard from Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.She added: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.“They have undertaken the fit-out works at the business entirely at their own risk.”But licensing standards officer Lisa Gordini reminded the board that while a provisional licence had been applied for, it would not be discussed until the board’s June meeting and could receive representations or objections which could impact on BrewDog’s operation.She maintained there was an argument that the board should not be granting any occasional licences which may “conflict with the consultation process” of the provisional licence application.After considerable debate, board member Robbie Withey proposed refusal of the application, saying the authority expected a six-month consultation period to process applications and that the company – which operates  bars around the world – should have applied sooner.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Andy Beattie will be honoured with a new road named after him at Midmill Business Park\"  Honour for football manager viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"But admitting that the application was “a dficult one”, Gwyneth Petrie proposed making an “absolute exception” to usual practice and proposed approval."},{"url":null,"title":"strong demand at thainstone sale","story":"Over , buyers and sellers attended Thainstone#s collective sale of plant, machinery and equipment on Saturday, April .The sale saw an outstanding , lots forward, and the auction team sold  per cent of all items entered both on-site and online.Commenting Mark Barrack, Head of Specialist Auctions at ANM Group, said: “A strong crowd of buyers was present last week at our April collective auction, which saw consistent prices achieved for good quality lots across all categories.“The day’s leading prices came from two JCB CX excavators which were purchased using our online bidding  and sold to a buyer in England.

Ensuring that all breastfeeding mums have a reassuring and supportive network is vital.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the event of any archaeological discoveries of interest, SSEN Transmission has said it is committed to ensuring these are fully documented, preservedpossible, with the findings shared with interested parties.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Let’s therefore hope that this week the First Minister stands by her own words, and doesn’t cave in to her activists ahead of SNP conference.“Nicola Sturgeon should uphold the Sturgeon Test. Scotland doesn’t want yet more referendums – we want to move on and focus on the things that matter: improving our schools, making our streets safer and growing high quality jobs in Scotland.”A stand-off currently exists between the Scottish Government and Westminster over a second referendum. Power over the constitution lies with the UK government and Prime Minister Theresa May has so far rejected Sturgeon’s demands insisting, ‘Now is not the time.’A poll by the pro-independence Progress Scotland organisation earlier this month concluded that support for independence had fallen to below  per cent.But SNP deputy leader Keith Brown, who has been tasked with preparing the case for a second independence campaign, said Brexit turmoil has seen a backlash against the pro-Union parties in Scotland.“Since , across Westminster, the SNP have often been the only adults in the room, the only party focused on offering a serious sensible way forward out of the Brexit mess,” he said.“The Scottish Tories have completely sold out Scotland’s interests over Brexit and are happy to let Westminster do whatever they want to Scotland. “Meanwhile, Labour are quietly signing up to deliver a Tory Brexit – against the wishes of the people of Scotland – and without putting the issue back to the people. Labour and the Tories no longer have a positive vision to offer the people of Scotland. They are running scared of any debate over Scotland’s future.Sturgeon’s comments at the manesto launch came before the Brexit vote later that year which saw a majority of Scots vote to remain in the EU as the UK voted to leave. She insists this represented a “material change” in circumstances which opened the door for another vote.The pro-independence majority at the Scottish Parliament, combining SNP and Green MSPs, has also voted in favour of a second referendum being held.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed. It will take us, at least, ten years to rejoin, accepting the euro, the Common FIsheries Policy and austerity invoking budget restrictions to manage our large budget deficit.So why is the SNP stamping about, #greetin der een oot#, about Scots #being dragged out of the UK against their wishes#, when their defining policy, independence, will take us out, unlikely, ever to rejoin Humbug!# EA_Scotland_and_the_EU#Whether or not one is in favour of Brexit, how many people truly knew what they were voting for in   Misinformation and disinformationflew about like panic stricken puffins and some politicians loved it.So much of what was involved came to light over the time which has elapsed and STILL confusion reigns. Thank goodness the leadership during the Second World War was not as pathetic as the present incumbents are.Meanwhile, those nations over the other side of the English Channel must be wondering why the Brits are allowing themselves to be so humiliated ..What about the  that stayed away# So very true today.Spot on Ian !! Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn.

That#s not democracypeter has got it wrong again there was no cheating in the leave side#What started out as a witch-hunt by the political establishment in what they thought was the largest political scandal investigating Cambridge Analytica and Goddard Gunster’s alleged involvement in the Leave.EU referendum campaign, has today been proven to be . Instead, the Electoral Commission fined us on technicalities and an overspend of £,, not the £, originally presented by them on £ million overall spend. The fines were reduced and the Judge accepted the technical breaches were ‘mistakes’ rather than calculated wrong-doings and crucially held there were ‘no findings that Leave.EU had been dishonest.#”#.Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats  Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee:The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers. Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.Anotherthe pro-Brexit mega-rich Torie Peter, # The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP tweeted that he would supporting the Brexit Party #for one-time only# as he wants to secure the UK#s departure from the EU.# Head out of tail end time perhaps!!!I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity. Let’s face it, Brexit never really meant Leave.Maybe the times really are changing. The Tories are in the process of self-destruction, Corbyn#s labour has never been more extream, proven racist anti-semitic with a gutless leader failing on so many levels. The Liberals more or less wiped out, the Greens one MP has a Ph, D in Elizabethan sexual practices and the SNP leader under investigation for breaking the Ministerial code and former leader and strong man on , charges of alleged attempted rape and multiple sexual assaults! All at the same time as the eco Lunatics are super glueing themselves to trains. Hard to make that lot all up. The one good point is that UKIP having jumped into bed with Tommy Robinson and his anti-Islamic White supremacists are being wiped out by Farage and the Brexit party. Well, every cloud has a silver lining. Strange times indeed!!!Strange times indeed # the founder of The Brexit Part had to resign last month for racist and anti-Islamic statements. And these are the new #moderates# Aberdeen university has just shown the same islamiphobia by taking the sultan of Brunei#s degree from him for being a good muslim and implementing islamic law in his country.For the benefit of some, especially Peter Hamilton and David Spence, one of your very own, wealthy Torie and meg rich man, ” The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP, George Galloway.Tory  The word is derived from the gaelic or Irish,meaning an outlaw,brigand,or thief, very descriptive of the modern day Conservative party is it not.Another example of the language being used in everyday speech but George Gallowaymmm a de ken,the jury is oot on that ane!Tory  That name derives from ! I think some of us have moved on a bit since then, Graham Fleming, but there will always be a place for infantile name-calling, especially when a depth of comment is so shallow.Ali’s statement is not one everyone would post. Aberdeen University was rejecting the autocratic imposition of a particularly hard-line act of Islamism. Such Islamism is not Islam. Resisting the Sultan’s imposition of restrictions on the freedoms of others is not Islamaphobic, as Ali may already know. Conflating these issues into a  statement, whilst describing the Sultan as a good Muslim, is something an islamaphobe might do, but pointing this out in neutral terms will probably see me attacked for being intolerant.There are hard-line inflexible dogmatic literalists in all major faiths, and the assembled texts of any faith are often contradictory. There are also people who hide their malicious agendas behind statements that might be designed to appear innocuous at first glance. It may seem a little pointless trying to make this kind of thing clear to closeminded hardliners, but the tricks extremists use to influence others have to be exposed. Otherwise we’ll have to live in the kind of society they want, and heaven help us then. It may help to remember that Scotland only abandoned trying to “cure” homosexuality with electro-shock therapy as recently as . Securing a tolerant global community required international cooperation: hence the EU.Sadly Islamophobia is alive and kicking on Shetland. I had to forcefully point out to one of my former, supposedly rational patients, that her extreme views on immigrants were pure fiction. Her online rant  claim being that our immigrant population were full of infectious diseasesand a danger to ourcommunity. That is a total fiction promoted by a malicious racist. She was mirroring a neo-nazi website sadly with the backing of several Shetland folk. She became very agitated when I pointed out to her oral and general health was no better nor worse than many of my overseas immigrant patients. Needless to say, I was cascaded with a barrage of insults and threats. Thankfully she and her like-minded bigots blocked me on Facebook, thank God for small mercies!"},{"url":null,"title":"footballers portraits to be auctioned as fundraiser for under 12s ","story":"Four paintings of footballers are available in the auction with all money raised going towards travel costs for the Shetland under-s trip to Glasgow for the Glasgow City Cup.Artist Balazs Onhausz with his football-inspired art. page.People can bid for the works up until th May with coaches hoping to raise around £, or £ per artwork.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733277.jpg--.jpg?1555495901000\n","title":"ballymena city of the eight towers","story":"Local children have created a new fantasy tower to add to Ballymena’s famous ‘crest’ !And it is one of a number of striking features on is new imagination-fuelled mural which has appeared asby magic in Bryan Street, with the help of Artists Leo Boyd, Laura Nelson and local children.Workshops were held in The Braid Arts Centre on the theme of comics and cartoons and, as a result, local children have delivered a new fabulous monster sized artwork for the town centre.The Bryan Street painting, which is part of a larger arts project called Opening Doors being delivered by the Arts Service of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, was supported and partnered by BID, which is the Ballymena Improvement District.BID and Councils Arts Service identied some sites in the town centre for re-imaging and engaged professional mural artists to deliver workshops for local children.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"riann s passion is a work of art","story":"THERE isn#t much Riann Coulter doesn#t know about Irish artists and her enthusiasm is infectious. As curator of the council-run F.E. McWilliam Gallery, Irish art is her specialty and it all started with F.E. McWilliam himself.The Trinity Art History and English graduate, who went on complete a Master’s Degree in Modern Art at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, first nurtured her interest with an A-Level art project on the McWilliam Studio – now part of an external exhibit at the titular venue where she works.It has been an intriguing journey for the former Banbridge Academy student and one which has brought her full circle after stop-offs in Dublin, where she took her first job in the Irish Museum of Modern Art, and in New York as a researcher on American patronage of Irish art.Happily, her job is also her passion and it is hard not to be swept away by the Coulter bonhomie - an oddity in the raried stratosphere of the art world today.But opening up the joys of all types of art to visitors from all backgrounds - including renowned works by established artists to stunning offerings from up-and-coming students - is her mission and she will not be deterred.Even diners in the popular cafe at the gallery are surrounded by art and unwittingly soak it up. It is in the gardens, on the walls and in the display cabinets. It is probably even in the food. You may not always see it, but art is a state of mind as much as anything  and this knowledgeable and friendly curator is determined to help you source it out.“We get very interesting responses from people who come in to view the ious exhibitions and it is great to observe them,” says Riann. “Comments range from, ‘That’s rubbish’, to a deep moving in the soul. That is how it should be art is an emotional response and it is okay not to like some of it - as long is you engage with what you see and you know why you don’t like it, it’s fine by me.”So far, there hasn’t been much not to like. Virtually every exhibition staged since she took the job in  has proved a success and her latest project - the definitive ‘Blackshaw at ’ collectionis a case in point.Organising the Blackshaw exhibition has probably been the highlight so far,” she says. “And it has been brilliant that we got it first - before it goes to Dublin. Usually it’s the other way around.”For this latest exhibition she literally stripped the paintings from people’s walls in homes across Ireland, from Cork to Sligo, and acknowledges the “generosity” of collectors happy to part with their treasured ‘Blackshaws’ for the duration of the show. The artist himself, a now frail and introverted character who shuns the limelight, was even persuaded to attend the opening night although he didn’t take to the microphone himself when it was time for speeches. Unquestionable integrity of school principal and Naval Reserve officer Simon Harper Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“Basil doesn’t like crowds, so it was great to have him here in person,” says Riann. “We have  paintings in total, charting his early work up until the style he had developed while in his seventies. He told me he was still painting today, but his hands aren’t what they used to be and he was disappointed it had taken him two weeks to complete a composition, when in his younger days he would finish a painting in two days.”The next exhibition planned for when the Blackshaw exhibits are dismounted in October is a display of work from talented members of Banbridge Camera Club - yet another move to pass ownership of gallery space onto the local community.“We like to try to engage with all types of art - traditional paintings, modern abstracts, crafts or visual art,” Riann explains. “It is a case of trying to make everyone feel there is something for them, no matter what their age or outlook.”The best bit of her job, she says, is discovering new talent, while the worst is falling in love with the art on the gallery walls and wanting it herself - her real weakness is spying a surreal, quirky take on something traditional, although she also loves mulling over “small, quiet paintings” as well.Then there are the long days leading up to opening nights: “It can be stressful, pulling everything together for an exhibition, but you learn to get by on adrenalin,” she smiles. “Resources are always an issue in the Arts and we work with a small team here, so you can go home feeling quite knackered.”When she does go home, it is to physicist husband David and toddler son Callan - already showing a prodigious interest in art “by drawing on the furniture” - but she finds it dficult to ‘switch off’.“Art is part of daily le and even on holiday I am always popping into art galleries to see what’s new and interesting,” she adds. “We work three years in advance, so I have to forward-plan a lot.“I think we are very lucky here in Banbridge. There is so much home-grown talent on our doorstep and we have this great venue in this great location. “Galleries can sometimes be intimidating places but it is our aim to engage with everyone and provide the complete visitor experience through workshops, lectures and supper evenings We have also just set up a ‘Friends’ of the gallery organisation which has proved really popular and brings people together.”And she goes home happiest when she sees someone react to what is in front of them: “Once I saw a woman cry over a painting because it touched her in special way. Art is such a subjective thing and that is the beauty of it. It doesn’t really matter what it makes you feel, as long as it makes you feel something.”"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"The Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.

They know they are in the UK but don’t realise they are on a dferent land mass to England. We provide basic information on housing, hospitals, police serviceand run walkabouts and talk-abouts to bring people around and show them basic things like buying a bus ticket or using an ATM. These are things that you and I take for granted.“Our other main thing is the reach to resilience programme. We deliver family support across Belfast. This can be everything from learning to say no, IT skills, safety on the internet and workshops.“The European employment service programme also provides information on free movement on labour across Europe, something which is attracting huge interest given the threats of Brexit.”It is perhaps the John Hewitt Bar, located just around the corner from the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre, which is the hidden gem of the organisation.Not many people know that the BURC own the bar as a social enterprise, meaning all profits go back into funding their key projects outlined here.The bar was the first social enterprise bar set up in the north and continues to run as a competitive business in the Cathedral Quarter, serving food and it is very popular for its range of beers.Aisling says the location of the BURC is beneficial for service users and hopes their programmes will continue to benefit those who need them.“These programmes are hugely important. The centre is located on the outskirts of the city centre, people can come all over. We can reach a wider network of people and bring the programmes to them.“We are also keen to deliver programmes in their own areas before they feel safe to come to the city centre office.“Our overall aim is to try and bring people back into the local community.“One such challenge today is some people coming to us to report incidents of racism because they don’t feel comfortable going to police. We can help support them and give them advice on how to deal with such an issue and not just accept it as an everyday occurrence.“Overall, the general feedback from people has been very positive. For mothers, learning how to say no is an important issue. We want to give people the confidence, skills and knowledge to try things a bit dferently and explore the way they react to things.“Many of our programmes have come out of other ones – all our work is led by the inidual and other service users.“We want to give people skills of a community leader to empower themselves and help them in every way possible.”Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre,- Donegall Street Place,Belfast,BT FNTel:   Email: info@burc.org or esol@burc.org For more information, visit www.burc.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"paddy and nigel taking success in their stride","story":"SINCE he first took up his guitar and hit the stage back in July last year, West Belfast internet sensation Paddy Rafferty has been selling out venues across the city. Fans of the Brooke-based Paddy ‘Raff’ have lapped up his BT alter ego ‘Nigel’ in online sketches such as ‘Nigel at the Christmas Market’, ‘Nigel the BT Tout’, as well as the storming stage performances of ‘Paddy and Nigel Act Their Postcodes’.Set for yet another sell-out run of four shows at the city centre’s Limelight venue, Paddy told the Andersonstown News that he is “gobsmacked” at the response to his on stage routines and that of ‘Bravo Tango er’ Nigel. “It’s class,” said Paddy, “I remember when the hosepipe ban was in full effect last year, thinking what kind’ve voice would go with someone who would tout on his neigbours and their over-use of their hose pipe. “The character of Nigel started with a Snapchat filter. This to me looked like some kind’ve posh dude, the mullet, the aviator glasses and moustache. Luckily it was one you could replicate easily as a lot of the filters are quite contorted. “The first one went viral and featured on BBC Trending NI. At the time I didn’t think it would be a recurring character but people really responded to it, they were like ‘you gotta do more with that posh guy’, I just kept going back to it, it’s a pure fluke how it came about,” he said. Since Paddy took to the stage at the Palm House in Belfast and Derry’s Nerve Centre, he has performed to thousands of comedy fans during a series of three sold-out shows at the MAC theatre in March.  “I remember when the MAC tickets went on sale, I checked the tickets and the map was completely grey, I thought ‘maybe I’ve got that the wrong away about ’, but a second show was penciled in and within two hours of that going onsale we put on a third one. “The Limelight is  people capacity and three of the shows are already gone, the fourth one is approaching sell-out. I’m blown away. Basically I’m responding to the demand that’s out there.”Paddy spoke of how he is working with producers to develop ideas for TV both here and across the water. “I’ve a massive, massive list of ideas for more sketches. I’m sort of a one man band, still a full-time dad and it’s like anything it’s getting the time. I’m making the time for it now, it’s not a nine-to-five job in that you are at the desk. My we and I have fantastic support from our families so that is great to have. “I’ve achieved more than I ever thought I would, it’s not even been a year since the first solo show. I’ve put a lot of effort into this show and want to let as many people come to see it before moving on. At the minute I’m looking at a bigger venue for a new show, possibly towards the end of the year.I’ve loads of ideas and it’s been great to have received the support and reception the show has so far to date had.”Paddy and Nigel at the Limelight takes place on Sunday May .

The President will deliver a speech to mark the historic occasion as the £. million three-storey building in the Gaeltacht Quarter prepares to open its doors to visitors for the first time. Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, Harry Connolly, told the Andersonstown News that it was an “honour” to have the President open the centre.“James Connolly lived on the Falls Road just yards away from the location of the new Visitor Centre,” he said. “He was a man of formidable ideas and remarkable vision. Over  years after James Connolly was executed, his values, his ideas and the example he gave us in le are as inspiring and relevant as ever.”Harry Connolly said: “It is entirely fitting and appropriate that the President of Ireland will officially open the James Connolly Visitor Centre and pay tribute to Connolly’s colossal contribution to our nation and to the lives of so many across the world.” As well as the President’s visit,  trade union leaders from  dferent unions have also arrived in the city to attend the opening including General President of the Labourers’ International Union of North AmericaTerry O’Sullivan and Rocco Davis, Vice President and Regional Manager of Pacic Southwest Region of . James Connolly travelled to the US and is strongly linked with the trade union movement in the States.Harry continued: “The realisation of Áras Uí Chonghaile is another major step forward for the success story that is West Belfast tourism. Supported by the Connolly family and funded by Belfast City Council and the US Trade Union Movement, this new visitor centre will have a major social and economic impact on Belfast’s Gaeltacht Quarter, attracting thousands of visitors from across the globe every year. “We are inviting everyone to take part in the James Connolly Parade, leaving Conway Mill at pm on Good Friday and parading along the Falls Road to arrive at Áras Uí Chonghaile at .pm. “Outside the front of the centre a number of guest speakers headed by President Higgins will speak, and Irish singing star Frances Black will perform live along with renowned Belfast balladeer Terry ‘Cruncher’ O’Neill. “We are saying to everyone, from the Falls Road, from Belfast, from across Ireland and from further afield, come along and take part in the parade and attend the opening ceremony outside Áras Uí Chonghaile.

Situated in Antrim’s hills, the Crumlin derives its name from the Irish ‘An Cromghlinn’, meaning The Crooked Glen, which is the name adopted by one the town’s most exciting new pubs.Headed up by North Belfast businessman Laurence Burns and his brother Damien, The Crooked Glen is bringing the original meaning of the name Crumlin back into everyday use in the town and breathing new le into one of the Main Street’s most prominent buildings.Laurence has spent the last -years leading operations at the popular city centre nightclub, Thompson’s Garage, and has also worked on a number of the city’s biggest events and festivals, including our own Best of the North awards ceremony. However, when the opportunity to run his own bar and restaurant arose he jumped at the opportunity, and while aiming to bring something new to the area he said paying homage to the town’s Irish-speaking heritage was vital.“I was always trying to keep my ear to the ground so that when a pub came up I would be in contention for it,” he said.“I had done that through Jeeves Limited and then the opportunity came up just before Christmas.“There was an opportunity for me to take it on – along with my brother who is my business partner – and give it a wee bit more care and attention.“It had been O’Connor’s twice before under two dferent businesses. The previous owner was O’Connor and the guy who took it on firstly was O’Connor, so I didn’t want to be the third O’Connor’s and that’s where the Crooked Glen came into it. There’s a big Irish speaking community up in Crumlin and I just thought they would appreciate that the name came from Irish origins. That’s where the name came from and it has gotten a really good response.“I got a logo and then used the boys from North Belfast Graphic to implement the artwork outside on the walls, the menus, and all the rest of it.”He continued: “I fell in love with it the first time I came into it. I just loved the character of it.“The first time I came in was as a customer, I sat downstairs and had a bit of craic with a few of the locals who are now my regulars. They were giving me a bit of stick and saying thatyou’re eating in here you have to keep the fire filled up. We were just having a bit of banter – I actually did get up and put a bit of coal on the fire. I hadn’t even seen upstairs at that stage, but I had my lunch and said to Damien that I had a really good feeling about the place. I knew I liked it right away, I had a feeling for it and I could see the potential.”In terms of its space, The Crooked Glen has it all – a cosy fireside bar, a beautul upstairs restaurant and a fantastic outdoor area. In the short six weeks since taking over the venue, the Burns brothers have implemented an exciting new menu, improved service standards and have lined up a number of talented artists for their weekly live music sessions.“The responses and reviews that I’m getting is that we’ve taken a bit of creativity from Belfast and brought it up into Crumlin – that’s no disrespect to anything that was already up here,” Laurence said.“It’s the first time that things have been done in this way up here. In the restaurant it will be a bit more of a service led experience, downstairs is your good hearty pub grub with the music, the fire and the pints, upstairs you have a bit more of a refined dining experience.”By offering everything from food to live music and sports, The Crooked Glen aims to have “something for everybody” in the town.“I don’t think Crumlin has had that calibre of musician here on a regular basis. We want to bring the best of what we can afford here, we can’t charge on the door, but we’ll put on the best music possible with a ied selection on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”He added: “Crumlin sometimes feels like you’re in Donegal because it has that country village feeling, but you’re also on the doorstep of Belfast, so people are used to going in and out of the city and sampling what it has to offer.“We’re trying to take the good things that are in Belfast and the good things of village le in Crumlin and combine them into what should be a strong brand in the Crooked Glen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the pen is mightier than the sword","story":"Address by Father Martin Magill at the funeral of Lyra McKee at St Anne#s Cathedral.May I speak in the Name of the Living God.First of all, I want to thank Dean Stephen Forde for his kind invitation to give this reflection today. I have no idea what you Sara, Lyra’s partner must have felt on Thursday night when those shots rang out and Lyra was hit and fell to the ground.I can’t begin to imagine what you Lyra’s mum, and you her sisters and brothers must have gone through when Sara phoned to tell you Lyra had been shot. I can’t imagine the agony of your drive to Altnagelvin hospital knowing that Lyra had died.Many of us here in this cathedral have been praying for you since we heard the dreadful news and will continue to do so.Since the story of Lyra’s murder broke on Holy Thursday into Good Friday, there has been an enormous sense of grief and solidarity with you from many people at this huge injustice. Many, many wonderful things have been said about her including the warm and deserved tributes paid to her by the Secretary of State and by MPs of all parties in the House of Commons yesterday evening. In death Lyra, has united people of many dferent backgrounds, as further evidenced by this erse congregation at her funeral.Like so many others I couldn’t believe it when I heard the am news on Good Friday morning that Lyra McKee had been shot dead the previous night. I’d met Lyra on several occasions, we had kept in contact by phone, ‘what’s app’,and Twitter. I would however have to confess that I wasn’t aware of her great love of Harry Potter. I hadn’t heard the term ‘Hufflepuff’ until I did an internet search and found this definition # ‘Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play.’ It struck me that the definition could just as easily have been about Lyra. Whilst Harry Potter didn’t feature in our conversations what did and it was our last exchange on Twitter at the end of March when Lyra tweeted me with a photo of herself dressed in a nun’s veil with a glass of cider accompanied with these words: ‘Got roped into performing as part of a Sister Act tribute act for Foyle Hospice. Hey @MartinJMagill, you need any help with mass tomorrow ’Let me give a brief overview of Lyra’s le. She was born on st March . She attended Holy Family PS just off the Limestone Road. In her early days at school, she struggled with reading and required extra support.Things changed dramatically when one of her teachers, Mr O’Neill began to read to her class The Twits by Roald Dahl. This was the spark that got Lyra interested in reading and then thanks to her granny Patricia Lawrie buying her each of the Harry Potter books as they were published this led to her le long interest in Harry Potter and later on to exchanges in social media with JK Rowling.Lyra’s love of reading was further nurtured when she went to St Gemma’s High School, just off the Oldpark Road also in North Belfast. Her interest in journalism began at the age of  when she wrote for the St Gemma’s school newspaper.Shortly afterwards Lyra became involved in a charity called “The Headliners’ which gives young people a voice by using journalism and media as a tool for learning and campaigning. This project played an important part in her being awarded the Sky News Young Journalist Award . After school and further education, Lyra studied online journalism at Birmingham City University graduating with an MA degree. Over the years her writing has won her much acclaim such as her letter when she was  to her  year old self about growing up as gay in Belfast. In , aged just , she was acknowledged internationallyas an exceptional achiever with an exciting future by Forbes magazine in their  under  listbecause of her work as an investigative reporter.Last month thefeatured Lyra in an article considering the  rising stars of Irish writing. Her memory also lives on in her TEDx talk, #How uncomfortable conversations can save lives”, about the  Orlando nightclub shooting. Her book on the murder of Rev Robert Bradford, the Member of Parliament for South Belfast, called Angels with Blue Faces was due to be published later this year.Lyra came to see me as part of her research on a book she was working on called Lost Boys. We met on several occasions and kept in contact. I knew absolutely nothing about  year old Thomas Spence and  year old John Rodgers, who vanished at a bus stop onthe Falls Road in West Belfast in November . They were both living in St John’s Parish at that time where I am presently the parish priest and it was for this reason Lyra came to see me. By the time Lyra had told me their story and what she hoped to do, I was fully behind her. Nichola her sister who spoke earlier described Lyra like #a dog with a bone’ when she had found something that interested her.I certainly experienced her gentle, determined doggedness. When we exchanged greetings on New Year’s Day and I wished her well not only in the writing of Lost Boys but also in her search for the remains of the boys which she made clear to me was very important to her. She replied in this way: ‘If that#s the only thing that comes out of this, it#ll be worth it. It#s the only thing I really want out of it, to find them and the others.’In the course of her investigations, Lyra had discovered that other children had disappeared and she had wanted to find their bodies.I pray that her work will be taken up and that their bodies will be found and even more importantly that there will be no more ‘lost boys’ or ‘lost girls.’When I consider Lyra’s determination, it strikes me that she was the embodiment of the St Gemma’s school motto: ‘truth and charity.’ On Good Friday, the day on which Christians all over the world recall the suffering and death of Jesus Christ we also wrestle with the mystery of suffering. For you Lyra’s nearest and dearest, you came to know the experience of Good Friday in your own lives. For those of us who follow Jesus, we believe that the shedding of his innocent blood on the cross was enough # in the words of the hymn: ‘the cross has said it all’. We don’t need any more innocent blood to be shed.The irony could not be more poignant when we consider the signing of the Good Friday agreement which was about ensuring there would be no more deaths like Lyra’s. Earlier in this service, we listened to Matthew’s account of the Beatitudes which was chosen by her family in remembrance of Lyra learning these by heart when she was a pupil at St Gemma’s. The beatitude ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God’is very timely. Many of us will be praying that Lyra’s death in its own way will not have been in vain and will contribute in some way to building peace here. Since Thursday night we have seen the coming together of many people in ious places and the unying of the community against violence. I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday. I am however left with a question: ‘Why in God’s name does it take the death of a  year old woman with her whole le in front of her to get us to this point ’ As Christians recalled the death of Jesus on the cross, we remembered that his death was not in vain but was for us the doorway to eternal le. I dare to hope that Lyra’s murder on Holy Thursday night can be the doorway to a new beginning. I detect a deep desire for this. One of Lyra’s friends was reported as saying: ‘We have had enough. There is a younger generation coming up in the town and they don#t need guns put in their hands.They need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ To those who had any part in her murder, I encourage you to reflect on Lyra McKee journalist and writer as a powerful example of ‘The pen is mightier than the sword’.I plead with you to take the road of non violence to achieve your political ends. It was encouraging to see that those who provide a political analysis to the organisation responsible for her death chose to call off their parade on Easter Monday following the call from Fr Joe Gormley, the parish priest in Creggan where Lyra was killed. To those still intent on violence, I ask you to listen to the majority of the people on your beloved island of Ireland who are calling on you to stop. I pay tribute to the courage and determination of the women who in a very powerful gesture of non violence,one by one placed their hands in blood red paint on a wall and said loudly ‘we are not afraid.’ I commend the + people in Creggan who have contacted the police. There is a rule in many of our communities that we do not, we should not, give information to police and that, to do so is to become a ‘tout.’ But that was one of a number of rules # rules that also said that it was OK to brutalise children for petty crimes, or rules that say you can live in the locality until you are told you can’t or rules that said that the only way we could gain ‘freedom’ was by other fellow-human beings losing their lives. But this week I have seen these rules turned on their head. I have seen many people stand up and condemn this culture of violence and coercive control. We need to send a very dferent message and so I appeal to those who have information about Lyra’s murder but who haven#t yet come forward to do so now. If you want to see an end to these brutal rules, and see a new society built on justice and fairness, on hope and not fear, then you can help build that society by letting the police know what you know. There will be special measures put in place to ensure your safety and where you will not be intimidated by coercive controllers,you do so.To the many politicians present in this cathedral today, let me say again those words which one of Lyra’s friends had said: ’the younger generation need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ As politicians you will be familiar with the first report of the Independent Reporting Commission published last October which examined in depth paramilitary style attacks and found a clear correlation between these attacks and areas of social deprivation. Lyra’s friend is right in pointing out that our young people need jobs, and education and training to get those jobs. All our young people need a le that gives them an aspiration for the future. As our politicians we need you to be working together to make that happen so that especially for those living in deprived areas that they will feel the peace process is working for them as well – and especially for young people living in these communities. To the press and media which Lyra was so proud to be part of – I ask you to report on what is being done in these areas – to praise good work where you find it and report when it is not happening. I know you as politicians have a very dficult job to but then so too did Lyra. There is another valuable lesson from her le # she was like ‘a dog with a bone’ when she believed she could make a dference. When it comes to our peace process, I would love to see this dogged attitude to the rebuilding of an Assembly that works for the common good. As I listen to the radio every morning, all I seem to hear about ious initiatives in Northern Ireland are these words, ‘without a minister, this can’t be taken forward’. I pray that Lyra’s murder may be the catalyst needed for parties to start talking, to reform that which was corrosive in previous Assemblies and to begin anew. On Easter Sunday, Christians all over the world celebrated the most important event of the Christian year, the resurrection of Jesus. It was because of his resurrection that we believe in le beyond the grave and in the words of today’s second reading from John : ‘in my Father’s house there are many dwelling places.’ It is in this hope of eternal le and happiness that we gather in prayer and now into the tender mercy of a loving God and Father I commend Lyra McKee. Amen."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was the headquarters for the longest continuous campaign in British military history after troops were sent into Northern Ireland in August  to cope with growing sectarian unrest.What was described as a temporary and emergency move lasted for  years and only ended in , long after the ceasefires by the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries.Organisers say they are disappointed that the Ministry of Defence are not backing their event. They were told by the MoD that they are supporting another Op Banner commemoration which is being staged by the Royal British Legion at the National Memorial arboretum in Staffordshire on Wednesday, August .NIVAs event is being held three days later. And the organisation insist that while their members are concerned about the recent charging of soldiers with historical killings in Northern Ireland like Soldier F in relation to Bloody Sunday, their commemoration on Saturday, August  will be a memorial, not a protest.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetThe day will start in Lisburns Wallace Park with a drumhead service before a parade around the city where wreathes will be laid at three dferent points including the scene of a  explosion which killed six soldiers ing from a charity fun run in a minibus.Other floral tributes will be left at Lisburns war memorial and at a statue in honour of the UDR.Organisers say all veterans will be welcome at the commemoration, dating right back to the B Specials and the RUC along with ex-members of the UDR and the Prison Service.But representatives of the Garda Siochana and the Irish Army have also been invited to take part.\"Its a completely inclusive programme,\" said Ian Simpson, media spokesman for NIVA and the chairman of the NI Prison Service Benevolent Fund.One of the centrepieces of the NIVA remembrance day will be the display of the names of soldiers, police officers and prison staff that died in Northern Ireland.There will be , names on a big screen and in remembrance books, twice the number of personnel listed in official records as having been killed in terrorist attacks.NIVA say their roll of honour also includes men and women who died as a result of suicides, accidents and stress-related illnesses which developed as a result of the Troubles.NIVA say they are not inviting serving military chiefs or Royal family members to the Lisburn event although a retired Army general will take the salute.Ian Simpson said: \"The VIPs on the day will be the widows or the families of the people who died. All the organisations within NIVA will nominate representatives to take the salute too.\"He said the decision to hold a separate memorial event here rather than to take part in the national one in England was because this is where it all happened.\"There will be veterans attending both events,\" added Ian. \"And we will still be going to a ceremony we hold every year at the Ulster Ash Grove at the National Arboretum in September. But we thought it was important to have a local ceremony to remember everyone who died or was hurt.\"Organisers are hoping that upwards of , veterans will take part in the parade with , relatives and members of the public in attendance.Tens of thousands of service personnel were injured in the conflict which saw , soldiers coming to Northern Ireland over the  years of Op Banner.\"Taking in the police and the UDR you are talking about half a million people who saw service,\" said Ian, who added that while remembrance of the dead will be the main priority, it wont be the only focus of the Lisburn event.Old security forces vehicles and a scout helicopter will be there for people to see in the centre of Lisburn along with private collections of unorms, decommissioned weapons and regimental memorabilia.\"We want it to be a special day,\" said Ian, who has urged opponents of the security forces to respect the NIVA commemoration. We will be there to remember our fallen colleagues in a peaceful and dignied way and we would ask everyone to respect our day. We are not out to offend anyone.\"Organisers say the parade around Lisburn will include  local bands who have been issued with strict code of conduct about what is expected of them with no colour parties or flags on display.The original hope was that the Ministry of Defence would have given their approval for military bands to take part but their permission was not forthcoming.\"We were disappointed especially as so many people who were here during Op Banner were serving the MoD and some gave all,\" added Ian.He insisted that NIVA are hoping to avoid controversy on their day of commemoration, especially in the wake of the charging of retired soldiers with murder.In a statement NIVA said: \"Service personnel have to act within the law of the land. But this does not get away from the fact that veterans justiably feel that the scales of justice are tilted against them and that the likes of Soldier F are being sacriced as a sop to placate Republicans whose latent threat of ato violence is seen by them as influencing government policy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"mum behind usstyle camp for autistic children hails impact","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This should be respected. Our position hasn’t changed.”"},{"url":null,"title":"absence of key aide to kim jong un hailed as positive sign in nuclear talks","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Washington and met President Donald Trump twice before Mr Kim’s two summits with Mr Trump.His rise had baffled many North Korea watchers because he handled South Korea ties, not international or US

Yong Chol.The NIS has a mixed record in confirming developments in North Korea.Butconfirmed, Kim Yong Chol’s replacement would add to speculation that he is being sidelined from nuclear diplomacy to take the responsibility for the failure of the February summit in Hanoi.Kim Jong Un, who is desperate to revive his country’s moribund economy, ed home empty-handed from Hanoi after Mr Trump rejected

All four of us slept in the same room. Now I have lost everythingAnusha KumariA photo of her children was on the wall, while on the shelf were small statues of Jesus, Mary and St Sebastian, an early Christian martyr riddled with wounds from Roman arrows.She could see her son’s drum kit on the upstairs landing, a gt from his father after doing well on exams, and a school portrait of her daughter.All day, relatives, neighbours and nuns wandered in and out of the large house, offering food, consolation and prayer.“You won’t believe it, but I had the perfect family,” Mrs Kumari said.“In  years of marriage, my husband and I never argued. All four of us slept in the same room. Now I have lost everything.”Tears mixed with blood from her bandaged right eye.“All these people, they have their own families. They’ll go home and I’ll be alone,” she said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  St Sebastian’s Church in Negombo A brother-in-law, Jude Prasad Appuhami, said his extended family, one of the oldest and most prominent in Catholic-majority Negombo, marked all the religious holidays and rituals at St Sebastian’s, a Gothic-style church patterned after Reims Cathedral in France.On Easter, though, he was not in church with his  relatives because he had to drive a vehicle carrying a statue of Christ for a parade after Mass.Mr Appuhami arrived midway through the service and heard the blast from the car park.He rushed in and was overwhelmed by the sight of so much blood.One of his sisters-in-law, who survived, shouted for him to help their niece.He found her with her eyes open, picked her up and rushed to the hospital, only to realise she was dead.Mr Appuhami’s we and -year-old daughter, sitting in an alcove to the left of the altar, escaped with minor injuries.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Anusha Kumari, centre bottom, with bandages on her left eye touches coffins during a mass burial for her husband, two children and other family members His -year-old daughter, Rusiri, who was sitting at the front of the church because she was going to do a reading from scripture, also survived, but she was left with nerve damage that makes eating painful.On Wednesday, she struggled to grasp what she has seen.“I don’t know how to think of it. It’s like a dream,” she said.During the funeral at the makesht cemetery near St Sebastian’s, where mourners had to pass through security checks, a military drone buzzed overhead as Father Niroshan Perera led prayers for the dead.Mr Perera, who grew up with Mrs Kumari’s husband, Dulip Appuhami, and his siblings, recalled going as a boy with his friends and family to the church’s well, where the faithful believed the water could cure them of diseases.When the funeral ended, Mr Perera encouraged everyone to go home quickly, fearing another attack.Mr Perera, who lost  relatives and friends in the blast, said he no longer trusted the Sri Lankan government to protect his flock."},{"url":null,"title":"nuj hold series rallies lyra mckee laid rest","story":"The National Union of Journalistswill today hold a series of rallies as the funeral of Lyra McKee gets underway in Belfast.-year-old Lyra was killed last Thursday in Derry after being hit by one of a series of rounds fired by the New IRA at the PSNI during rioting in the Creggan estate.A statement on the NUJ website is asking for a show of solidarity from everyone at pm today.It says: \"On Wednesday, April  NUJ officials and members will join with the heartbroken family, friends and colleagues of Lyra McKee at her funeral service in St Anne’s Cathedral, Belfast.\"Lyra’s murder on Thursday night is a devastating blow to her partner and family, and to her many friends and colleagues throughout the NUJ.

Limerick had a few half chances, but couldnrsquot convert. lsquoHinch had chances of their own, including Alex Millarrsquos reverse shot which flew inches wide of the net.Millar was in the thick of it again minutes later. This time Stuart Hunterrsquos driving run from midfield found Millar open in the circle. He slipped the ball to the energetic Scott Leetch, who calmly slotted the ball into the goal to make it -.Limerick fought back and got themselves another goal before the half -time interval to make it -.After the restart the game had settled slightly and Ballynahinch started to get into a pattern of maintaining the ball effectively.With that, lsquoHinch were racking up the short corners, seven were won, but for some excellent defending and goalkeeping kept them at bay.With  minutes to go Ballynahinch took the lead again, this time through William Edgar.A few minutes later a piece of brilliance from Edgar made it - after a superb solo run matched with a spectacular finish.As expected, Limerick flooded men forward along with countless aerial passes, making it dficult for lsquoHinch to get out of their half.Limerick pulled one back with a short corner routine with five minutes remaining, but Ballynahinch had the ability to see out the game and lt the trophy for the third time in the clubrsquos history.A big thank you to all the supporters that spurred the men on in Dublin on Saturday, it was very much appreciated.

Itrsquos a great experience not to be missed.The material, including the discovery of  skeletons, has thrown up some interesting information on the Benedictine Abbey which occupied the site during the medieval period, as well as tantalising glimpses into the early Christian monastic site that was located there from the eighth century AD.Three trenches were excavated in the immediate vicinity of Holy Trinity Cathedral, two located in the old tennis courts and one located on the grass verge directly in line with the Cathedralrsquos west door, in advance of the replica of St Patrickrsquos Cross being installed.The trench on the verge revealed the existence of a substantial medieval cemetery with  skeletons being uncovered.Three of these were put forward for radiocarbon dating and the dates have recently been ed.The lowermost burial ed a date of - AD which indicates that this person lived and died before the Anglo-Norman invasion of  AD and before the present Abbey church was constructed on the site.This person would have lived at a time when the round tower mdash knocked down when the cathedral was refurbished around  mdash was still in use. The latest burial encountered ed a date of - AD showing that this person lived and died when the site was occupied by the Benedictine Abbey.Analysis of the skeletons is ongoing, but initial results of the latest burial indicate it to be a young, female, adult with severe dental trauma.The excavation in the tennis courts uncovered the kitchen and midden pit of the Benedictine Abbey.Site director Brian Sloan explained: ldquoA rich picture of medieval le was uncovered with masses of animal bone and pottery being recovered. We can use this evidence to build up a picture of the diet and everyday activities of the monks who lived and prayed here. The large pottery sherds have been painstakingly pieced together at QUB giving an idea of the shape, size and decoration of the vessels.He continued: ldquoA rich environmental picture is being established through the processing of the soil samples taken during the excavation. A multitude of blackberry seeds, sloe pips and fish bones have been recovered as well as charred wheat grains.Scientic techniques are now helping to identy and date the finds. An array of metalwork was recovered from the midden pit consisting of copper alloy and corroded iron artefacts, and these have been analysed and x-rayed. This has allowed us to see objects beneath the corrosion and the results have been quite startling. A number of items have been identied, including fine copper alloy dress pins, a socketed arrowhead, a horseshoe, a pair of iron shears and even aof chain with a suspension hook still attached.In addition, three samples mdash charred grain, charcoal and a fragment of twig mdash were put forward for radiocarbon dating.The twig fragment ed a date range of - AD which fits very well with the pottery types recovered from the midden pit. However, the charred grain and charcoal ed very similar dates of - AD and - AD respectively.This indicates that earlier activity relating to the early Christian monastic site of the th Century AD, when the original St Patrickrsquos Cross was erected, is there and waiting to be uncovered.A number of finds have now been placed on display in the High Cross Gallery at Down County Museum, in two new cases funded by the British Museum Trust, while research work continues on the collection of artefacts, dating from the Mesolithicthrough to modern times.This project was supported by the European Unionrsquos PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body .Match-funding for this project has been provided by The Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department for Rural and Community Development in Ireland.To find out how to get involved in the excavation in August, contact Down County Museum on   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch teams are All Ireland champions  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH was at the centre of Irelandrsquos sporting world at the weekend.It was a case of doubles all round for the townrsquos rugby club.The lsquoHinch won the All-Ireland League Division B title and their fourths lted the coveted Crawford Cup at the Kingspan Stadium.Just to make it a Super Saturday, Ballynahinch Hockey Club travelled down to Dublin and lted the Irish Challenge Hockey Cup for the second year in succession to complete a memorable season for Mark Brownrsquos boys.The rugby first XV dealt with St Maryrsquos College without undue trouble at Ballymacarn Park to secure their place in the top flight of Irish club rugby.Their - victory prompted huge celebrations after skipper Aaron Cairns got his hands on the trophy.ldquoThis is massive for the club, said Cairns. ldquoAll the hard work this season has finally paid off.ldquoWe wouldnrsquot have got here without our coaches, Brian McLaughlin and Tom Rock, and all the backroom staff.ldquoThere is a lot that goes on behind the scenes and without that we couldnrsquot do it.ldquoWersquove learnt lessons from our time before in A and hopefully wersquoll take that back up with us and see how we get on, added Cairns.Indeed, the trick will be staying in A somewhat longer this time around mdash lsquoHinch managed three campaigns of mostly struggle before exiting in  mdash and that fresh challenge awaits Brian McLaughlinrsquos squad.Over at Ravenhill, an experienced fourths team had just enough in the tank to defeat local rivals Banbridge thirds - to keep the Crawford Cup in the Ballymacarn Park trophy cabinet for another year.The lsquoHinch were good value for their victory in a tough, uncompromising battle, but the lsquoHinchrsquos greater experience stood them in good stead.All heads then turned towards Dublin where the hockey club faced Limerick at Serpentine Avenue in the Irish Challenge Cup final.Manager Mark Brown sent his troops out full of confidence and goals from man of the match William Edgar , Scott Leetch and Matthew Martin were good enough to give them a - victory in an entertaining final.Edgarrsquos two pieces of inidual brilliance were worthy of winning any competition in a superb display of expansive, attacking hockey.This was Ballynahinchrsquos third Irish title in seven years mdash and by far the hardest to win.The game went back and forth at breakneck speed with goals soon starting to flow.lsquoHinch, always look the more composed side with former Instonians man Matthew Martin and the predatory Edgar having that touch of class.Limerick made a real go of it in the last five minutes, but Ballynahinch had the nous to see out the game and lt the crown for a third time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Calum wins heat at Mary Peters Track  ","story":"NEWCASTLE AC juniors attended the first meet of the Firmus Fab  Series at the Mary Peters Track on Thursday night, taking part in nine events collectively.Calum Cope won his heat in the U- boysrsquo  metre race.

The current area is unkempt and I share residentsrsquo views that it is a bit of an eyesore. I am concerned that what we are looking at here is a permanent bin lorry park.Cllr Curran said that while a number of Strangford Road residents were notied by planners about the plans for the site, there was no formal consultation.

This is undoubtedly the position of Roman Catholicism.ldquoThere are many doctrinal dferences between the Church of Ireland and the Church of Rome, the fundamental dference being that they preach and believe very dferent messages and ultimately cannot be united.ldquoAs Free Presbyterians, we would like to remind both those in the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church that good works do not save an inidual, the Lord Jesus Christ alone saves.ldquoTherefore, we conclude by beseeching those in St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland who love the Lord Jesus as their Saviour to not participate in any  unity march that would grieve the True and Living God.Fr McKinlay said this was the first time in his memory that there had been a protest against the walk.ldquoI think it is a sad reflection on le in todayrsquos world that men who preach the Christian gospel do not want others to walk with them, he remarked.ldquoI feel all of this is incredulous to say the least. There have never been protests about this walk in my time and I have been in Castlewellan for ten years.Fr McKinlay praised what he described as the ldquoexcellent community relations in Castlewellan and pointed out to a number of initiatives, such an inter-church choir, the Peace Bell and Peace Maze in the local forest park and a cross-community website involving all the churches in the Castlewellan area which was set up two years ago by the International Council of Churches under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 17%2C 1979  ","story":"EASTER mdash Down District sampled the start of what could be a record year in tourism when hundreds of thousands of day-trippers thronged into the area over the sun-drenched Easter holiday period.The first unbroken spell of sunny weather this year brought motorists flocking into the area mdash and left council tourism officials confident of a summer season boom.Newcastle was one of the biggest attractions over the holiday weekend and it was Easter Tuesday thatdrew the most people as thousands crammed into the resort to see the finish of the Circuit of Ireland Rally at the Slieve Donard Hotel.Forest parks at Tollymore, Castlewellan and Drumkeeragh were also a magnet, as were National Trust properties at Castleward, Mount Stewart and Rowallane Gardens in Saintfield.There were many tailbacks of traffic in many local towns, including Dundrum, Clough, Comber and Newtownards, and there bumper-to-bumper delays in bottleneck areas like Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and Newcastle.The Strangford ferry had the busiest ever period in its ten-year history as thousands of tourists used the crossing to drive up the Ards, or, coming in the opposite way, along the Lecale coast and into Newcastle.The two ferries made a total of  crossings on Monday alone, the highest ever, and it was an applaudable effort from all their staff that things went off without a hitch.Down Councilrsquos assistant tourist and recreation officer, Mr Frank Cunningham, was optimistic that this year would break all tourism records, providing the weather was kind.ldquoWe are all very hopeful for a tremendous year and are expecting some of the biggest ever crowds to converge on our resorts and attractions, he said.DOWNPATRICK mdash The programme for the St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick in five weeksrsquo time is taking shape and promises to be a dashing four-day bill to suit all tastes.ldquoIt is far from being just another town festival of bits and pieces, said organising committee vice-chairman Frank Connolly.ldquoFrom the opening procession to the open-air carnival four nights later it will be a fast-paced programme with many unique attractions that have neverbeen seen in the area before.The festival will open on Friday, May , with a through-town procession of floats and closes four days later with the carnival in Dunleath Park where the organisers promise that virtually everything thatcan happen will happen as long as it is entertaining.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle and District Ladies Circle held a very successful third annual meeting in the Brook Cottage Hotel recently.

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

star and a former education minister are among those who have paid tribute to Portadown College principal Simon Harper who died suddenly while on holiday in Scotland.Past pupil Rory Best said he was “incredibly saddened” at the news, while Peter Weir MLA described Mr Harper as having played a “crucial role” in the Northern Ireland education system.Having taught at Rathfriland High School and Regent House in Newtownards, Mr Harper took over as principal of Portadown College in .“He played a crucial role in local education and many will join me in mourning his passing,” Mr Weir said.“I think we’d have been on a very similar page. I met him on a couple of occasions, and I think there was a strong, burning desire in his heart to preserve the best of education for all our young people.”Ulster and Ireland rugby star Rory Best tweeted: “Incredibly saddened to hear of the sudden loss of Mr Simon Harper, principal of my former school @pcportadown. Thoughts are with his family  friends.”A tribute issued on behalf of the Portadown College community said their friend and colleague was a “highly charismatic educator and leader” whose lelong passion for outdoor pursuits and Duke of Edinburgh award expeditions instilled a “love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures”.It is understood Mr Harper was on a walking holiday when he died. The cause of his death is not yet known.The school tribute added: “Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance. Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an Officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.“In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A statement issued by Rathfriland High School paid tribute to Mr Harper Simon as a man of unquestionable integrity.“Simon was a great school leader who had the needs of the pupils at the core of all he did. His integrity was unquestionable. He was true gentleman. He will be greatly missed in the field of education,” the school said.Portadown College community statement in full: On Good Friday,  April , the College Community lost not only our highly esteemed Principal with the untimely passing of Simon Harper, but a much valued colleague and dearfriend too.From attending his very first College event, the  Carol Service before officially assuming the reigns of Portadown College on  April , Simon lived out the College motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” with “Courage and Courtesy” in every aspect of his le.Already a successful and experienced Headmaster on his arrival in Portadown, Simon was a highly charismatic educator and leader. He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand.try catch  TrendingPortadown College principal dies suddenlyTribute paid to Portadown College

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ppb.jpg","title":"powered by talent making return to belfast","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business A host of top speakers will descend on Belfast in May for the second Powered by Talent event.The full day event – taking place at ICC Belfast on May  – has been signicantly expanded this year and will accommodate in excess of  attendees, making it the largest talent-focused conference on the island of Ireland and one of the highest profile events in the UK.Justin Rush, founding member of Powered By Talent and director of Abacus Talent Group, says: “Talent attraction and retention remains one of the biggest challenges businesses face.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
