Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S\u0026ampP Global, says risks of ‘stagflation’ are rising. These escalating inflationary pressures, and worries about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, hammered business optimism to its lowest since October 2020 (just before the first Covid-19 vaccine trial results). Markit’s business confidence index dropped from 76.1 in February to 71.4 in March, which is the biggest monthly drop since the start of the pandemic. Both manufacturing and services companies expect much weaker growth in the year ahead. Output across the manufacturing sector fell to a five-month low, but service sector growth hit a nine-month high, with the return to offices and customer events lifting activity this month. Overall, the Composite PMI edged down from 59.9 to 59.7, showing a slight slowdown (although rising prices will push up the PMI...).

It said aviation, marine, trade credit and political risk were the lines of business most affected. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the Lloyd’s chairman, said unrecoverable planes were likely to cause the biggest insurance losses. Moscow has passed laws to impound $10bn (£7.6bn) of jets leased to Aeroflot and other Russian airlines by western organisations. He said the next biggest losses were expected from claims related to ships trapped in the Black Sea, and to disrupted exports of cereals and agricultural products from Ukraine and Russia. Some insurance policies also cover state-sponsored cyberterrorism. Carnegie-Brown said it would take three to four weeks to work out the claims. He told the . Peter Hebblethwaite told a Commons hearing today into last week’s firings that the firm was halving its costs under a “new operating model”, where international seafarers would be paid less than minimum wage. Earlier, legal experts said P\u0026ampO should have notified their ships’ flag states in Cyprus, Bermuda and the Bahamas between 30 and 45 days in advance – rather than on the day. Hebblethwaite said the average sacked seafarer on the previous Jersey contracts was paid £36,000 per year. The replacement crew will receive an hourly rate starting at £5.15. He insisted he was “saving the business”, adding: “I would make this decision again, I’m afraid.” A majority of retailers said sales were poor for the time of year in March, according to the latest poll by the Confederation of British Industry survey. Taking are expected to remain below seasonal norms in April too, as retailers brace for a slide in spending. Martin Sartorius, Principal Economist at the CBI, says government needs to further to support the economy: The CBI’s sales-for-the-time-of-year sank to -23 from February’s +16, showing a deterioration in trading. The overall retail sales balance fell to +9 from +14 in February, a little lower than forecast. Internet sales, year-on-year, fell at the fastest rate since the survey began in 2009 -- but that comparison is distorted by the Covid-19 lockdown in 2021 when some shops were closed. The committee are aghast, and furious. Labour MP Andy McDonald compared Hebblethwaite’s attitude to driving down the motorway at 90 miles an hour because the speed limit doesn’t apply to him. McDonald also questions how P\u0026ampO can justify paying its new agency staff so little (a move that will halve its costs). More here. Darren Jones (Lab), chair of the Commons business committee, started by saying he had looked at Hebblethewaite’s CV. He asks if the company is in this mess because Hebblethewaite does not know what he is doing. Hebblethewaite starts with an apology. He says he wants to start with an apology to the seafarers affected by last week’s decision, to their families and to other employees. He says the company was losing “an unsustainable amount of money”. If the firm had not acted, it would have had to close, he says. He disputes claims heard by the committee earlier that the firm was in breach of its obligations to give sufficient notice of the sackings to the authorities where the ships are registered. Hebblethewaite says he is paid £325,000. Q: Would you take a performance related bonus if offered? Hebblethewaite says that is not something he has considered. When pressed, Hebblethewaite admits that very few people are in this category. But he says 40 people could get more than £100,000.

Photograph: PA Proposals that would see non-Irish people forced to get an electronic visa waiver before crossing the border are not yet finalised as far as the Government is conerned, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Speaking following talks with Northern secretary Brandon Lewis in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said the proposals were still in the legislative process in the UK and that Ireland would continue making representations on the issue.“I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet, there was a vote in the House of Commons last night but my understanding is this is likely to go back to the Lords and back to the Commons again,” he said.“What we have looked for here is an exemption for any non-Irish or British nationals who are resident in Ireland to be able to cross without having to get an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation), but as I say, that’s an ongoing conversation and as far as we’re concerned, that legislative process hasn’t concluded yet.”MPs at Westminster on Tuesday night voted to reinstate the requirement of a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of the proposed regime. The British government challenged an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation. Mr Coveney – who met Mr Lewis under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin – said on Tuesday night following the Commons’ vote that the Irish position had been “ignored”.He said that since the peace process was agreed, the relationship between North and South “has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people and we think that’s worth protecting”. “Northern Ireland, and the island of Ireland in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements,” he said, adding that it was “not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatment to try to protect that relationship”. Mr Lewis said the decision to move ahead with the ETA legislation had nothing to do with reported concerns in the British government about whether Ukrainian refugees could cross into the UK. The plan had been in development for years and was “completely separate” to the Ukraine crisis, he said. The measure could affect as many as 645,000 non-Irish nationals living in the Republic - almost 13 per cent of the population, which will increase again with the arrival of Ukrainians fleeing the invasion by Russia. Sinn Féin reactionSpeaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposal would create “a disgraceful situation” which undermined the Belfast Agreement and Common Travel Area. “It creates significant restrictions on freedom of movement across our island,” she said. Ms McDonald said she found it “wholly unacceptable” for a Polish person who lived and worked in Lifford, Co Donegal, would need papers to travel to Strabane, Co Tyrone, and that this was the reality “or so many people living in our Border region”. She urged the Taoiseach to intervene with British prime minister Boris Johnson and “to call this out”. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the Government stood “foursquare behind the Common Travel Area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. “We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from another member state versus Irish citizens for example going over and across the Border.”The SDLP’s Lilian Seenoi-Barr, the only elected councillor in the North from a minority ethnic background, said Westminster’s Nationalities and Borders Bill will lead to more “racial profiling” and stigmatizing of minorities. “It is a racist bill,” she said. “It will strengthen the invisible hard border that already exists for non-Irish and non British citizens.”Ms Seenoi-Barr, a former asylum seeker from Kenya, added: “People like myself, who are black and brown, will be suspect communities. We will be asked to prove that we have the right to be on this island. How else can you tell if someone is Irish or British?” SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said the proposed legislation would be “hugely disruptive” for non-Irish or UK citizens living on the island, while damaging the North’s tourism industry. “This is a terrible piece of legislation overall, with a horrible approach to refugee and asylum issues,” she said, adding that it went “against the spirit” of the Common Travel Area. Troubles’ amnestyRegarding Westminster’s proposed amnesty for Troubles-era legacy crimes, mooted last year in the face of a backlash from victims groups and others, Mr Lewis said the move had not proceeded because the government wanted to consult with parties and civil society bodies in Northern Ireland. “We want to bring something forward that helps people of Northern Ireland get to the truth and get information,” he said, adding that he would not put a timeframe on that. Mr Coveney said the issue could not be forgotten “because the current status quo in terms of getting the truth and securing prosecutions and so on isn’t as it should be for many families and victims groups”. He said the Irish Government’s position was that the strictures of the Stormont House agreement on legacy cases was the agreed position. However, he added: “We also have accepted that if some want to move in a different direction, we’ll listen to those arguments and see if we can agree in places to move forward. We’re still very open to that engagement and partnership.”On comparisons drawn by British prime minister Boris Johnson between the Brexit vote and the Ukranian resistance to Russia’s invasion, Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had clarified them and that his spokespeople had recognised “that’s not a good comparison to have in the same sentence”.A joint communique issued by the ministers after the meeting said they had discussed the development of the British-Irish relationship in the coming years, including “potential synergies” between the UK’s levelling up plan and Ireland’s National Development Plan. It noted “with regret” the developments at Stormont since it last met in December and reiterated commitments from both governments to the functioning of the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre.

You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there.

Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"flexibility on eu vat rules sought to ease energy prices rises varakdar says","story":"The Government is looking for “more flexibility” in EU rules on VAT in order to alleviate energy price rises, the Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said in Brussels today.He said that EU leaders would discuss the possibility to relaxing the rules so that it could reduce Vat without having to introduce a higher rate in the future.Mr Varadkar said that under current EU rules, if the Government reduced VAT on fuel temporarily, it would have to eventually put VAT back up to a higher rate. “So we’re looking for a bit more flexibility on that,” he said.Mr Varadkar was speaking to the media in advance of a meeting of European People’s Party (EPP) leaders, the centre right group to which Fine Gael is affiliated, before today’s summit of EU leaders in Brussels.“We do anticipate there will be a fifth package of sanctions, possibly involving some energy actions against Russia,” Mr Varadkar said. “And obviously we need to see what else we can do to support Ukraine, both in it military response and also humanitarianly as well.”“There’s been four sanctions package already and the fifth one may include listing some more people linked to the Putin government, and may involve energy measures as well, perhaps around not buying Russian oil and coal. But that can be a difficulty for some European countries that are dependent on energy from Russia in a way that Ireland is not.”“And we need to bear in mind when imposing sanctions that any sanctions need to do more harm to Russia than to us.”He said the fifth package could be done on Friday, but it could also be agreed later.Mr Varadkar said that the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and the Minister for Defence Simon Coveney had advised that the Irish army did not have weapons that it could send to help the Ukrainian army. He said that anti-tank weapons help by the Defence Forces were needed for “training and peacekeeping”. But he stressed that Ireland was contributing fully to EU financial support for Ukraine, and Irish funds were being used to buy supplies for the Ukrainian army, including “fuel and rations and body armour”. “They mightn’t be weapons but they do make a difference. You know an army marches on its stomach and they need armour and they need fuel and we’re providing that.Asked if this was military assistance, Mr Varadkar said: “Technically, it’s not. It’s considered to be non-lethal assistance . . . But to me it is largely a technicality.”Mr Varadkar said the Government was concerned about food security, but he did not anticipate that there would be “food shortages or rationing . . . That isn’t something that we anticipate, because we do produce so much food as a country. What may happen is that there will be less choice - that some products that are currently available may not be and I think we will see increases in the price of food.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

Photograph: Alan BetsonApplications for passports are “off the charts” with record numbers in the last three months, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Mr Coveney said there were 137,000 applications to the Passport Service in January, more than 150,000 in February and more than 100,000 already in March.He was responding to Limerick TD Richard O’Donoghue in the Dáil on Thursday who said delays with passport applications were leading to “stress and anxiety” for people.“The main issue that’s driving pressure at the moment is just the sheer volume of applications, it’s just off the charts in terms of anything else we’ve ever experienced in recent years,” Mr Coveney said. “We’ve had three months in a row now of record application numbers, as in the highest ever.”Mr Coveney said there had never previously been more than 100,000 applications in a month.He said straightforward adult passport renewals were working reasonably well but it was different for more complicated cases.PhonelineMr Coveney said a system that could allow Oireachtas members to intervene when necessary was needed.“This phoneline responded to over 2,700 queries in 2021, and it has already handled over 3,600 queries to date in 2022.”He said there has been “very high volumes this week” and he acknowledged the wait time on phonelines has been “longer than normal”.The Minister said 38,000 applications were “stuck in the system” as they were awaiting the applicant to provide further information. Mr Coveney also acknowledged that the term Passport Express service was “a bit of a misnomer”.“It is not an express service. It’s a much slower service. It’s a paper-based service based on post, and that is certainly an outdated marketing term. We are looking to move away from that terminology of Passport Express to replace it with something else whether it’s ‘Passport in the Post’, or whatever,” he said.Mr Coveney said more than 770 staff were working in the Passport Office, up from 450 last summer. He said this figure would rise to about 900 within the next six weeks, adding that the number of staff would have effectively doubled within the last eight months.He said: “Ultimately we want to get to a point where everybody applies online.” Mr Coveney said more than 90 per cent of applications for passports were already online but that needed to get to 100 per cent as it was a much “cleaner, transparent, safer and faster system”."},{"url":null,"title":"sierra leonean students tackle lgbt rights and feminism through theatre","story":"Rehearsals for The Throne, the first live theatre performance in Sierra Leone in decades. Photograph: Sally HaydenThey cast three people in each role, on the assumption that two would drop out before the final performance, and rehearsed most nights on an old basketball court in a girls’ secondary school, without overhead lights. For the University of Sierra Leone Theatre Group, the show would go on.“Can’t miss this play redefining the views about gender, sexual orientation and power in Africa, ” read the advertisement for The Throne, which was performed for the first time to hundreds of people at Freetown’s City Hall in February and promoted as the “rebirth of theatre in Sierra Leone”.Some said it was the first live theatre performance in decades. A cast of about 30 rehearsed for months, contributing some of their own money to buy costumes and construct the set, and the final show included dancing, singing and drumming.It was sold out, leading to a second performance. Now, the cast is going on the road for a third, in the city of Makeni, in the west African coastal country’s north.“It is a big deal,” says Sarafina Nicolsesay, a 22-year-old mass communication graduate and the play’s narrator. “I think the culture has died for a long time . . . In Sierra Leone one of the struggles that we’ve had with marketing this event is most people are not interested in theatre.”Nicolsesay fell in love with acting as a child, listening to satirical radio programmes, and later began to watch shows such as Hamilton on YouTube. To join the theatre group, she had to ignore criticism from her mother, who saw acting as a waste of time because it wouldn’t earn her decent money. Staying involved has been an uphill battle.Many of the cast and crew were born during or since Sierra Leone’s civil war, which devastated the country in the 1990s and early 2000s. It again suffered through the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak and the Covid-19 pandemic. Local cultural activities – particularly theatre – have been a casualty, those involved in The Throne say, as many Sierra Leoneans haven’t learned to value them.Nicolsesay doesn’t know of a single functional theatre in her home country, but she hopes an industry can begin to develop. “Entertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,” she says, with clear enthusiasm.The plot of The Throne, written by Sierra Leonean writer Oumar Farouk Sesay, follows the demise of the king of the village of Norkorba. The only two people in the line of succession are his son – a married gay man who lives in the diaspora – or his daughter, who, as a woman, challenges the patriarchal structures that prop up the monarchy.“It’s going to be a culture shock to a lot of people, especially the part about the gay characters,” Nicolsesay says in advance of the opening performance. “The first time I heard the synopsis of it, I was like, Are you sure this is going to be cool, because we don’t have people who are out and proud in this country,” she says. “But that’s what we’re trying to show . . . you’re trying to get people to understand a certain type of subject that is taboo.”Homosexuality between men is illegal in Sierra Leone, and can, in theory, be punished with life imprisonment, though this has not been recently enforced.Nicolsesay says she hopes the play will start a conversation about feminism as well. “Women are always trying to go for leadership roles and they’ve been shut down, they’re always demoralised, and so that’s something that unfolds in the play as well.” Both topics are “pushing the boundaries”, she says.From October 2021, the young people rehearsed almost every night, passionate both about the story and the talent they wanted to display. “If it gets dark it doesn’t matter, we use our phone lights,” says Alvin Momoh, sitting on a bench at dusk, as he watches a full run-through. The fashion designer, who also works on a Sierra Leonean TV show called Slay Or Nay, helped organise the costumes. “Sometimes we stay late into the night.”Speaking after the first two performances, the play’s director, Bilal Jalloh, says there has been no negative reaction. “They love what we did,” he says, though “some people choose to reserve their opinions” on the plot.Martin Simah Jnr (23), who played the king’s gay son, says he did not invite friends and family to attend the initial performances because he was worried about their reaction. But he had his own revelation, finding the experience “wowing”. Performing the role helped him to understand both the discrimination same-sex couples face, as well as the “relevance of women in the political arena”, he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bone contention finally settled largest ever meat eating dinosaur","story":"The biggest meat-eating dinosaur to ever live, which dwarfed even the mighty T-Rex, was a river monster that ate car-sized fish, a study has found.Spinosaurus had a crocodile-like snout, measured around 50ft long, had stubby hind legs and a powerful tail. But there has been fierce debate over whether it was a genuine water-dweller or if it was a wader, plucking fish out the water like a grizzly bear does salmon.Analysis of fossilised remains show the dinosaur had extremely dense bones, similar to penguins and other aquatic animals, which the researchers claim prove it lived in water.“It was not a wader, or a heron-like animal, it was an animal that spent a lot of time submerged in the water,” Dr Nizar Ibrahim, the study author and a palaeontologist at the University of Portsmouth, told The .“The bones don\u0027t lie, density is a telltale sign of animals that spend an awful amount of time in the water.“The cool thing about dinosaurs is they are bizarre and alien-looking. People seek to find a modern day equivalent, but spinosaurus just don\u0027t have one.If you thought the monster shark in Jaws was scary, think again. The Spinosaurus was a real river monster.”Dr Ibrahim is convinced this finding, published in Nature, puts to bed any debate over whether the biggest dinosaur predator was terrestrial or marine-based. “If this doesn’t settle the debate, I’m not sure what else could possibly do it, except finding a fossil in a snorkelling kit,” he added.The fossils were found in the Sahara desert, as in the era of the dinosaurs it was not a barren wasteland, but a vast river network.“Spinosaurus lived in a giant river system with car-sized fish that ned the Sahara, from Egypt to Morocco. I call it the River of Giants,” said Dr Ibrahim.“It was the most dangerous place in the history of planet Earth.”He added that there were so many apex predators on the surface, that Spinosaurus managed to become the biggest by taking to the water and dominating the rivers.It is hard to date the dinosaur accurately by virtue of scarce remains, but the team believe they lived around 100 million years ago and may have gone extinct when a bout of global warming saw sea levels rise and the lake system become drowned by sea water, killing off the freshwater fish and, subsequently, Spinosaurus themselves.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin labels Boris Johnson the \u0026#39most active anti-Russian leader\u0026#39Latest pictures from Ukraine: Zelensky accuses Russia of unleashing phosphorus bombsPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak defends Spring Statement and says he‘Vulnerable to climate change in every way’: Mumbai eyes status as Asia’s first zero carbon cityWatch: Ukrainians claim to have destroyed Russian Navy landing ship after Kremlin gave away its locationBritain could become a tidal energy superpowerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont exercise outside says sadiq khan londons high pollution","story":"Londoners have been warned to limit their exercise outside as warm weather brings clouds of pollution from the continent.As temperatures reached 20C in the capital on Wednesday, older people and those with heart and lung problems were told to limit “strenuous physical exertion” due to high pollution levels.Anyone else “suffering discomfort” should also consider reducing their activity, official advice said.A forecast from Imperial College London said that levels of fine particulate pollution, or PM2.5, would reach “high” levels on Wednesday and Thursday, causing health problems for vulnerable people.The alert was the first issued by the Met Office since August 2020. Alerts were also broadcast in London train stations and to travellers at bus stops around the capital.Despite the health warning, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, also urged people to walk or cycle to limit the air pollution from vehicles.Government data from around the country shows that high pollution levels were also recorded in Yorkshire, including Leeds and Sheffield, and in Kent and Sunderland.The poor air quality is being caused by an area of high pressure which is pulling air carrying particles from the continent towards the UK, and also creating still conditions, meaning local air pollution is not being dispersed.The pollution risk will continue on Thursday with parts of the south east forecast to see “very high” levels, particularly in Essex and Norfolk, data from Defra and the Met Office show. At very high levels, everyone is advised to reduce outdoor exercise.The high pressure and resulting lack of cloud and wind is also leading to sunny, warm weather.Wednesday was the warmest day of the year so far, with a high of 20.8C recorded in St James\u0027s Park, London.Sarah Kent, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “We\u0027ve got high pressure across the country and across the south eastern corner of the UK that\u0027s drawing in a southeasterly breeze. It\u0027s very, very light, but it is drawing in continental air. There\u0027s often extra particulates tied in with that.“The other issue with high pressure is that because the wind is so light, the pollution we produce on a daily basis in our cities is not being dispersed, it\u0027s just sitting there.”Warm weather will continue into the weekend, though Tuesday and Wednesday are likely to be the warmest days this week, with colder weather predicted from Monday, she added.Gardeners could still expect to see some ground frost in the coming days and the north of Scotland will also experience patchy rain and cloud.The European pollution comes in part from farmers on the continent ploughing or spraying, the Met Office said.“High” pollution levels mean that the concentration of PM2.5 is between 54 and 70 micrograms per cubic metre as an average over the day.PM2.5 is one of the most dangerous forms of air pollution, and has been linked to asthma, heart and lung problems and cancers.In the short term it can exacerbate symptoms for people who have health problems linked to breathing.“Adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors, and particularly if they experience symptoms,” official Government advice says, adding that older people should also reduce physical exertion.Anyone else who is “experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors,” it adds.Mr Khan said: “I’m urging Londoners to look after each other by choosing to walk, cycle or take public transport, avoiding unnecessary car journeys, stopping engine idling and not burning wood or garden waste, all of which contributes to high levels of pollution.“This is particularly important in order to protect those who are more vulnerable to high pollution.“While this alert is in place people with heart and lung problems should avoid physical exertion.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin labels Boris Johnson the \u0026#39most active anti-Russian leader\u0026#39Latest pictures from Ukraine: Zelensky accuses Russia of unleashing phosphorus bombsPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak defends Spring Statement and says he‘Vulnerable to climate change in every way’: Mumbai eyes status as Asia’s first zero carbon cityWatch: Ukrainians claim to have destroyed Russian Navy landing ship after Kremlin gave away its locationBritain could become a tidal energy superpowerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"secret life alina kabaeva star gymnast became putins eva braun","story":"Beautiful, talented and with an Olympic gold medal to her name, Alina Kabaeva was once regarded as the most eligible woman in Moscow. Today, though, she has a rather less desirable epithet, as “Russia’s Eva Braun”.Kabaeva, 38, is the former gymnast turned politician who is widely believed to be the girlfriend, or possibly the wife, of Vladimir Putin. She is even rumoured to have given birth to four children by the Russian president, though reports of any relationship between the two have always been denied by the Kremlin.As Putin commits ever greater atrocities in Ukraine, Kabaeva and her children are reportedly holed up in a Swiss chalet, facing growing demands to be extradited back to Russia.“It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer,” says a Change.org petition to the Swiss government signed by almost 64,000 people at the time of writing, comparing her to the woman who married Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker the day before they both took their own lives.Opponents of Putin believe Kabaeva is in hiding near Lugano, a quiet lakeside city known for its celebrated chocolate museum, though there is no proof she is even in Switzerland. Other reports place her in an underground bunker in Siberia’s Altai Mountains.Needless to say, facts about Putin’s private life are hard to pin down. One thing we do know is that the 69-year-old dictator is orced from his first wife, Lyudmila Shkrebneva, which was confirmed in 2014, six years after Kabaeva was first romantically linked with Putin.“I have a private life in which I do not permit interference,” Putin has said. “It must be respected.” He has also criticised “those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into other people’s lives”.This, though, has done little to quell the rumours, according to which Kabaeva continues to be Russia’s secret first lady, paid a £7.7 million salary for her job controlling a pro-Kremlin media group.Dr Elisabeth Schimpfössl, a senior lecturer at Aston University and author of Rich Russians: From Oligarchs to Bourgeoisie, says she has heard rumours that “Vladimir Putin and Alina live together in the Kremlin”. There are plenty of clues that point to a long-term relationship between the two, and to the origins of Putin’s interest in her, dating back to at least 2008 and possibly much earlier.Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 1983, Kabaeva’s father was a professional footballer and her mother played basketball for the national side, but she is said to have left her roots firmly in the past once success came her way. Kabaeva is said to have started rhythmic gymnastics at the age of five, and her parents took her to Moscow where she was taken under the wing of Irina Viner, a former Soviet-era coach.By the age of 13 she was competing for Russia, and she went on to win 14 world championship medals, 21 European championship medals and Olympic gold at the 2004 Athens Games. A doping conviction in 2001 saw her stripped of the world title she had won that year.The source who knew her when she was in her early 20s said she lived at the time in a “modest and quite Soviet” flat near the Central Moscow Hippodrome, decorated with small glass ornaments, and described her as “a sweet girl – simple, nice and friendly”. She seemed to want companionship more than anything. “I think she’d been put in that flat and it was quite new that she was living on her own, rather than living with her mother, who was pretty involved,” says the source.At the time, Kabaeva had a boyfriend, a Moscow-based policeman originally from Georgia, who “overnight became a colonel and got promoted wildly up the ranks”, says the source. “She talked to me about him and looked quite proud.”Her confidence clearly grew in line with her success as a gymnast. She became so popular that a Russian pop band recorded a song about her entitled Alina. Nor was she particularly modest about her talents. “Being a star in gymnastics is not just about skill,” she told one interviewer, “It is also about personality. Look at me. I don’t want to be rude, but everyone wants to be like Alina Kabaeva.”Dr Schimpfössl says it was through sport rather than politics that Kabaeva met Putin. Viner, who married the oligarch Alisher Usmanov, introduced them, she says. In 2001, Putin was pictured beside Kabaeva as he awarded her an Order of Friendship (a state decoration) at the Kremlin.Kabaeva’s relationship with the Georgian policeman reportedly ended in 2005 amid complaints of tabloid intrusion into her life. She is on record as saying subsequently she had met a man who “I love very much”, adding: “Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared.” Described as Russia’s most flexible woman, she retired from gymnastics after 2004, but made a brief comeback in 2007, by which time her sights were firmly set on politics. It was in that year that Kabaeva was elected to the State Duma, representing the pro-Putin United Russia party.The source next saw her in 2008, by which point Kabaeva’s life appeared to have changed dramatically. The source was attending an awards ceremony in Russia, where Putin himself was present. “We had a massive formal dinner and afterwards I looked over and saw this girl in a white Grecian dress and realised, ‘Oh my God, it’s Alina,” she says.She was shocked by how much weight Kabaeva had gained, but a fellow guest told her, “Well, she’s pregnant.” He also told her Kabaeva was in a relationship with Putin.  The source witnessed no physical interaction between the gymnast and Putin that evening, but she noticed the attention Kabaeva was attracting from others: “There was a circle of people staring at her as she twirled around.” Her career had branched into modelling and hosting a television chat show called Steps to Success, and in 2014 she announced she was quitting parliament to take control of the pro-Kremlin National Media Group. In November last year, The Insider, a Russian investigative journalism website, reported she was paid an annual salary of 785 million roubles (£7.7 million), basing the figure on leaked tax records for 2018.She is reported to have been seen wearing a wedding ring and there have been claims she and Putin married in the Iversky Monastery in the Valdai hills between Moscow and St Petersburg.Rumour has it that she gave birth to a son by Putin, named Dima after one of the president’s close friends, followed by a daughter and then twins, all of whom are said to have Swiss passports. In 2015, Switzerland’s Bick tabloid reported Putin had flown to Switzerland to be with Kabaeva as she went into labour at the private Clinic Sant’Anna near Lugano, although Putin’s spokesman insisted that “information about the birth of a baby fathered by Vladimir Putin does not correspond to reality”. The twins are said to have been born in 2018, after which Kabaeva disappeared from public view for almost three years.She resurfaced last August, appearing on a state television channel to criticise Tokyo judges who deprived Russian star Dina Averina of gold in rhythmic gymnastics.In December, as tension between Russia and Ukraine ramped up, it was reported she was seen dancing at a party in Moscow’s Voskhod restaurant, not far from the Kremlin, resplendent in a glittering gold dress. The party followed an experimental rhythmic gymnastics international tournament called Divine Grace, which she herself had organised.In keeping with the status that she would command as Putin’s wife, she reportedly has a fleet of limousines at her disposal and has made visits to a Moscow café surrounded by security guards armed with machine guns.If she has indeed decamped to Switzerland lately, it is unclear how long she might remain. “Please decide whether the residence of this inidual in your country is warranted,” implores the petition to the Swiss government. “It’s time Switzerland takes action.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin labels Boris Johnson the \u0026#39most active anti-Russian leader\u0026#39Latest pictures from Ukraine: Zelensky accuses Russia of unleashing phosphorus bombsPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak defends Spring Statement and says he‘Vulnerable to climate change in every way’: Mumbai eyes status as Asia’s first zero carbon cityWatch: Ukrainians claim to have destroyed Russian Navy landing ship after Kremlin gave away its locationBritain could become a tidal energy superpowerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tories dont deserve survive keep treating voters like fools","story":"It is the first lesson of politics: don’t take your voters for fools. Don’t pretend to cut taxes when you are raising them. Don’t claim you are prioritising collapsing living standards when you are not.The cost of living crisis is a global phenomenon, and the ability of politicians to counteract it is limited in the short term. But the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, still had a choice: he could have pledged not to make this inflationary tornado any worse. He could have ditched his manifesto-breaking National Insurance increase. He could have removed some of the taxes pushing up gas and electricity prices. He could have announced a review into the Bank of England’s inflation-targeting performance.He chose instead to push ahead with most of his tax increases, clinging to an obsolete orthodoxy that directly adds to the cost of living crisis, while desperately seeking to camouflage the true nature of his actions. When he did act, it was by helping workers on lower incomes, loading even more of the burden onto the Conservative Party’s electoral base.He decided to prioritise the ersatz version of conservatism he has felt he needed to make his own: a high-spending, high-taxing, debt-reducing, budget-balancing model of the economy, accompanied by inducements for firms to invest and train more to boost productivity. The debt to GDP ratio is predicted to fall from 95.6 per cent of GDP this year to 83.1 per cent by 2026-27 despite Covid: it is that, bizarrely, which Sunak appears to believe will be his legacy.Yet the Chancellor, hemmed in by Boris Johnson’s social democratic vision for Britain, has made the wrong call, with disastrous consequences for his party – and his own career. Because Johnson didn’t allow him to be a small-state conservative, Sunak reinvented himself as a low-debt Tory. He was right to predict that debt interest costs would surge – by four times, it turned out. But fiscal conservatism isn’t morally, economically or electorally equivalent to low-tax conservatism. It isn’t the real deal.Abstract aggregates such as GDP don’t matter to voters: what counts is whether they are better or worse off in terms of purchasing power. On that metric, the year ahead will be the worst anybody can remember. It will be catastrophic, appalling, and could destroy the Conservative Party and its reputation for economic competence for a generation.Real household disposable income will fall by 2.2 per cent, the greatest drop in living standards in any year since records began in 1956-57. The hit is worse than during the IMF bailout of the 1970s, worse than after the ERM crisis, 911, Lehman Brothers, and (thanks to massive intervention) worse even than Covid.That is the backdrop to Sunak’s decision not to cancel the NIC rise. He needed to do far more to show that he was taking the public’s pain – including Middle England’s – seriously. What is the point of a lower national debt if it gets Labour elected, who then finish off what is left of the economy and borrow more anyway?Sunak never set off to do this, but his role as Johnson’s CFO has made him responsible for helping complete Britain’s transition to a low-growth, high tax economy. The numbers are horrifying.Even after Sunak’s modest, performative tax relief, the tax to GDP ratio will have increased by 3.3 percentage points of GDP by 2025-6 compared with 2019-20. The overall tax burden will surge from 33 per cent of GDP to 36.3 per cent, the highest since Clement Attlee’s hard-Left administration in the 1940s. Public spending will have increased by 2.1 per cent of GDP, to levels last reached sustainably in the 1970s. This is what a technocratic Labour government would do, minus the wealth taxes and the class warfare. Sunak’s smoke and mirrors performance wasn’t especially elaborate. The increase in the personal allowance cancels out only a third of the rise in National Insurance contributions. In total, the Spring Statement offset just a sixth of the tax hikes previously introduced by Sunak, dropping to a tenth without the hypothetical 1p cut to income tax that may or may not happen in 2024. This particular move is the least generous income tax reduction that it is possible to make: it would reduce the tax burden by 0.2 per cent of GDP, far less than the sums raised by freezing the personal allowance. By contrast, Nigel Lawson slashed the top rate of tax by 20 percentage points: that is what real Tory Budgets look like.Even at a time of maximum pain, green fundamentalism remains de rigeur. The Treasury maintains it would be wrong to cut VAT on fuel to zero, a Brexit promise originally made by Johnson, because it would make the tax system more complex. Instead, it suddenly decided that it was in fact possible to cut VAT to zero – but only on insulation, heat pumps and solar panels. Like Milton Friedman, I never say no to a tax cut, but the cant is breathtaking. The fuel duty tax cut was great, but oversold in a way that would have made Gordon Brown blush – the Chancellor claimed that it would save taxpayers £5 billion but the real figure is £2.4 billion.I remain very fond of Sunak, a brilliant and substantial figure. He is an unwilling social democrat, taken hostage by a neo-Heseltinian Prime Minister. I hope he will eventually be able to be himself again. His decision to align the National Insurance and income tax personal allowances is a great piece of tax simplification. He valiantly resisted numerous bad ideas. He didn’t increase Universal Credit. He did not increase spending on public services despite the rise in inflation, ensuring a large real terms cut. It may be by stealth, but this is the kind of diet our bloated state must immediately be put on.Yet Sunak made a terrible mistake by not scrapping his NIC hike, and an even worse one by defying Boris Johnson when the PM was at his weakest, forcing him to stick to this daft, destructive policy. He was reduced to spending his Spring Statement tinkering and tweaking. What’s the point of hiking NICs and then cutting income tax?It is likely that the voters will turn on the Tories as the cost of living crisis intensifies.

It is an even stronger candidate than he might have realised, holding out the promise not only of increasing our energy independence but also levelling up. A group of scientists and engineers has shown how we could generate electricity using tidal energy that does not require the building of a costly lagoon, like the cancelled scheme for Swansea Bay.Schemes based on using tidal river basins would increase energy security, reduce reliance on authoritarian dictatorships, increase levelling up, and (unlike other renewables) require no government subsidy. Moreover, unlike wind and solar, there is no intermittency problem and electricity is generated round the clock every day of the year.A considerable amount of electricity could be generated on derelict, brownfield sites that lie adjacent to the major industrial rivers in the UK. They are former shipyards, chemical works, salt pans, wharves and ironworks that have been abandoned.In essence the plan involves taking over a derelict riverside site, near the sea (to use the full tidal range) but far enough inland to avoid sea storms. A simple concrete and steel construction, like a dry dock, is all that’s required. Turbines work between the river and the excavated basin, which is subided into chambers with turbines in the iding walls. When the tide comes in, through the turbines, it makes electricity and when it goes out, it also passes through turbines to make electricity. Some water is held back in the chambers to keep generating while the tide is turning.Housing could be built on the roof of the basin and sold to help recover capital costs. The sites could also be used as a base for frozen food factories. The frozen food industry is a very heavy user of electricity but siting a large operating plant over a tidal basin would enable the turnover of cold tidal water to act as the cooling reservoir and take a considerable load off the grid.An even heavier user of electricity is the data storage industry. The amount of power used to cool enormous memory banks is huge. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook, as well as the NHS, are all concerned about the cost of keeping vast computer facilities cool. This burden could be taken off the grid by transferring it to the cold water circulating in the tidal basin. Green hydrogen could also be manufactured by electrolysis using on-site electricity when not required by the national grid.About 40 potential sites have been identified. The most promising are on the Tyne (former dry docks), at the Forth (former salt pans), the Tees (former ICI works), the Orwell (another former ICI site), and Swansea (a former BP chemical works and a former steelworks). Each would be capable of generating around 400MW.The opportunity for inward investment is huge and no government subsidy is required, unlike schemes for large-scale nuclear plants. Reliable income streams would come from selling the electricity, using the water for cooling, and selling green hydrogen.If we want both energy independence and levelling-up, then generating electricity in tidal river basins looks like the next big idea.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin labels Boris Johnson the \u0026#39most active anti-Russian leader\u0026#39Latest pictures from Ukraine: Zelensky accuses Russia of unleashing phosphorus bombsPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak defends Spring Statement and says he‘Vulnerable to climate change in every way’: Mumbai eyes status as Asia’s first zero carbon cityWatch: Ukrainians claim to have destroyed Russian Navy landing ship after Kremlin gave away its locationConsumers complain of being \u0026#39ripped off\u0026#39 as 5p fuel duty cut doesn\u0026#39t appear at some pumpsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"12 nasty details hidden small","story":" nasty details hidden in the small print of Rishi Sunaks tax-cutting Spring StatementRishi Sunak today trumpeted fuel duty cuts and a change to National Insurance tax thresholds in his Spring Statement .

That’s despite Brits facing the worst cost-of-living shock since records began nearly YEARSago as inflation rockets to .% this year - and could peak at nearly % thanks to the Ukraine-Russia war. In a bombshell aposrabbit out of the hatapos, he promised to cut the basic rate of income tax from p to p in the pound - but not now, only in April  in an election bribe. With Iceland’s boss today saying food bank users are “declining potatoes and root veg because they canapost afford the energy to boil them”, are today’s announcements enough to stop us hitting the iceberg  You won’t be surprised that an avalanche of campaigners are telling us - no.  And even the great achievements the Chancellor has announced have some pretty unpleasant small print behind them.From the awkward truth about the fuel duty cut to the impact on Universal Credit claimants who face a cost-of-living disaster, we round up some of the small print Rishi Sunak doesn’t want you to see. Fuel duty cut will save you just £. a month -you driveFuel duty will be cut by p a litre from pm tonight until March . The Chancellor said itaposs the biggest cut ever and Treasury boasted it will save the average van driver around £ this year - or £, for the average haulier.But it will only knock £ off the cost of a -litre tank for a family car. The Resolution Foundation said it’ll save the typical driving household only £ a year. And evengarages pass it on in full, it will only reverse % of the rise in pump prices over the last year. Petrol prices have gone up p in seven days - so Sunak’s big tax cut takes us back to…. last week. Universal Credit claimants will see half their ‘gains’ wiped outIn his big-ticket announcement, Rishi Sunak raised the threshold at which you start paying National Insurance by £, to £,. The people who gain the most from this are people on minimum-wage jobs who earn £, a year. They’re taken out of paying NI altogether. But these people are often also on Universal Credit - and that’s a problem, because they’re are taxed dferently to other people. For every £ of extra earnings they take home after tax, p of their benefits will be “tapered” away under Universal Credit rules, giving them a p net gain. Sothey gain £ by being taken out of National Insurance, Universal Credit rules suggest they may only keep £. of that.Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis told the BBC : “By increasing the NI threshold which increases people’s net disposable income, because of the way Universal Credit works, anyone on Universal Credit will only get half the gain of the National Insurance rise. I should state I’m double checking that… but I think that is what is likely to happen.”A massive stealth hit will force .million more Brits to pay income taxThe Chancellor crowed about hiking the National Insurance threshold. But the wage where you start paying income tax - £, - is being frozen for four years from this April. That will mean a whopping .million more Brits will be dragged into paying income tax by  , as their wages cross over the £, line. Soaring inflation means twice as many people will be dragged into paying income tax compared to what the forecasters thought last year. IFS director Paul Johnson said: “The freezing of the income tax personal allowance and higher rate threshold turn out to be much bigger tax rises than first intended. “As a result, almost all workers will be paying more tax on their earnings in  than they would have been paying without this parliament’s reforms”.Poorest households gain less than richest onesThe Treasury produced a table of gains ‘since ’ to households based on income, that suggested the poorest tenth will be just over £, better off. But the Resolution Foundation warned £ in every £ of support is going to the richest half of households. The think tank said the poorest fth of households will gain just £ from todayaposs Spring Statement - compared to £ for middle earners and £ for the wealthiest. That’s because the poorest people already aren’t paying much in National Insurance or fuel duty, the two taxes that have seen a cut today. Nor are they doing things like installing solar  on their home, which also saw a tax cut.Graduates are being absolutely hammered The small print of Budget forecasts shows the long-term changes to the student loan system will net tens of billions for the Chancellor.Repayment thresholds are being frozen this April. And students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold now. Meanwhile theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . All this will save the public finances £.bn in   and an average of £.bn a year over the following years, the OBR revealed. For context, that compares to £.bn a yearthat Brits will gain once income tax is cut from p to p in the pound from April .Benefits will lose £bn in value… while Sunak tops up by £mRishi Sunak announced he was doubling the Household Support Fund for councils to help Brits in dire straits, from £m to £bn. Yet that’s left in the shade by a £BILLION fall in the real value of benefits in -, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. This is because benefits are rising at just .% while inflation is expected to top out at .% in the last three months of this year. The way benefits are calculated suggests that’ll trigger a bumper rise in April , but that’s cold comfort to claimants now. The OBR wanted it will take benefits “up to  months to catch up fully with higher inflation”. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year.But is there still more cash to hunt benefit fraudsters than tax dodgers Two paragraphs next to each other in the Spring Statement small print may raise eyebrows. Paragraph . promises £m over the next five years to “increase compliance and debt management capacity” in HM Revenue and Customs. Paragraph . restates a pledge for £m to “increase DWP’s capacity and capability to detect fraud and error, and collect more debt”. It comes after benefit fraud and error exploded in Covid times and it’s set to recover £.bn. But many will be worried about the focus on benefits as opposed to tax dodgers.Savings are set to plunge to a record lowThe hike in interest rates should - in theory - help you get a betteron savings. But you need savings in the first place for that. Household savings could hit a record low in  as families are forced to delve into their reserves as the cost of living crisis hits, the OBR said. The watchdog predicted that the saving ratio will drop to .% by the start of  as inflation eats into wages. The household saving ratio reached a record high of nearly % during lockdown early in the pandemic, with families saving around £bn more between the start of  and the latter half of , than in the comparable period before Covid hit. The OBR said the new era of austerity would mean households dip into their savings are are less able to put cash aside.Bulb Energy bailout to cost taxpayers almost £bnWhen Bulb Energy - which has .m customers - last year faced going into administration, the Government stepped in with a £.bn bailout. Ministers at the time described the cash as a loan but the fiscal watchdog today confirms the bailout will in fact cost the taxpayer more than £bn. The OBR says: The government’s bailout of Bulb Energy incurs a £.bn cost in - and a further £bn in -, to cover the company’s operating losses. Given the volatility in global energy markets, there remains uncertainty around the final cost.Departmental budgets take a battering from inflation tooSpiking inflation also has a crippling knock-on effect for the government cash available for public services. Rishi Sunak confirmed the governmentaposs departmental budgets - which covered everything from the Ministry of Justice to councils to transport - in his spending review last year in cash terms. But due to inflation those budgets have now shrunk.The OBR predicts that there is now between £bn and £bn less in resources available for services - and that the NHS accounts for around a quarter of that. Today’s help wipes out just a fraction of tax risesRishi Sunak boasted he’d become the tax-cutting Chancellor before the next election, but only just. The OBR watchdog found all the previously announced tax rises will add .% of GDP to the tax burden - already the highest in decades - by  . The freeze on fuel duty, change to National Insurance and p income tax cut in  will lower that tax burden by just .%. Brexit red tape is hurting trade Hidden in the small print of the OBR report is the revelation that Brexit red tape still appears to be hitting Britainaposs trade.The OBR said that the UK saw a similar collapse in exports as other countries at the start of the pandemic - but was missing out as global trading levels began to recover at the end of . It adds: The UK appears to have become a less trade-intensive economy, with trade as a share of GDP falling % since , two and a half times more than in any other G country.

Mr Sunak raises his bank card to try and pay using the barcode scanner through the plastic screen not realising it isnapost a card machine.The gaffe was aired on Sky News last night as it emerged that the Chancellor had posed for pictures promoting the Treasuryaposs temporary fuel duty cut using someone aposs car. The millionaire Chancellor arranged a photo opportunity at a Sainsburyaposs forecourt filling up a Kia Rio - worth about £, - and paying for the petrol himself. The Cabinet minister, who had a small mic clipped to his tie for the publicity shots, was roundly mocked on social media as pretending to be a man of the people while Brits brace for the biggest fall in living standards since records began in the s.  And it is now understood that the family car he was filling up did not even belong to the Cabinet minister and was that of a Sainsburyaposs worker. It comes after Mr Sunak delivered his Spring Statement to the House of Commons as millions of Brits struggle with the cost of living crisis. Yesterday, Mr Sunak confirmed a p-a-litre cut to fuel duty as part of his Spring Statement.Experts have called for more action from the Chancellor after petrol prices hit record highs. The cut in fuel duty means the rate will be reduced to .p for both petrol and diesel from pm yesterday until March next year. The current rate is .p per litre. Fuel duty is included in the price drivers pay at the pumps, with VAT at % charged on top of the total price. The Treasury boasted the fuel duty cut, along with a freeze already planned, will save the average van driver around £ this year - or £, for the average haulier.  Motoring experts at the RAC suggest the cut to fuel duty will save drivers just £ off the cost of filling a -litre family car.Yesterday, Mr Sunak boasted he was unveiling £.bn of help to support Brits with the biggest cost of living crisis since records began in the s. .milion Brits including half a million children will be dragged below the poverty line despite Rishi Sunak‘s Spring Statement, devastating analysis says. Critics say his aposAlice in Wonderlandapos Spring Statement wonapost touch the sides as a series of price rises come down the track next month. As he announced one £m fund MPs shouted: Is that it IFS think tank director Paul Johnson warned perhaps what really stands out today is what was missing, adding: He has done nothing more for those dependent on benefits, the very poorest, besides a small amount of extra cash for local authorities to dispense at their discretion. Their benefits will rise by just .% for the coming financial year. Their cost of living could well rise by %.”The Chancellor announced cuts to National Insurance. He also promised to cut income tax from p to p in the pound in April , just in time for a general election. But there was almost no help for those out of work, and nothing to improve the level of benefits. The Resolution Foundation said the poorest fth of households will gain just £ from todayaposs Spring Statement - compared to £ for middle earners and £ for the wealthiest.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Spring StatementPoliticsRishi Sunak\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ministers attended eight meetings with testing firm Randox - twice as many as previously disclosed - but kept minutes for just two, according to the National Audit Office’s investigation. The firm and its strategic partner Qnostics Ltd were handed £. million with of contracts - % of which were awarded without competition under emergency procurement rules. The firm had former Tory MP Owen Paterson on their payroll as a consultant.And documents released last month revealed he had personally lobbied then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock for the firm - and asking him to kill news stories making claims about his involvement with the initial £m deal.Before the NAO’s report today, the government had admitted to four ministerial meetings with Randox since the start of the pandemic.  But the NAO identied a further four where the Department of Health and Social Carehad failed to record Randox’s attendance on official transparency releases. They also found documents which “indicated” one-to-one telephone calls between ministers - including Mr Hancock and former le sciences minister Lord Bethell - and representatives of Randox, including Mr Paterson.  DHSC could not confirm to the NAO whether the calls took place, or any notes from the discussions. Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: Even taking these exceptional circumstances into account, the documentation of the decision-making process for such large contracts was inadequate.”  Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee added: Government grasped the urgent need to increase the scale of testing early in the pandemic. But while it was fast on procurement, it was fast and loose on process. While the body found no evidence contracts were handed out improperly, the gaps in records meant they were not able to provide positive assurance in the normal way.” The report read: “This report should not be considered as offering positive assurance over any of these contracts which are not detailed in the report or as offering any legal opinion on the use of public procurement regulations.” Despite this, Mr Hancock claimed the report had given ministers a “clean bill of health”, adding “the report found no evidence of wrongdoing because there was no wrongdoing.”The report noted Mr Hancock had used private email and WhatsApp to discuss Randox with Mr Paterson.He did not disclose all the messages to DHSC officials at the time, telling investigators he did not believe they were “substantive” discussions, and he was not required to do so under Cabinet Office rules. He later made his phone available to investigators and to the department.The report also notes the Information Commissioner is investigating the use of private correspondence channels at DHSC, but has yet to publish its report. DHSC was “unable to provide” key evidence to investigators about decision making - and because notes were not recorded in the department’s existing systems, they had to search several officials’ email accounts to find it. “The Department gave us incomplete or no documentation on other signicant aspects of the procurement,” the report reads. “Including detailed due diligence, detailed contractual negotiations leading to the first contact award, and considering of potential conflicts of interest.” Records seen by the NAO suggest officials did not think conflicts of interest rules applied to emergency direct awards. “This reflects an incorrect understanding of the relevant regulations,” the report reads. A spokesperson for Mr Hancock said: “Mr Hancock warmly welcomes this thorough report by the NAO, which confirms a total clean bill of health on Ministers’ work with Randox during the pandemic. The report found no evidence of wrongdoing because there was no wrongdoing - just lots of hard work to expand testing capacity. While the department will no doubt reflect on the technical issues that need to be addressed, the report sets out that Ministers and Officials in the Department were doing their very best to save lives in what was a quick moving and unprecedented situation. Mr Hancockaposs thoughts remain with the victims and their loved ones.  Ms Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: “Government grasped the urgent need to increase the scale of testing early in the pandemic. But while it was fast on procurement, it was fast and loose on process. “The Randox contracts illustrate that proper transparency by government is vital. Government didn’t document decisions properly and the public is right to raise questions about whether it was playing with a straight bat. “Over % of testing contracts were awarded to ‘high priority’ companies, including those referred by ministers, MPs or Number . The public needs to trust that their taxes are spent on the basis that it’s what you know, not who you know. “As with many of the COVID response schemes, lessons must be learned about delivering at speed.” A spokesperson for Randox said: “We welcome the finding of the NAO report that there is no evidence of any impropriety in the awarding of government contracts to Randox. “This independent finding vindicates what both Randox and the Government have always said, that these contracts were awarded on merit and in keeping with government protocols and regulations at a time of acute national emergency. “During the pandemic, Randox delivered more than  million gold standard PCR tests, becoming the first laboratory in the world to process more than , tests daily. “In doing so, Randox played its part in helping save tens of thousands of lives, keeping vital sectors of the economy open and enabling essential overseas family and business travel. “The report states that four ministerial meetings took place which were, apparently, not fully documented by the DHSC. “While we cannot comment on government minuting of meetings, Randox can categorically state that the awarding of contracts was not on the agenda at any of these meetings.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WhatsAppNational Audit OfficeLord BethellGareth DaviesOwen PatersonBoris JohnsonMeg HillierPoliticsSolar powerCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily health briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The highest inflation in  years and the worst income squeeze on record lie ahead of us.While household finances are taking a hammering, the public finances have actually been on the up: we’re all paying more taxes than the Government expected. Using that headroom, the Chancellor today prioritised rebuilding his tax cutting credentials over support for the low-to-middle income households hardest hit. A p cut to fuel duty will save the typical driving households £ a year, but only reverse  per cent of the increase in pump prices over the past year.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section An increase in how much you can earn before you start paying National Insurance will be welcome relief for many, but middle and top income households will gain the most. In fact only £ in every £ of new support goes to the poorer half of families.

Tax receipts as a share of the economy are set to reach their highest level since - – we’re talking the equivalent of a £, rise per household since the  election. Today the Chancellor announced a bigger policy package than expected, but it was badly designed. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually.

Families are facing a devastating a cost of living crisis. And the Chancellor could have helped them out, by scrapping his tax rise on jobs.He could have introduced a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to cut household energy bills. He could have finally brought forward a plan to support British business and create good jobs. That’s what a Labour Government would have delivered. But instead, years of Tory tax rises means that after today the OBR say that we will still have the highest tax burden in  years. Not only that, April will now bring the biggest fall in family incomes since records began.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Even with the Chancellor’s cynical changes, he’s only shaving £ off every £ he’s taxing people. This simply isn’t going to cut it as inflation spirals out of control. Britain’s people needs a government on their side. Instead, we have one that wants to raise taxes and leave working people paying the price. Come April, a landlord with a large number of properties or someone who makes huge sums from buying and selling stocks and shares won’t be paying any more in tax, but their tenants will. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersWhy does the Chancellor repeatedly feel the need to raise taxes on working people, when no other major economy is doing so  Conservative governments’ failure to get our economy growing over the past  years means less revenue going into the Exchequer. And in the past two years, they have wasted taxpayers’ money – throwing it around like confetti, handing out covid loans to fraudsters which will never be repaid and wasting billions on unusable PPE. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. The Conservatives are the party of high taxes, because they are the party of low growth and wasteful spending. The promise of crumbs in two years’ time will be of little comfort to families struggling to pay the bills today. It is timed to suit the Tory party’s interests, not the national interest. Working families and businesses are set to endure greater hardship because of the choices Rishi Sunak has made.

The MoD has  entries in the Government Major Projects Portfolio, with “total whole-le” costs of £.billion, according to the National Audit Office. Worryingly, two of the projects are categorised as red, meaning “successful delivery of the project appears to be unachievable.Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter “There are major issues with project definition, schedule, budget, quality and or benefits delivery, which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or resolvable.  “The project may need re-scoping and or its overall viability reassessed.” One programme rated red is the vital Crowsnest radar system to be fitted to Royal Navy Merlin helicopters protecting the aircraft carrier strike groups. It is meant to provide “organic airborne surveillance and control capability”.  The other is the £.bn Armoured Cavalry programme for  Ajax fighting vehicles. Just  have been delivered and they have given troops hearing problems. Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said: “As NATO leaders meet to respond to Russian aggression, ministers are failing to equip our armed forces with the full kit and equipment to fight and fulfil our NATO obligations.“The Ministry of Defence is a uniquely failing department with no major programme set for delivery on time and on budget, while at least £bn has also been wasted in taxpayers’ money since .“On day one, Labour in government would get the NAO to do an across-the-board audit of MoD waste and make the MoD the first department subject to our new Office for Value of Money’s tough regime on spending decisions.” Projects in the NAO’s -page “Departmental Overview of the Ministry of Defence”, published last month, have come under fresh scrutiny amid Russia ’s war with Ukraine.Vladimir Putin ’s invasion has triggered tomorrowaposs emergency summit at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where the Prime Minister is expected to welcome new defence spending pledges by allies - and urge counterparts to go further in supporting Kyiv.But details uncovered by Labour reveal the extent to which Mr Johnson should be worried about defence procurement at home. Multibillion-pound deals are rated in one of five colour-coded categories.  According to Whitehall’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority, green means “successful delivery of the project on time, budget and quality appears highly likely and there are no major outstanding issues that at this stage appear to threaten delivery signicantly”. But that does not apply to any of the MoD’s schemes. Twelve are given the amber red rating, meaning “successful delivery of the project is in doubt, with major risks or issues apparent in a number of key areas. “Urgent action is needed to address these problems and or assess whether resolution is feasible.” Fourteen are rated amber, meaning “successful delivery appears feasible but signicant issues already exist, requiring management attention. “These appear resolvable at this stage and,addressed promptly, should not present a cost schedule overrun.” An MoD spokesman said: “Our latest available figures show the majority of MoD’s major projects are capable of being delivered on time and in budget. “We are making the largest investment in our armed forces since the end of the Cold War, with an additional £bn helping ensure they have the equipment they need to meet future threats.” It is understood the most up-to-date figures show % of the MoD’s Government Major Projects Portfolio are rated as amber or better, with problems that,addressed promptly, should not trigger extra costs or delays.

Families across the country are worried about rising food and fuel costs, soaring inflation and rocketing energy bills. A bold Chancellor would have seized this opportunity to deliver a new economic deal for the British people. Instead we got some tinkering with the tax system and a promise of more support further down the line. When families needed shelter from the economic downpour, the Chancellor offered the equivalent of raising a cocktail umbrella in the middle of a hurricane. Almost all the indicators on the economic dashboard are flashing red.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Growth forecasts have been slashed, inflation is set to rise to a -year high and the country is set for the biggest fall in living standards since . What support Mr Sunak did provide was either too paltry to make a signicant dference, such as the cut in fuel duty, or a piece of fiscal sleight of hand. Nothing The raising of the National Insurance threshold and the promised cut in income tax will not compensate for the tax hikes coming into force next month. Overall, the tax burden is set to rise to its highest level since the Second World War. Mr Sunak’s claim to be a low-tax Chancellor is as absurd as his claim he was “standing by” families during the cost-of-living crisis. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersThere was no extra support to help people with energy bills even though they are set to increase by £, on average by this autumn. And there was nothing to help pensioners, the very low-paid and those on social security. Mr Sunak is condemning more people to poverty and more people to choose between heating and eating. Despite Conservative claims that the age of austerity is over, our public services will now receive less funding than originally announced. There will be less money for health, for schools, councils, and the armed forces. People looked to the Chancellor yesterday for help and reassurance. He delivered a financial statement that leaves only anxiety and trepidation.

A typical working-age household will see their real income fall % next year - a loss of £,, the Resolution Foundation think tank said. Absolute poverty - rather than relative poverty - is crucial because it is the measure Boris Johnson chooses to use.In  the PM controversially boasted poverty had fallen when relative poverty was up and absolute poverty was down. It comes after the Budget watchdog said soaring inflation - expected to nudge % in a four-decade high - will inflict the biggest disposable income drop since records began in the s. And today the Foundation warned poorer Brits will be hit harder as the Tory Chancellor refused to raise benefits - which will rise at less than half inflation. Meanwhile his £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will mostly benefit people in work.Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the overnight analysis found.The experts said: “The scale and distribution of the cost of living squeeze, coupled with the lack of support for low-income families, means that a further . million people are set to fall into absolute poverty next year, including , children – the first time Britain has seen such a rise outside of recessions.” With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Despite the tax cuts yesterday, the think tank said only those earning between £, and £, will actually pay less income tax in -. And only those earning between £, and £, will pay less tax and National Insurance . Of the  million people in work, around  millionwill pay more in income tax and NI in -, the think tank said. By  earnings will be £, behind what they would have beenthey had continued growing on the pre- path.  Torsten Bell, Chief Executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “In the face of a cost of living crisis that looks set to make this Parliament the worst on record for household incomes, the Chancellor came to the dispatch box yesterday promising support with the cost of living today, and tax cuts tomorrow. Signicant measures were announced on both counts, but the big picture is that policy does not measure up to the rhetoric. “The decision not to target support at those hardest hit by rising prices will leave low-and-middle income households painfully exposed, with . million people, including half a million children, set to fall below the poverty line this coming year. “And despite the eye-catching p cut to income tax, the reality is that the Chancellor’s tax changes mean that seven-in-eight workers will see their tax bills rise. Those tax rises mean the Chancellor is able to point to a swt fiscal consolidation and signicant headroom against his fiscal rules. “The big picture is that Rishi Sunak has prioritised rebuilding his tax-cutting credentials over supporting the low-to-middle income households who will be hardest hit from the surging cost of living, while also leaving himself fiscal flexibility in the years ahead. Whether that will be sustainable in the face of huge income falls to come remains to be seen.”  Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog chairman Richard Hughes said despite the measures announced by Rishi Sunak, people still face an unprecedented fall in living standards. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: So in total, they amount to about an £ billion giveaway in this spring statement coming from the Chancellor. That offsets around a third of the overall hit to living standards that people would otherwise have felt had he not taken those measures, so without the Chancellor taking action, people would have felt a % fall in their living standards in the coming  months. That reduces it down to around %, but itaposs still an unprecedented fall in peopleaposs standard of living over the next  months. Mr Hughes also said energy bills are doubling over the course of the year, rising by around % in April and another % in October.

The top Tory took calls from listeners at LBC on Wednesday after unveiling his Spring Statement, which did almost nothing to help Brits who will be clobbered by higher fuel bills when Ofgem raises the energy cap on April . The mum-of-two, who has three jobs, said she was a woman who on paper has a good job and whataposs considered a good salary but rising energy prices has now put an intense strain on my ability to provide for my children. Pleading with him to do more for families, she said: The signicant increase in our energy bills has meant that we donapost have the boiler on. The lights are always off unless absolutely necessary and when itaposs cold, we wear jumpers and coats and sometimes you can see our breaths when we breathe.  Now, despite working a full time job Iaposm having to find ways to bridge the gap. Iaposve started cleaning houses and I spend every evening riding a bike delivering Uber Eats. Iaposve managed to cut my grocery shop down to just £ a week for an adult and two children, and I often go without myself to make sure the kids get what they need and theyaposre fed. Before today, the Chancellor announced all energy customers will get a £ refund on their energy bill later in the year, which will be applied automatically from October.But it led to Mr Sunak being branded the loan shark Chancellor by Labour as the discount will be clawed back will need to be repaid in £ annual instalments, from April  over five years.Millions of Brits will also be eligible for a £ rebate off their council tax bill this year. The council tax rebate will apply to homes in council tax bands A, B, C or D in England and Wales - roughly % of properties - but not those who live in council tax bands E, F, G and H . Hzul told the Chancellor the governmentaposs £ off council tax and £ energy loan to cope with rising energy bills just isnapost going to cut it.  Iaposve just about been able to balance things up until this point, but Iaposm now facing paying out more each month that Iaposm making, Hzul said. What are you going to do to address the soaring cost of energy andyouaposre not doing anything, please me what  do you suggest I can be doing to help myself The Chancellor has been under mounting pressure to help Brits struggling with their energy bills as regulator Ofgem prepares to lt price cap by £ from April .It will mean a % jump most householdsapos bills - which go up from £, to £, - and prepayment customers will be worse off, with a bills hike of £ from £, to £,. Mr Sunak told Hzul: I canapost imagine how dficult your job is, adding he had enormous admiration for what youaposre doing, an it sounds like youaposre working your socks off to look after them, so tribute to you. He admitted there was no further help on offer apart from the council tax rebate and the energy loan, and we would have to seein October energy bills would be raised again.

Cometh the hour, cometh the blinkered out of touch Chancellor failing to rise to the challenge. Heaposs fiddled while household budgets are burning from searing inflation averaging .% thataposll deliver the worst cut in living standards for more than half a century. Back to the s may prove Sunakaposs prospects of succeeding Boris Johnson are hitting the rocks. Taking more money out of peopleaposs pay packets and bank accounts when prices are rocketing is the Tory Treasury pouring petrol on the cost of living crisis. This Chancellor remains a record tax raiser, upping the National Insurance threshold giving back only a little of the extra £-billion to be grabbed. Reducing fuel duty p might never be felt at the pumps and is a fraction of an increase in the price of a litre since topping p since the start of the year.And that promise of a p Income Tax cut in two years is an election bribe suggesting a contest in Autumn  or Spring . It deserves to be greeted with the same suspicion generated by PO claims the ferry firm obeys the law. The  Conservative Manesto promised NI wouldnapost go up , the pension triple-lock would continue and international aid was protected . The penny off tax also exposes the Tory lie the NI jump is a hypothecated health and social care levy when the switch emphasises itaposs really another tax rise but a little will be ed. Sunak, Johnson and Conservative ideology are the main problem. Not Covid last year, Ukraine this year or next year presumably a big boy with a stick who ran away. The Tories are proving politically, practically and ideologically incapable of helping keep families afloat. Never mind prosper.

The tunnel has graffiti-stained walls and echoes of footsteps and passing trains in the abandoned spaceThe abandoned Camden tunnels were originally used to transport horses and pit ponies in the th century.BySamantha Mordi:,  Mar |commentsA photographer who has been exploring London Underground tunnels for six years has captured creepy images of an abandoned station. Callum Cromwell, shot a disused tunnel called aposCamdenaposs Rat Holeapos on his Nikon camera. The -year-old said the scariest moment of the shoot was hearing trains echo throughout the space as he filmed. The only signs of le in the eerily isolated tunnel were the graffiti-stained walls and sounds of footsteps over the rock terrain. Further scenes showed faint torchlight cast over the forgotten tracks. The abandoned Camden tunnels were originally used to transport horses and pit ponies in the th century. The Camden service tunnel cuts underneath the mainline tracks between Euston and Chalk Farm. The tunnel is a place I have been wanting to explore for around five years, but itaposs only recently become accessible again, Callum, who is from Reading said.The tunnel is now sealed though. I found it through doing a bit of research into hidden and disused derelict London underground locations. The tunnel entrance was pretty easy to get into. The place is a huge giant steel tunnel which is over nine-hundred yards long, and the place had a really damp smell to it The only scary moment was hearing the trains on a nearby active track whizzing by and echoing through the tunnel, but thataposs part of the thrill. I have been exploring for six years now and have been going to locations all over the place. Urban exploring is about finding and exploring hidden and disused derelict sites that not many get to see, but there are certain rules which apply to it such as do not break in, do not steal, do not do damage, only take photos and leave footprints. The series of disused tunnels, also known as the Camden Catacombs, were built by Robert Stephenson. In , wine importers W.  A. Gilbey used the network to store alcohol. In recent years, the network of vaults and tunnels are largely submerged due to flooding. This comes after a secret tunnel was discovered in Elstree. Not open to the public, nor is it a fancy escape route for the rich, the monorail is owned by the electricity grid as their inspection railway. Completed in November , the private underground monorail service runs from Elstree to St Johnaposs Wood.The system sits  metres below the ground, and connects two kV substations at each location, Herts Live reported. According to an article written by transport enthusiast IanVisits, the substation was required to keep up with Londonaposs massive demand for power. Construction began in April  for the tunnel, which is three metres wide - not much smaller than a tube tunnel.

The Department of Health and Social Care said that more details would be set out “shortly”.

The UK will enjoys warmer weather than Spanish hotspots Marbella and Lanzarote on Thursday with another roasting day ahead. The Met Office is predicting that temperatures could again peak at C on Thursday, for the third day in a row.The south east of England will be the warmest today, with London enjoying the highs at pm this afternoon. After first predicting a wintry weekend, the sun is now expected to shine for many on Saturday before Sunday sees a drop off in the heat.  Cambridgeshire may also see C today and temperatures could peak at C from pm in Liverpool, making it hotter than Barcelona. The warm weather this week is the result of a high pressure system that has moved in from the east and is now settled on the country for the next few days. We were told to enjoy it while we can but now it seems Saturday will also be baking, with C in the south now predicted. However, things could take a massive turn as the UK enters April, with one weather service suggesting lows of -C in Scotland.Parts of Wales instead look set to see temperatures y from C to C while England could see highs of just C in Cornwall. But before the colder conditions do come, March will end with sun almost everywhere. “This settled spell of spring sunshine carries on for the rest of the week and beyond, Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said. “With clear skies expected tonight temperatures will fall away and a few mist and fog patches could form in one or two spots.  They will be fairly isolated and most likely in parts of eastern England for example like recent nights with temperatures dipping away as well. A touch of frost in places as we start off Thursday. Frost free Western Isles, parts of Northern Ireland where it will turn cloudier through the night, perhaps one or two showers into the Western Isles.” The UKaposs national weather service said in its long-range forecast: Still settled for many at the start of next week but a trend to showery and colder conditions is expected to take place from the north from Monday.  “Showers will likely be focused on northern and eastern areas, potentially wintry over northern hills and at lower levels in the far northeast. “A good deal of dry weather persisting in the south and west. Potential for strong winds in the far northeast early in the period. “Later next week and beyond, more unsettled conditions are likely with more frequent showers or longer spells of rain for many areas. “After a spell of below average temperatures next week, temperatures are likely toto near average later in the period.” Friday: Again dry and warm with sunny spells for many although cloudier in the far northwest. One or two isolated afternoon showers may develop across northern England and southeastern Northern Ireland. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Mainly settled with light winds and warm sunny spells cloudier in the far north with occasional light rain. Early mist fog patches in places, clearning inland but lingering near some coasts.

On Thursday more C heat means that the UK will be warmer than the Spanish holiday island of Lanzarote. Like Wednesday the day will start cold before the sunshine arrives.  “This settled spell of spring sunshine carries on for the rest of the week and beyond, Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said. “With clear skies expected tonight temperatures will fall away and a few mist and fog patches could form in one or two spots.

Frost free Western Isles, parts of Northern Ireland where it will turn cloudier through the night, perhaps one or two showers into the Western Isles.” Air from the Atlantic is bringing cloudier skies for the north west of Scotland and spots of rain but the high pressure is dominant over the UK meaning warm weather for most.  Mr McGivern continued: On the whole after a chilly start. Much of the UK still basking in that warm March sunshine and temperatures similar across England and Wales to recent days C to C, could squeeze a C in Cambridgeshire for example. Then for Friday there is more of the same eventemperatures are fractionally lower. “Plenty more, well, fine weather to come ... blue skies across the board virtually just one exception there for Shetland, Orkney, thicker clouds, a few drizzly showers at time but where largely dry, said Mr McGivern. For the vast majority dry once againand those temperatures are responding. Technically down a degree or so compared to the last couple of days but with light winds and sunshine I doubt it will be that noticeable. And really those temperatures in place are C perhaps C above average so very warm for the time of year. UK forecast for the next  days Rather cloudy in the northwest, where mostly dry and sunny Today: Early fog patches quickly clearing to leave another warm day with plenty of sunshine for most. Very isolated afternoon showers may develop in the north, more likely over eastern Scotland. Cloudier in the northwest with some light rain at times. Tonight: Rather cloudy for parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, especially the far north and northwest where a little light rain. Clear where with patchy frost and a few fog patches. Friday: Again dry and warm with sunny spells for many although cloudier in the far northwest. One or two isolated afternoon showers may develop across northern England and southeastern Northern Ireland.

The -year-old, from Tampa, Florida, was admitted to Tampa General hospital in January this year and her condition started to deteriorate rapidly over a two week period due to organ failure.Claire, who was born with a congenital heart condition, was also diagnosed with myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, mild pneumonia, cyanosis and acidosis, Yahoo News reports.She was given a TandemHeart – which helps to send a steady supply of oxygenated blood to organs – and hours after that was placed on continuous dialysis because of her failing kidneys. As the complications worsened, so did the condition in her leg so doctors performed a fasciotomy to relieve the swelling and pressure. Despite trying to save her legs, the damage was too severe and irreversible, her dad Wayne Bridges revealed. In February Ms Bridges, who is vaccinated, had both legs cut off above the knee. She wasnapost getting circulation to her legs and, because of that, there was a lot of muscle damage, her best friend Heather Valdes told WTVT, Newsweek reported. Doctors also discovered she was bleeding internally resulting in an emergency blood transfusion.They found a very rare lesion in the first part of the small intestines that had ruptured, her dad revealed on Facebook. Luckily they were able to fix it and stop the bleeding. Despite the le-changing event, Ms Bridges remained positive according to family and friends who described her as an amazing young woman and a warrior. Her dad Wayne has detailed his daughteraposs journey on Facebook and revealed on March  that she was finally able to sit up herself for the first time since January. Two months to the day this all started and Claire, for the first time sat up by herself, he wrote on Facebook. It may not seem like a lot, but for this Warrior itaposs a major victory! And for this victory, it looks like our Warrior girl is coming home to her momaposs house today for the rehab phase of her journey. This week, Claire was released from hospital in time for her st birthday. She is very happy to be home around family and friends, Mr Bridges told Newsweek. Itaposs been mentally, emotionally taxing but weaposre hopeful now. She is still facing more challenges but we are focused on having her home. Mr Bridges said his daughter will require ongoing rehab with physical and occupational therapy. She will also need to prepare for prosthetic legs. Mr Bridges set up a GoFundMe page for his daughter with hopes to raise £, which will go towards Claireaposs medical and ongoing recovery expenses. I am so proud of you and inspired by you. You have overcome more in two months than any of us could imagine in a letime, Mr Bridges wrote in a touching tribute on Facebook. You will be climbing again before you know it.

OBrien has now been sentenced to a juvenile facilityTravis O’Brien, now , has been sentenced to a juvenile facilityByTim HanlonNews Reporter:,  Mar A -year-old boy and a -year-old pal armed with an AK- held a  minute shoot-out with police in Florida. Travis O’Brien, now , has been sentenced to a juvenile facility after firing at police in June last year along with his teen accomplice Nicole Jackson. The pair had broken out of a local children’s home and had entered a house in Volusia County when the gun fight started.Defence lawyer Jeff Deen told WESH-TV : “He’s a little tiny, little boy and he got into a big mess.“He wasn’t in control of his situation and he can’t understand some of the things that we understand.” The youngster pleaded no contest to charges of burglary, criminal mischief and attempted murder of law enforcement officers, and was remanded to a maximum-risk assessment programme followed by a conditional release.  The “Bonnie and Clyde” duo had escaped from Florida United Methodist Children’s Home and were hiding in an empty home in nearby Enterprise on June . Police arrived after reports of a break-in at the property and began to be fired at by the two children. The gun battle continued for  minutes with an officer heard saying on a viral video at one point that Jackson was “re-racking”. The officer said: “Female has a shotgun in her hand, stand by.” He is then heard shouting “put the gun down now” and then shooting can be heard.  “They’re shooting on me,” the officer then said. “Hold the air. I’m code . She’s re-racking a round inside the shotgun.” The dispatcher replies: “Let’s not engage them anymore. “Let’s not challenge them.” But the officer said: “She’s racked a round in the shotgun. The window’s busted on the patio side. If she comes out she’s going to have the shotgun.” Then moments later Jackson came out of the house with gun and was shot - with her screams heard in video footage. “I think the female’s down,” an officer said. “Call in the units. Female’s on the ground behind the car.”  The footage then shows the boy surrendering and being taken into custody. Jackson was taken to hospital with le threatening injuries after being shot in the chest and arm but she recovered after surgery. She is yet to be sentenced for her involvement in the incident. Meanwhile, a couple, Shauna and Dan Willis, have reportedly offered to adopt Jackson after talking to her by phone from her jail.“We just have good intentions in mind for her. So, we pray for her every day, andwe can give her a family, we’d be willing to do that,” Shauna Willis told WNDU.Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON PoliceCrimeBurglary\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The home video footage shows the two heartless dog owners allow their pets to freely attack the cat, named Buddy, who was sitting on the porch. The men can be heard shouting get him and good boy while the dogs attack the cat. Moments beforehand, the two men could be seen on camera with their dogs walking past the home, before stopping after noticing the cat. The horric attack lasts  seconds before a homeowner comes out to try and save the cat.  Someone can be heard shouting no, while Buddy is clearly in discomfort. Pennsylvania SPCA are investigating the attack, which happened in Frankford, Philadelphia on Tuesday morning. The Pennsylvania SPCA is asking for the public’s help identying two iniduals who appear to be responsible for an intentional dog attack on a family’s cat in the city’s Frankford neighbourhood this morning, Pennsylvania SPCA said in a statement.  The video shows two iniduals walking two dogs passed a family home on Granite Street. On the video it appears that an inidual spots the cat named Buddy on a porch, comes back and releases one dog on the cat followed by a second dog. As the attack continued, a person or persons can be heard on the video encouraging the dogs to continue attacking the cat until a resident of the property comes out to intervene on behalf of the cat. Buddy sustained le-threatening injuries and was transported to the PSPCA.  In an update posted on Wednesday, Pennsylvania SPCA said Buddy had been sent to an ER vet to be closely monitored. He made it through the night. He continues to be in extremely critical condition. We arecautiously optimistic, the update said. Pennsylvania SPCA have now released pictures of two men they wish to identy in connection with the attack. Anyone with information is urged to contact the PSPCAaposs cruelty hotline -- or cruelty@pspca.org. Tips can be left anonymously.

Clem Johnson, , first started sharing the pictures of his mumaposs cooking with his mates as a laugh as he found himself constantly being served bizarre dinners such as microwaved bacon, pie with cream crackers, and spaghetti with ketchup. The Liverpool season ticket holder often joked to his pals that some of the meals were unidentiable, and his friends would get involved with the banter, as one even said his dinner looked like it had been cooked in a washing machine. Clemaposs friend Owen Southwood, , was so stunned by the array of strange dishes his mate was eating that he just had to share it with the world - and posted hilarious reviews of the dishes on Twitter.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The thread attracted more than , likes and , retweets, and Owen admitted the pie and crackers dish was among the worst heaposd ever seen. He said: He’s taking the p**s [out of the meals] with most of the pictures. I think he doesn’t mind the spaghetti and sausages but for the rest of them, he’s taking the p**s. We all just send our food in whenever we make something that looks nice, so he does the opposite. It started about two months ago with the sausages and spaghetti. His mum cooks the majority of them. Some of them caused more of a stir in the group than others.  The best-looking one is probably the curry - it looks edible and would probably taste okay. The worst one was the spaghetti with egg and bacon. We voted as a group that it was the worst meal we’d ever seen. The egg and chips weren’t even that bad really - it’s just the presentation. The pie on crackers got called worse than rations. And Clem says he lets his mum cook the dinners as he hates cooking, but he loves seeing the reaction of horried people online. He explained: Iaposve been sending them in for ages as a laugh to see their reaction. I hate cooking it’s just too much effort for five minutes to eat. I live with my mum so she cooks.  Owen said aposenoughaposs enough - it’s going on Twitterapos. All my mates have been laughing for ages. I didn’t think it’d go viral on Twitter though. The reaction onlineaposs been funny. At first, I tried to keep it anonymous but loads of people worked out it was me. I reckon chip and eggs isn’t even that bad. Pie and crackers were definitely a low. I saw that a lad donated £ to a food bank, so that’s all that matters. I don’t go hungry so all good. One of Owenaposs Twitter reviews read: Without doubt the single worst meal I have EVER seen consumed, there are starving refugees who would turn their nose up at this, the bacon was also cooked in the microwave.   While another said: This is supposed to be a fajita, the block of what looks like butter is a solid block of cheese and yes they are baked beans. .  And although Clem is in on the joke, he also took to Twitter to encourage those who laugh at his scran to do what they can to donate to food banks. He tweeted: Now youaposve all had your laugh, can I be serious  Ye my scranaposs s**t, but I’ve got something on my plate. Loads of people don’t.

Image: Gregor Stewart   CATERS NEWSByLiam Buckler:,  Mar |commentsA man who bought a ventriloquist doll believes its haunted as its mouth spookily opens and closes all by itself. Gregor Stewart, , from Fe, Scotland purchased the doll four years ago from a dealer in Calornia, US, who wanted to sell it to someone as far away from him as possible. However, since becoming the owner of the ventriloquist doll, who he calls Uncle Herb, Gregor believes he has witnessed the doll opening and closing its mouth even though the mechanism of the mouth does not work. The building surveyor said: I think that when Uncle Herb opens his mouth it means that he is not happy about something. When we first got him, we were putting him in a case on his own for a while to give him time to settle and that is when his mouth first opened.And by the time we went to get him back out of the case he had closed his mouth. So I think that when he closes his mouth, it means that he is happy and settled down again. We spoke to the spirit that was attached to the doll through a spirit box, a paranormal research device which allows spirits to communicate by manipulating white noise to form words and phrases, and asked what the name was. He told us it was Herbert and we shortened it to Uncle Herb because we know there is a connection to an uncle in his story. The spirit attached to uncle Herb was frustrated at being forgotten as he had never been given a name and had previously belonged to an elderly woman who kept him in a cupboard. Since we have had him, he had had lots of people engaging with him and heaposs been given a name so there is a much more positive energy around him. During conversation with uncle Herb, Gregor says that he has referenced prison. And he believes he doesnapost like being in the case and opens his mouth to show his feelings towards this. The person that sold Uncle Herb to Gregor received the doll from a family he had known for some time. The elderly lady who owned the doll had passed away and the family wanted to get rid of him.  Gregor said: The doll was kept away in a cupboard and the family would always hear lots of noises coming from where he was kept. The rest of the family were never keen on the doll, and when the lady passed away they wanted it off their hands and gave it to a family friend. They had warned him about it but he was happy to take it. Once the man got it back to his home, he said that he was constantly hearing footsteps through the night. He eventually moved it to his garage but the noises and disturbances continued so he decided to put it up for sale. He was in Calornia and he refused to sell it to anyone in the same state as him because he wanted to be as far away from the doll as possible. The fact that he didnapost even want to be near the doll spiked my interest even more. So I got in touch and askedScotland was far enough away. I got into conversation with him to find out as much as possible and to make sure it was genuine. We agreed on a price and he came over to Scotland. Mr Stewart claims uncle Herb was very quiet when he arrive and he only started to communicate with the doll through spirit boxes and noticed that his mouth would open and close by itself. He said: When I first saw the doll in real le I was expecting to feel negative energy from him, but I didnapost get that at all. When I noticed that his mouth would open and close sometimes, I was even more interested and curious. Initially people would get a feeling of discomfort around him but now people just want to hold him and cuddle him. He is always on display as he doesnapost like being kept in a case. He is sat on a shelf. We only ever have him in a case for protection because he is old and delicate. We estimate that he is from the early s. He is such an intriguing doll.

Shana Oakley, from North Carolina, USA, was left with ptosis, a condition where the upper eyelid droops. She was unable to see from her right eye for over a month after having Botox on th January  . Although having since made a full recovery, her right eye was left lopsided six weeks after the Botox injection. Shana, , says her neurologist carried out the procedure to treat migraines. However, despite receiving the medical botox from a trained doctor it went horribly wrong as she could not see out of her right eye for a month. And despite having had both cosmetic and medical botox before, Shana admitted the treatment administered by a beautician is less painful and nothing has gone wrong before.She said: “I had a lot of comments from people who got ptosis after having medical Botox done by a neurologist. “I was thinking neurologists would be safer, but it doesn’t matter the level of education they have it just matters how often they inject people and cosmetic injectors do it way more often than neurologists do.” However, TikTok users likened Shana to a ‘Villain in a videogame’ and although Shana agreed she did admit she will miss the eyepatch. After being able to relate to the TikTok users comments about her eye appearance, she certainly did not want to go through the condition again.“It took a month for me to be able to see clearly and like a month and a half to look normal,” Shana explained. However, the episode has not put off Shana from having cosmetic Botox again. She said: “I will for sure do cosmetic Botox again but I’m not sure about medical because I had a ton of comments from people telling me to never let a neurologist inject my face, only a cosmetic injector. “I started cosmetic after doing the medical and noticing I needed like a cosmetic touch up from the medical to even my foreheadthat makes sense.  She also believes the treatment hurts far more when a neurologist performs it than when a cosmetic injector does it, she explained: “I noticed that it hurts more when the neurologist does it than when the cosmetic injector does so it makes sense that cosmetic injectors definitely know what they are doing more.” And when Shana posted a video about her ptosis on her TikTok pageit got a huge . million views with people seeing the funny side, now sheaposs thankfully recovered, but also wanted to highlight the condition ptosis.

Steve told WCCB : We just thought it would make sense for the gay dog to be adopted by a loving gay family.We’ve been subject to that kind of bigotry and ignorance throughout our lives together, and we couldn’t always do anything about it. We looked at each other and said, we can do something about this. According to research, male and female dogs, whether theyaposre neutered or not, will hump other dogs for a number of reasons including non-sexual play, social interaction, stress relief or due to urinary tract problem.  A Dogster statement reads: The plain and simple fact is that dogs are indiscriminate about their humping. Boy dogs hump other boy dogs and girl dogs hump other girl dogs. Humans ascribe moral or ethical systems to everything, including having a wide range of conflicting notions of sexual propriety.

Heartbreaking images from Mariupol, Kharkiv and Kyiv show bombed-out schools, hospitals and government buildings - which once served as important sites for the townaposs community.Putinaposs forces have been met with fierce Ukrainian resistance and they are refusing to surrender amid reports of low morale among Russian soldiers and increasing frustration at the pace of the war from the Kremlin boss.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here It comes as Russian state TV has issued a chilling nuclear threat to the westNATO puts peacekeepers into Ukraine, saying World War Three might be around the corner.Moscowaposs tightly-controlled state TV went into propaganda overdrive, warning alliance leaders meeting in Brussels today against deploying any troops into Ukraine, eventhey were there to maintain peace.These chilling threats come four weeks into Russiaaposs invasion, as Putinaposs forces continue to bombard countless Ukrainian cities with air raids, but Kyivaposs resistance holds fast. Moscow continues to cover up the extent of its losses in the war, as it has not updated its official death toll in weeks. The ratcheting up of rhetoric saw blunt, undisguised warnings from the Kremlinaposs mouthpieces on state TV, worrying that Poland would seek a NATO mandate for peacekeepers.They also went on to claim Poland would seek a land grab, to snatch back Ukrainian territory that was once part of Poland, such as the city of Lviv.At the start of the invasion, Russian troops entered Kharkiv, which is about  miles south of the border from Russia. Peopleaposs homes were destroyed by Russian bombs - including that of a Holocaust survivor.

Omid tweeted: I do wonder what the hell palace organisers were thinking with some of yesterdayaposs photo moments.  The planning and recon that goes into every step of these engagements is next level, so how did no one think to avoid certain imagery apos This is why ersity on a team matters. But royal experts quickly commented that separate photos showed England footballer Raheem Sterling, who was born on the island, posing for similar shots with the fans after appearing on the pitch with the royals yesterday.  Wider shots also showed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge smiling, laughing and shaking hands with their supporters through the fence after the match. Royal editor and host of the Pod Save The Queen podcast Russell Myers posted: For all the commentary from tightly cropped pictures of William and Kate saying hello and shaking hands to people standing behind a metal fence, which was actually on a football field after a game, here is Raheem Sterling in the same place doing the same thing yesterday.apos He added: I donapost know where to start with this…. Incredibly disappointing manipulation and absolute distortion of facts, supplemented by a completely perverse take which I still canapost get my head around.  Omidaposs comments come as the Cambridgeaposs posed for smiling selfies and were met with chants of we love you, we love you on their first day in Jamaica, on a tour to mark the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee. The royals also met the Jamaican bobsleigh team, who finished th in the recent Winter Olympics, on their week-long tour that will next see them in the Bahamas.  But it comes as the Cambridgeaposs, on arrival in Jamaica were met by a much-publicised demonstration urging the monarchy to pay reparations for slavery, and there have been calls from politicians for the country to drop the Queen as head of state and become a republic. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s visit to Jamaica has given the nation the opportunity address “unresolved” issues, Prime Minister Andrew Holness has told the couple.  As he welcomed the couple before sitting down for talks, Mr Holness said: “There are issues here which are, as you would know, unresolved but your presence gives an opportunity for those issues to be placed in context, put front and centre and to be addressed in as bestas we can. “But Jamaica is, as you would see, a country that is very proud of our history, very proud of what we have achieved. “And we’re moving on and we intend to attain in short order our development goals and fulfil our true ambitions and destiny as an independent, developed, prosperous country.” Buckingham Palace declined to comment on Omid Scobieaposs claims.

Image: @charlotte.s_journey mediadrumimByLiam Buckler:,  Mar |commentsA mum-of-two believes she has found the perfect way to move on from her orce - by marrying herself. After orcing from her we back in , entrepreneur Charlotte Zum Vrde Sive Vrding, , from Voorburg in the Netherlands, decided after a year it was time to get remarried- to herself. Her friends and family were fully supportive and eight guests were in attendance at her wedding. She said: They were all instantly on board, she said. They were so enthusiastic about it. All of them dressed up so wonderfully. The ceremony was so lovely, it was small, with only my closest friends and my brothers. They all read their favourite memory they have with me and what they wish for me in the future. Then I read my vows out loud and gave myself the ring.  As part of Charlotteaposs vows she promised to be faithful to herself and embrace her body and personality. In addition, to keep trying new things eventhey scare her, to remain independent of others, to forgive herself for her mistakes, and to love herself. She threw herself a reception and even had her own wedding cake: We had a reception and they showered me in confetti, she said. We drank delicious organic vegan prosecco, I made my own vegan wedding cake, we had food and drinks, and laughed so much. I received some gorgeous gts among which a precious art work of bronze of two breasts being held by two hands. As so to say, grab yourself by the breasts, you are strong. Charlotte was inspired after her orce, when she founded female empowerment company Kamasense, which she says is focused on helping women develop self-love, self-appreciation and self-worth.Running the company helped her come to grips with her own value, and prompted her decision to propose to herself. I did no longer want to wait for someone to love me or be dependent on another human to be worthy, said Charlotte. I am already worthy. Worthy of love from myself and others, time, kindness, acceptance. So with that empty finger where my former engagement ring had been for years staring at me, I decided to marry myself. A relationship that will definitely last until the end of my time. It took about a year of working really hard on my self worth and mental health before I realised that although my le had been focused on buying a house, getting married and having kids in order to be happy,you truly accept yourself and value your time by yourself your goals change.In a society where womenaposs worth is considered little, yet the standards we are held against are so high - we must be moms, good moms, but not helicopter moms. We must work but not too much but also have a carer but not leave our babies, we must be good wives but also have an opinion but not a strong one, we must be beautul all the time but not too much make up but not too little. It is impossible. That is where marrying myself came in. Charlotte proposed to herself in July  and was engaged for three months, wearing a white gold engagement ring with three stones - one for herself, one for her daughter, , and her son, . She then had a wedding at her apartment in September , which cost less than £. Flowers cost £, as did candles for the ceremony. Charlotte also bought a tiara for the occasion for £, and she wore a £ dress that she already owned. Charlotte says that marrying herself has helped her view of romantic relationships and has given her higher standards for the future. Wearing the ring is a daily reminder of that wonderful evening, but even more so, that I am allowed, can and will love myself no matter what happens, she said. A reminder that I am strong and have overcome so many obstacles, that I will hold my boundaries and protect my peace. I highly recommend it, either as a strong finish of a mental health journey or as a start but really embrace yourself, do not fake it, make sure you feel it. My standards of a romantic partner are higher. I value myself and my time, and I will not let someone waste it for their entertainment. I love being by myself now, sosomeone wants to join my le, which I welcome, they do need to add to it in a positive way. Charlotte added that she would love to be married again some day - but that marrying herself means that she knows it will last a letime.

about what seeds to plant in the next few months.It’s a very satisfying project: dig your garden, plant some seeds, watch them germinate and nurture them into strong plants that you can harvest and eat, all in the space of a few months.These joys, though, are usually only accessible to those who have their own garden or space to grow in.That’s why Time for Change member Lix Armstrong wants to start a community food growing project in Ardrishaig, giving everyone the chance to experience the many benefits of growing their own food.The project is still in its planning stages, but will hopefully take shape in the form of allotment-style raised beds, and a shared polytunnel space to grow vegetables and fruit.Not only would this food growing project reduce greenhouse gas emissions relating to food miles, packaging and chemical fertilisers, it will also reduce food waste, as people are much more likely to eat misshapen or wonky vegetables that they’ve grown themselves.Vegetables that don’t look perfect are often left to rot in fields due to supermarket demands.In fact,  per cent of all food that is produced is wasted either on farms, in supermarkets, or in people’s homes.Not only is this a huge waste of resources, it is also a big source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane.Food waste in the UK produces  million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions every year.Emissions aside, community food growing also comes with huge social benefits, such as allowing more people to access fresh fruits and vegetables, reducing their reliance on less healthy processed foods.It’s also great for both the mental and physical health of participants, as repetitive, rewarding tasks like gardening are proven to lower stress levels and help people feel connected both to the land and to the community.Gardening also provides a steady, low impact form of exercise that is more sustainable than when exercise itself is the main goal.Lix hopes that this project will link with community groups and local primary schools so that as many people as possible can share their learning and grow things together.Growing projects like Lix’s planned one in Ardrishaig could exist all over Argyll.Crucial to this project’s success, says Lix, will be the accessibility of the project to people in the area, security of land, and a willingness from the community for it to thrive as a long-term project.If you are interested in lending a hand, oryou have any skillsto contribute, Lix would love to hear from you, so send us an email at timeforchangeargyll@gmail and we will put you in touch.If you#d like to find out more about Time for Change Argyll and Bute, email timeforchangeargyll@gmail or visit the group#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters another

chronotypes, have a genetic basis that controls one#s biological clock, but this can be modied by ious factors such as light exposure, age and lestyle.However, when the genetic and environmental cues are not aligned a chronic condition known as #social jetlag# may ensue.This problem is exacerbated during adolescence when chronotypes become increasingly delayed, but schools start early in the morning.This can cause sleep loss that may lead to major health and psychological problems and also affect academic performance.In a recent study scientists examined how the interaction between chronotype and school start time influenced inidual academic performance* by taking advantage of a high school system where  students had been randomly assigned to lessons in the morning , afternoonor evening .This enabled the unbiased testing of the effect of chronology and school schedules on academic performance in adolescents aged - years and - years.The results showed that among the early morning group, very few students got adequate sleep.The larksoutperformed owlsin all school subjects and this effect, which increased as students progressed through the school, was most extreme in maths.This outcome, however, was not evident in those having afternoon schooling, and the situation almost reversed in those receiving evening schooling, where students with later chronotypes performed slightly better in languages than the early chronotypes in the same group.Clearly academic performance is influenced by biological iation in daily rhythms, to an extent that has previously been underestimated.The study authors, while conceding that it is impractical to attempt to fully align school timetables to inidual chronotypes, suggest that it may be possible to, for example, progressively delay school start times during adolescence.* Goldin et al.  https:doi.org . s---."},{"url":null,"title":"craignish boat jumble sails back","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , :

NowA TV series will feature Mid Argyll as it follows seven celebrities on a pilgrimage through Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland.#Pilgrimage# follows the celebs # of dferent faiths and none # for  days as they follow in the footsteps of Saint Columba, seeking out his legacy as a key figure in early British Christianity, helping spread the faith from Ireland to Scotland and beyond.Along the way Will Bayley, Scarlett Moffat, Monty Panesar, Louisa Clein, Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen, Shazia Mirza and Nick Hewer enjoyed the hospitality of the people of Knapdale.They arrived in Achahoish on September  last year, having set off from Northern Ireland the previous day by boat.Tired and weary, the pilgrims were welcomed into South Knapdale Parish Church at Achahoish, where they met with some of the congregation and shared a meal.South Knapdale Parish Church Minister Reverend David Carruthers explained: #The programme#s producers # and the visitors # had caught wind of the fact that the church in Achahoish has been used previously by pilgrim groups passing through.#The Presbytery of Argyll#s youth workers have previously arranged pilgrim walks under the banner of the Columba Experience and the church at Achahoish was used for accommodation on two successive years.#After their meal at Achahoish, the group started to share with one another something of their backgrounds, beliefs and faiths whilst the TV cameras rolled.After three hours of fascinating chat, the locals went home and the travellers bedded down on the church floors in their sleeping bags.Next day the pilgrims headed northwards via Columba#s Cave near Ellary, where Father Simon MacKenzie of Christchurch in Lochgilphead conducted a short act of worship.The celebrity pilgrims began their journey in Donegal before travelling to Argyll. From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

This confirms that the timber has been grown in sustainable forests where young trees are replanted to replace the mature trees as they’re harvested.This is particularly important with hardwoods – unfortunately, there are still foreign governments who allow their rainforests to be cleared without replacing the trees that are so important for our global environment.Being a natural, organic material, part of the beauty of timber is seeing it mature. It will absorb water when it rains and dry out when the sun shines and the fibres of the timber will change, expanding and contracting as moisture levels y.Customers often worry when they see this movement but it is natural and what you’re seeing is simply part of the ageing process that all living organisms undergo. If it doesn’t affect the structural integrity of your furniture, there’s no cause for concern!The lespan of timber furniture ies greatly. Some pine benches may last a few years whilst a good teak piece can last in excess of  years. As with all furniture, much will depend on how you care for it, ensuring it doesn’t sit for prolonged periods in water, protecting it from the worst of the elements, especially over winter.Treating wooden furniture is often an aesthetic choice, whilst many customers prefer to see the timber mature naturally.Metal FurnitureAmongst the most common metals used in garden furniture are cast iron, stainless steel and aluminium. Whilst each metal may y in quality , you’ll generally find that cast iron is cheapest, with aluminium the most expensive.Cast iron tends to be very heavy and has a ‘chunky’ look, reminiscent of lovely old-fashioned garden furniture. Its weight makes it very stable in the garden but it does require maintenance to prevent corrosion as that could eventually weaken the structure.Stainless steel is lighter than cast iron and is valued for its strength, robustness, durability and resistance to corrosion.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is the second time that his term of office has been extended. His mandate was due to expire in September.In February, Norway’s government appointed Mr Stoltenberg as head of the Scandinavian country’s central bank and said it hoped he could start in his new role around December .It later said that deputy governor Ida Wolden Bache would be in charge until Mr Stoltenberg can take over.The -year-old has described Russia’s war on Ukraine as “the most serious security situation we have been in for decades”.Mr Stoltenberg has been praised for steering Nato through a dficult and isive period under the Trump administration, when the US threatened not to come to the aid of member countries that were not spending enough on defence.Speaking to reporters on an Air Force One flight to Brussels on Wednesday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that President Joe Biden “thinks very highly of Secretary-General Stoltenberg”.“They’ve developed a relationship of trust,” Mr Sullivan said. “Secretary-General Stoltenberg has played an instrumental role in helping secure the powerful unity you’ve seen at Nato through this crisis.”Mr Stoltenberg served two spells as prime minister in Norway and he also served as finance minister, and industry and energy minister."},{"url":null,"title":"p-o-admits-paying-new-ferry-workers-uk-minimum-wage  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

How do you reconcile that ”Mr Hebblethwaite replied: “Where we are governed by national minimum wage, we will absolutely pay national minimum wage.“This is an international seafaring model that is consistent with models throughout the globe and our competitors.”The ferry company boss offered no answer when Mr McDonald asked “could you sustain your lestyle ”he was paid the same as the new workers.The Labour MP added: “How do you expect them to be able to feed their families and pay their bills ” vw,vw,px, px\"PO Ferries sacked  seafarers last week and is replacing them with staff paid signicantly less Asked about what aspects of employment law the company has broken, Mr Hebblethwaite replied: “We have not consulted and for that we are fully compensating people.”He said a consultation on the new crewing model would have been “a sham” as “no union could accept it” because of the “fundamental nature of change”.He went on: “We didn’t want to put anybody through that.”Questioned on whether he was concerned he had breached his legal obligations as a company director, Mr Hebblethwaite said: “I completely throw our hands up, my hands up, that we did choose not to consult.“We did not believe there was any other way to do this.”In response to being askedhe would make the same decision again with the benefit of hindsight, Mr Hebblethwaite said: “We weren’t viable before, and I know thatwe hadn’t made radical changes the business would have closed.”The chief executive also told MPs that Transport Secretary Grant Shapps was informed on November  last year by PO Ferries’ owner DP World that the company would be changing its business model.The PA news agency understands that Mr Shapps did meet DP World chief executive Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem in Dubai on that date, but the DfT insisted he was only told the ferry operator faced challenges from competitors.A DfT spokeswoman said: “DP World did not mention to the Transport Secretary any changes it would be making to PO Ferries and there was no indication of the completely unacceptable changes it has subsequently made.” vw,vw,px, px\"Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, also appeared before the committees Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union , told MPs that PO Ferries “made flagrant breaches of the law”.He said: “They’ve done it deliberately and they’ve factored in what they’re going to have to pay for it.”He said the company is “threatening and blackmailing” its former employees, telling them they must sign a document or “you’ll potentially get no award whatsoever, and you have to give up all of your legal rights”.He added: “This is absolutely outrageous.”Mr Lynch described UK employment law as “a shambles”.Andrew Burns QC, barrister at Devereaux Chambers, told MPs “all employers with ships must give a notice to the appropriate authority  days before dismissal”.He continued: “My understanding from what I’ve been told this morning is that the notice was given to the appropriate authorities in the countries where the ships are flagged only on the day of the dismissals and not in advance.”That “appears to be a breach” of employment law, and “it may be thatare liable to a prosecution”, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"zelensky-urges-nato-provide-military-assistance-without-limitations   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The Minister announced that a more targeted approach to testing will be introduced on a phased basis from next month, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness. Testing will continue to be available for those eligible for COVID- treatments. Under the new policy, PCR testing will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop symptoms of COVID-. Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting such as a care home until the end of June, with further review then. The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June. The Health Minister stated: “The new policy reflects the new realities of the pandemic. While the prevalence of the virus remains at a high level, the risk of serious illness has been signicantly reduced - thanks in no small measure to our vaccination programme and the use of innovative COVID- treatments. “The risk posed by the virus at the present time does not justy testing and isolating large swathes of the population at the levels that we have seen to date in the past two years. Test and trace will continue to have a key role and will be used in a more focused and targeted way to support and protect our most vulnerable. This will be kept under very close review and we will have contingency plans in place so that we can scale up should it be required.” A range of changes will take effect from the  April: PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.Routine asymptomatic testingwill continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development. “As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.” The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then. Please keep following the latest public health advice as set out on NI Direct."},{"url":null,"title":"new single transfer test for p7 pupils in northern ireland to begin in","story":"Pupils in Northern Ireland will sit a single transfer test from November .

Each paper will feature English and maths questions and there will be a mixture of multiple choice and open questions.“While SEAG has advised that following a competitive tender process, GL Assessment Ltd in England have been awarded a three-year contract to provide the test, and staff have been appointed locally to oversee the administration.”Transfer tests for P pupils have been controversial, with many political parties in Northern Ireland, as well as many education experts and Northern Ireland’s commissioner for children and young people, all calling for the process to be scrapped.Sinn Fein and Alliance have called for all transfer tests to be scrapped, but the SDLP and Green Party welcomed a more streamlined option, with unionist parties remaining supportive of academic selection.Grammar schools have used a transfer test system to select new intakes of pupils since exams were first introduced in . When former Sinn Fein Education Minister Catriona Ruane announced the end of the -plus exam in November , they were quick to set up independent bodies to administer new tests on their behalf.Related topicsMichelle McIlveenDepartment of EducationMore On Michelle McIlveenPlymouth Brethren Christian Church’s schools merger plan for Northern Ireland rejected by Education Minister McIlveenEducation Minister confirms integrated status for Glengormley HighEducation Department urged to make good on promises as £m funding breakdown revealed£m for new school buildings plannedWhich  Northern Ireland schools will benefit from £m capital works programme Most ReadBBC bids to keep Donna Traynor talks out of public domainCost of living crisis: Young Belfast mum in tears over using food banks to feed familySuzanne BreenOpinionDUP faces nightmare scenarios in Assembly polls as expectations are scaled backNew IRA on its last legs, but dying wasp can still have a stingRoyal visit: Curtain call for Prince Charles at Belfast’s Grand Opera HouseTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Malawian #prophet# appears to #walk on air# in a ridiculous but hilarious videoPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportLatest EducationPlymouth Brethren Christian Church’s schools merger plan for Northern Ireland rejected by Education Minister McIlveenEducation Department urged to make good on promises as £m funding breakdown revealedSchools across Northern Ireland affected by the industrial actionViewpointOpinionVulnerable pupils collateral damagePrincipal’s plea to ‘sort it out’ as strike impacts special schoolsLatestJermain Defoe is a ‘legend’ says Bradley Lowery’s motherSunflower oil shortage sees rapeseed oil added to foods without label changesTwo to three cups of coffee a day may be good for the heart, research suggestsMeghan’s first Spoty podcast to explore labels that try to hold women backPlymouth Brethren Christian Church’s schools merger plan for Northern Ireland rejected by Education Minister McIlveen,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Christmas was particularly special, and even though she and my father-in-law Robert were pensioners, all their savings would go to the family.“She would have saved up all her coppers, silvers and pounds in a jar and there would be money for everyone at Christmas.Ms George was moved from the emergency department at the Ulster Hospital on the outskirts of east Belfast to a ward where her daughter, Roberta, was also being treated for Covid.Mr Shannon continued: “Roberta couldn’t even go and see her mum even though they were in the same ward.“She was admitted to the hospital on Monday and died on Friday.“It was the horrible and cruel way that she was taken away from us [that hurt so much]. When the ambulance drove off, little did we know there would be no contact with her again.“Roberta couldn’t even go to the funeral because she was still in hospital fighting for her le.“Sandra was left to organise everything because Roberta was so sick. She had to even choose what family and friends could attend the funeral because we were only allowed to have  people there.“That is one thing that has grieved me greatly – how do you draw up a guest list for a funeral ”Read MoreSamantha Willispassed away shortly after giving birth to her fourth childMost ReadBBC bids to keep Donna Traynor talks out of public domainCost of living crisis: Young Belfast mum in tears over using food banks to feed familySuzanne BreenOpinionDUP faces nightmare scenarios in Assembly polls as expectations are scaled backNew IRA on its last legs, but dying wasp can still have a stingRoyal visit: Curtain call for Prince Charles at Belfast’s Grand Opera HouseTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Malawian #prophet# appears to #walk on air# in a ridiculous but hilarious videoPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportLatest CoronavirusCovid-: Less than % of young kids in NI vaccinated as health professor warns of ‘serious’ long Covid riskLisa SmythOpinionTwo years on and the world is still living under the shadow of CovidWhat are the Deltacron and Stealth Omicron strains as Covid cases rise in Northern Ireland Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageOscars : Anxious wait for Covid-hit Ken Branagh and Ciaran Hinds with hopes pinned on BelfastLatestPlymouth Brethren Christian Church’s schools merger plan for Northern Ireland rejected by Education Minister McIlveenPut protections in place to stop future Speaker behaving like Bercow, MPs toldIvana Bacik confirmed as new Irish Labour Party leaderTennis ace Boris Becker’s trophies ‘auctioned off for £, to pay debts’Tyrick Mitchell hails chance of playing under Wembley arch as ‘dream come true’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She has been nominated twice for the Royal Television Society award for presenter of the year.More recently, she made cameo appearances reading news bulletins in the hit Channel  comedy Derry Girls.Announcing her departure on Twitter, she said: “It is with deep sadness that, after almost  years, I am leaving the job that I love and resigning from BBC Northern Ireland with immediate effect.“Because this is the subject of ongoing tribunal and other legal proceedings, I am not able to respond to any questions or comments about my reason for leaving the organisation.”It is thought the journalist would no longer be the first-choice presenter for the flagship Newsline programme and would also have been required to work on Radio Ulster shows. Read MoreDonna Traynor back on the BBC – but as a character in comedy Give My Head PeaceDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsMost ReadBBC bids to keep Donna Traynor talks out of public domainCost of living crisis: Young Belfast mum in tears over using food banks to feed familySuzanne BreenOpinionDUP faces nightmare scenarios in Assembly polls as expectations are scaled backNew IRA on its last legs, but dying wasp can still have a stingRoyal visit: Curtain call for Prince Charles at Belfast’s Grand Opera HouseTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Malawian #prophet# appears to #walk on air# in a ridiculous but hilarious videoPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportLatest Northern IrelandPlymouth Brethren Christian Church’s schools merger plan for Northern Ireland rejected by Education Minister McIlveenPCR testing to end for most people next monthNew single transfer test for P pupils in Northern Ireland to begin in November Charles and Camilla greeted in Waterford with Viking re-enactmentNew Northern Ireland health minister will have ‘much work to do’, says Robin SwannLatestMeghan’s first Spoty podcast to explore labels that try to hold women backPlymouth Brethren Christian Church’s schools merger plan for Northern Ireland rejected by Education Minister McIlveenPut protections in place to stop future Speaker behaving like Bercow, MPs toldPCR testing to end for most people next monthIvana Bacik confirmed as new Irish Labour Party leader,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Parents of pupils currently pay fees of between £, and £, a year depending on how many children they have enrolled.The plan would have seen the two schools, which have around  pupils between them, combine under a single principal and board of governors.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Pupils study subjects from the national curriculum and still sit qualications like GCSEs, but the school ethos is based on the Plymouth Brethren Christian faith, which dates back to .A total of  pupils currently attended the school in Knockloughrim school. It draws pupils from a catchment area stretching from Belfast to Londonderry.The Newry campus is attended by  post-primary pupils, with some travelling from the Republic.It’s understood a meeting between governors and former Education Minister Peter Weir was held in January , where he was informed of the intention to progress the merger plan for “the wider community of Christian parents and families”. The schools also educate some pupils who are not members of the Plymouth Brethren Church.“The proposal seeks to address the signicant financial burden of providing these schools on the Brethren community - schools are non-selective, either on educational ability or financial wealth of the parents,” the meeting was told.“It would see a benefit from the taxes that members of the community pay, part of which goes to DE, by receiving some funding from the government. The proposal is asking for equality in these areas. The school, while not inaccessible to all young people, will attract those who are from the faith community.”Following the rejection of the proposal, after the Education Authority and the Controlled Schools Support Council said they had a number of concerns, OneSchool Global Northern Ireland added: “Our latest inspection reports clearly recognise the value of the pastoral care in both of our campuses that allows our students to thrive, in addition to the high quality of teaching and learning that they receive.“We will reflect on the detailed report provided by the Department of Education over the coming weeks and see how we can continue to learn from feedback provided.”Related topicsDepartment of EducationMichelle McIlveenPeter WeirMore On Department of EducationNew single transfer test for P pupils in Northern Ireland to begin in November Education Minister confirms integrated status for Glengormley HighEducation Department urged to make good on promises as £m funding breakdown revealedWhich  Northern Ireland schools will benefit from £m capital works programme  PremiumRates bill for empty schools is over £kMost ReadBBC bids to keep Donna Traynor talks out of public domainSuzanne BreenOpinionDUP faces nightmare scenarios in Assembly polls as expectations are scaled backSinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan absent for almost  committee meetingsRoyal visit: Curtain call for Prince Charles at Belfast’s Grand Opera HouseWhat are the Deltacron and Stealth Omicron strains as Covid cases rise in Northern Ireland Top Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Malawian #prophet# appears to #walk on air# in a ridiculous but hilarious videoPlayMourne Mountains: Fire service tackles gorse firesLatest Northern IrelandGovernment acts to ensure availability of abortion services in Northern IrelandHow young Ken Branagh’s Radio  reading sparked interest in Belfast community and voluntary groupsPCR testing to end for most people in Northern Ireland next monthNew single transfer test for P pupils in Northern Ireland to begin in November Charles and Camilla greeted in Waterford with Viking re-enactmentLatestGovernment acts to ensure availability of abortion services in Northern IrelandHow young Ken Branagh’s Radio  reading sparked interest in Belfast community and voluntary groupsNato chief Stoltenberg to stay in post for extra yearBridgerton’s Charithra Chandran ‘so proud’ to represent South Asian populationOsprey pair reunite as female s to nest for third season,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is simply not fair on local families.Mr McGrath said a pattern was emerging whereby motorists in Newcastle sped along the Shimna Road from Donard Park and made their way up the Castlewellan Road.He urged police to get to grips with the issue to ensure people who live locally are no longer subjected to such behaviour.Cllr Devlin said the ldquoselfish actions of some drivers were not fair on residents, insisting that she and Mr McGrath will support those affected by the issue any way they can.ldquoWe shall be requesting a speed assessment of the area and asking police to consider monitoring any adverse behaviour, she confirmed.ldquoWe would appeal to local familiesthey do witness any reckless behaviour on the roads that could endanger lives to report it to police so they can gather all the necessary data..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch Camera Club competition in memory of Charlie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Camera Club members welcomed Vitorrio Silvestri, from CPA Camera Club, last Thursday night to judge the entries which had been submitted for the annual Charlie Rutledge Memorial competition.Charlie was a much loved and respected founding member of Ballynahinch Camera Club and his great passion was mono photography.After Charlie passed away in  it was decided to hold a competition each year in his memory and what other genre of photographs could such a competition attract but black and white Vitorrio gave a critique on each image and, in some cases, demonstrated how they could be improved.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

If this is the attitude adopted by the IDB then it is no wonder Northern Ireland has an extremely high unemployment rate, he added.Details of the prospective jobs boost were revealed yesterday by local Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr Gerry Douglas, who claimed the IDB has done nothing at all to assist the proposed project.DOWNPATRICK mdash The St Patrickrsquos Day celebrations in Downpatrick were a great success, according to Down Council chairman, Mr Sean Quinn.Mr Quinn said the parade was the most successful ever held in the town and he paid tribute to the organising committee and to the council officials for their hard work leading up to the event.He added that the district has been pushed to the forefront like never before, and he thanked Ulster Television for filming a week-long series of news reports from the town.ldquoWe have had a most important St Patrickrsquos Day which went down in the history of the district as one of the most successful we have ever had, said Mr Quinn.He also paid tribute to the work done by the churches and, in particular, the Church of Ireland Bishop, Dr Gordon McMullan, for his service of peace in Down Cathedral.ldquoSt Patrickrsquos Day was a wonderful coming together of the council, the community and the churches in the town, said Mr Quinn.CASTLEWELLAN mdash The Seeconnell Initiative near Castlewellan yesterday received pound.m under a major new rural development initiative.The funding was announced by the chairman of the International Fund for Ireland, Mr John McGuckian, and is aimed at helping the local initiative to regenerate what was once a thriving community.Seeconnell, close to Slieve Croob, is the first area to benefit under a new Rural Development Initiative. Mr McGuckian explained that this represents an extension to the Disadvantaged Areas Initiative which currently comprises the CERS and CRISP programmes.

The business centre would also encompass a multi-purpose meeting room.The committee, which is headed by local businessman, Mr Michael Heron, is seeking funding under the CRISP programme of the Department of Environment and the International Fund.It would act as the lsquocorersquo project to trigger other public and private sector investment in the town in areas such as upgrading footpaths, improving lighting and restoring derelict buildings.STRANGFORD mdash The Department of the Environment has been urged not to cancel a package of improvements for Strangford.The appeal was made by the chairman of Strangford Village Committee, Mr John Steenson, who said the recent decision by residents to veto plans for a new ferry jetty should not jeopardise improvements earmarked for the village.Speaking at the committeersquos annual meeting, Mr Steenson said a new, re-styled ferry terminal would be widely welcomed by residents, while a traffic scheme in the DoE car park would do much to reduce traffic congestion within the village.Mr Steenson said he was ldquogratied by the number of residents who attended the public meeting at which the improvements were discussed.ldquoThe great majority at the meeting were implacably opposed to the building of what seemed to them to be a long and unsightly jetty into the lough to act as a mooring for the two ferries, Mr Steenson remarked.ldquoAlthough there was no detailed discussion of the committeersquos suggestion that the ferry terminal be relocated outside the village, or the village by-passed by a new road, I think most people accepted, able reluctantly, that the proposal was simply not possible because of the cost, he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash Delamont Country Park, outside Killyleagh, looks set to be officially opened around Easter, it was agreed this week.Down Council is to push ahead with the opening arrangements following complaints that it has taken too long to get the prestigious project off the ground.Councillors have complained that a prime opportunity to publicise the park has been missed because it was not possible to hold an official opening when Ulster Television was filming in the district over St Patrickrsquos week.At the monthly council meeting it was also revealed that a businessman, who has opened a garden centre in Delamont, is annoyed because he was told the official opening would take place at Halloween last year.Mr John Cushnie opened his centre in July  and he claims he was given assurances by council officers that the park would officially open within four months.When the opening did not take place, Mr Cushnie went back to the councilrsquos recreation committee and only last month was told the opening ceremony would take place around St Patrickrsquos Day.Another businessman, who plans to open an exotic bird centre at Delamont, claims he has been kept waiting for firm proposals regarding the piece of land on which he needs to build the centre.ARDGLASS mdash District nursing sisters Philomena Hanna and Pauline McEvoy are continuing a tradition which dates back to the th century and Florence Nightingale.Butthe district nurse had her beginnings in Victorian Britain, she is very much a part of the late th century, having at her disposal all the skills and resources of the modern health service.Even sock there remains the fundamental commitment to the wellbeing of the community which inspired the founders more than  years ago.

After a briefto live in the south of England, Pat eventually settled in New Zealand where he spent the rest of his le.Patrsquos landscape photography is stunning and his portraits of local people are without parallel mdash they reveal a strong sense of place, identity and the character of the people.Particularly important is that most of the people have been identied.The photographs were mostly taken in the s and s, but since then the world has changed in many ways. Some of the landscapes may look the same, but buildings have gone, farming le is radically dferent and the fishing industry decimated.Cecil Newman grew up in Belfast, but from a young age enjoyed hiking and youth hostelling. He studied engineering at Queenrsquos University and joined the Royal Engineers during World War II.Whilst working in Berlin after the war to help with the processes of reconstruction, Cecil took some striking photographs of the devastated city. Some of these images were later given to the Berlin City Museum.After the war Cecil ed to work as surveyor for Belfast City Council and later as a planner in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Amongst the many high-profile projects with which he was involved were the first Newry Area Plan and the Mourne Study. Both these publications included his photographs.During the s he concentrated particularly on aerial photographs. He was a leading member of the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside and Mournes Advisory Council, often giving talks illustrated with his photographs and slides. After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

Nearing the age of , I visited the United States for the first time in my le. Prior to leaving I spoke to a few people about what to expect. A number of the conversations were startlingly similar.‘What you need to know is that you have to tip everyone in the US.’    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I have always had problems with the concept of tipping. To be clear, not the principle, but the practicality.I hate having the responsibility of having to decide how much to give, not wanting to appear either cheap or overly extravagant. I would much rather the burden is taken off me and the additional charge simply added to the service. I find myself in a taxi on the way to central Washington DC. I am telling myself over and over ‘don’t forget the tip…don’t forget the tip’.I nervously am keeping an eye on the meter. If it stays below  then should I give the driver   I have no small notes and I worry thatit goes too far in excess of  then I’m going to have to give . I arrive at the hotel and a nice man brings my heavy case to the room. I am discombobulated by the stress and strange environment. He finishes the job and smiles at me. I smile back. He smiles some more, although there may be a trace of a grimace there. ‘Oh, the tip, I’m so sorry, hang on,’ I say in a panic as I fumble with my wallet.But what is the etiquette for tipping someone who wheels my suitcase  Should I give       The trip continues with me in this constant state of uncertain anxiety. I can’t find the light switch in the bathroom and have to call for help . Do I need to tip  Breakfast in this hotel is a DIY affair and I’m trying to set the microwave for three minutes to cook an egg muffin. On my first attempt it runs for three seconds. On my second, I set it to run for three hours. A kindly woman intervenes to help. Do I need to tip  One of the porters is a corpulent and jolly fellow. Each time he sees me, he beams with enthusiasm.‘How are you today sir ’ he exclaims. I enjoy this form of good-natured banter.‘Why I’m just dandy. How are you today my good man ’ I respond gaily. ‘I am simply wonderful. You have a good day sir.’‘No, you have a good day.’ ‘No, you have a good day!’ And so it continues. But after a couple of days of this I begin to worry that I might be expected to tip him for displaying such extravagant enthusiasm and jollity. I see him in the lobby the next morning. ‘Good morning sir, how are you on this fine day ’ he begins. ‘Mmm, ok,’ I mumble, staring at the floor. I feel ashamed when I notice the hurt look in his eyes as he walks away.I struggle to sleep at night in the unfamiliar room, troubled by the ongoing pressure of delivering appropriate tips.When I do grab some moments of kip, I have unquiet dreams where the words ‘you need to tip everyone’ keep going around and around in my head.I tip the barman, the receptionist and the woman who comes to clean my room. After a while I notice that the hotel staff seem to be overly eager to lend me as much assistance as possible.I am ing to the hotel in a taxi one night when, after paying and tipping the driver, I strike my head on the corner of the car boot as I collect my belongings .Although I’m dazed, I try to pretend that nothing has happened. That is until the concierge in the lobby sympathetically points out that I have blood gushing down my face. Do I need to tip him The tipping mania continues outside the hotel. I go to a - to buy a sandwich. I pay by card and the machine asks meI want to leave a tip for %, %, % or more. I just wanted a sandwich.It is the same when I try to buy a gt for my son from a toy store. I am in the shop for just a few minutes and am tempted to hit the button on the machine which indicates no tip. However, I look up and the harsh eyes of the retail assistant are watching every move. I leave a % tip and flee.I am walking back to the hotel and struggling to get across a busy road. A driver slows down and waves me to proceed. Should I tip her A man is sitting on the pavement and asks meI have any change. I fish a few dollars out of my wallet and hand them to him. I’m about to walk on, but then I remember where I am. I take the wallet back out and give him another  cents.On this working trip one of my responsibilities is to attend an event where the US President Joe Biden will make a speech. The security is ferocious, and I have to queue for more than an hour just to get access to the grand building.When it is finally my turn, I experience the most thorough security inspection I have ever undergone. My pockets and emptied and all the contents inidually examined.My rucksack is opened and emptied. The security man turns on my laptop, presumably to ensure that it is indeed a laptop and not a bomb. I am told I am not allowed to bring my video camera into the building, and it has to be left outside.Then, he turns to my wallet. By this point in the trip I have stuffed the wallet with so many  and  notes that I cannot fasten the buckle.The security man insists on taking out the large wad of small notes and going through them all inidually to ensure that there is nothing concealed between them. This takes some time and I can hear growls of impatience and frustration from the crowd behind me.‘Gee sir, you sure do have a lot of  bills,’ the security man says.‘Well... you know, it’s for the tips,’ I say, realising immediately how stupid I sound.He continues to examine my wallet. I wonderI should tell him to just help himself to a tip.More from the News Letter: Click here: Landmark libel win: Paper Trail case against News Letter collapses with plaintfs paying towards costsClick here for more opinion and letters: www.newsletter news opinion——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Even though the devolved government was led by a thoughtful and progressive unionist leader, Brian Faulkner, that was not good enough for London.

One such moment came a year before, in March , with the murder of three Scottish soldiers, lured to the prospect of a party, at a time when squaddies were still relaxed about their security. Prior to those ‘honeytrap’ slayings the total numbers of Troubles killings was . Within  months of the murder of the young military trio, more than  people would have lost their lives. It helped cement the breach between soldiers and a nationalist population that had initially welcomed them.Direct rule set the tone for the UK approach to Northern Ireland ever since. One of general weakness in the face of the long IRA terror campaign, and towards Irish governments.Having said that, the first  years of Westminster control were overseen by both Tory and Labour governments that were robust on security and constitutional matters, compared to the time after the  Anglo Irish Agreement betrayal. It set in motion a timid approach towards Irish interference in NI affairs, something that with ministers such as Simon Coveney is at its highest levels since the s. Power at Stormont should be good for local administration but we have dysal government in which a party that wants NI to fail knows it has to be in office at all times and is allowed to behave as you would expect a party with such aspirations to behave.Collapse of Stormont : Unionism rallied when Westminster said ‘direct rule’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.– Publicly accessible Covid- testing sites will close. Local health and social care trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.– Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR.– Routine asymptomatic testing will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings, including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings.– Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.– Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.– Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.– Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June.– Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable.“After these changes are introduced from April , I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them – for examplethey are eligible for new treatments.“In the coming weeks, the department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.“The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from Covid- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic.“Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new Covid- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe.“I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance, including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”Robin SwannNorthern IrelandPCR  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDetectives call for information to help crack notorious murder case which saw Protestant minister beaten with nail-studded bats  years agoFuneral details released for popular NI businessman Ciaran McGurgan after his sudden passingUUP queries why no murders by republicans make latest list of nine legacy inquestsPICTURES: Here are  images of Charles and Camilla in BelfastMothers Day : When is Mother’s Day  Why is the date dferent in the UK and why does it change every year Most PopularBest walking shoes for women UK : ladies’ hiking shoes from Merrell, Keen, Scarpa and OnBike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for womenLEGO launch new Back to the Future DeLorean set with Marty and Doc figures for Beautul bouquets for Mother’s Day UK : the best flowers to have delivered to mum for Mothering SundayBest dog food UK : from raw, wet, to dry dog food, puppy to senior food, grain free and hypoallergenic                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It is important that the safety and security of our citizens is put first.“Freedom of movement within the Common Travel Area has only ever applied to British and Irish citizens. Seeking to widen the scope of this by stealth or pretending outrage when the UK seeks to control its own borders is uncalled for and will be seen by many for what it is, another needless attack on the UK.”In the House of Commons on Tuesday night, MPs rejected an amendment from the Lords to ditch a requirement that foreign visitors need an Electronic Travel Authorisation pass to enter Northern Ireland from the Republic. The scheme would mean non-Irish EU citizens will have to apply for online pre-travel clearance to cross the border.Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry has warned that the change in travel access would damage tourism in Northern Ireland.The North Down MP said there could be “potential legal jeopardy” because of the Government’s plan.SDLP MP Claire Hanna, who backed the Lords Amendment in the Commons, described the plan as a “terrible piece of legislation”.The South Belfast MP said it would be “unthinkable that people who call this place home would be forced to apply for a visa to travel for work or for leisure”.Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said the border travel plan “undermines the Good Friday Agrement and the Common Travel, and creates signicant restrictions on the freedom of movement on our island.”She added: “Are we really suggesting that Polish people who live and work in Lford now need papers to travel to Strabane, or from Emyvale to Aughnacloy ”Speaking after a meeting in Dublin with Brandon Lewis on Wednesday, the Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the vote to the border travel plan was “regrettable” and that Irish concerns had been ignored. The Republic still operates its own immigration spot checks on foreign nationals travelling on trains and buses from Northern Ireland into the south.Northern IrelandBrandon LewisJim AllisterMary Lou McDonaldStephen Farry  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDetectives call for information to help crack notorious murder case which saw Protestant minister beaten with nail-studded bats  years agoFuneral details released for popular NI businessman Ciaran McGurgan after his sudden passingUUP queries why no murders by republicans make latest list of nine legacy inquestsPICTURES: Here are  images of Charles and Camilla in BelfastMothers Day : When is Mother’s Day  Why is the date dferent in the UK and why does it change every year Most PopularBest walking shoes for women UK : ladies’ hiking shoes from Merrell, Keen, Scarpa and OnBike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for womenLEGO launch new Back to the Future DeLorean set with Marty and Doc figures for Beautul bouquets for Mother’s Day UK : the best flowers to have delivered to mum for Mothering SundayBest dog food UK : from raw, wet, to dry dog food, puppy to senior food, grain free and hypoallergenic                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It is the second time that his term of office has been extended. His mandate was due to expire in September.In February, Norway’s government appointed Mr Stoltenberg as head of the Scandinavian country’s central bank and said it hoped he could start in his new role around December .It later said that deputy governor Ida Wolden Bache would be in charge until Mr Stoltenberg can take over.The -year-old has described Russia’s war on Ukraine as “the most serious security situation we have been in for decades”.Mr Stoltenberg has been praised for steering Nato through a dficult and isive period under the Trump administration, when the US threatened not to come to the aid of member countries that were not spending enough on defence.Speaking to reporters on an Air Force One flight to Brussels on Wednesday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that President Joe Biden “thinks very highly of Secretary-General Stoltenberg”.“They’ve developed a relationship of trust,” Mr Sullivan said. “Secretary-General Stoltenberg has played an instrumental role in helping secure the powerful unity you’ve seen at Nato through this crisis.”Mr Stoltenberg served two spells as prime minister in Norway and he also served as finance minister, and industry and energy minister..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Nato chief Stoltenberg to stay in post for extra year article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityChief executive Peter Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told a joint session of the Commons’ transport and business select committees that the average hourly pay of the new crew is only £..He insisted that is allowed under international maritime rules.The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and above is £. per hour.Mr Hebblethwaite went on to acknowledge that PO Ferries broke employment law in how it handled the sackings.He also claimed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps knew about the intention to cut jobs in November last year, although that was strongly denied by the Department for Transport . vw,vw,px, px\"Peter Hebblethwaite answering questions in front of MPs In terms of how much the agency workers hired to replace the fired employees are being paid, Mr Hebblethwaite told MPs: “On the routes that are international routes, that are governed by ITFstandards, we are paying above ITF minimum wages.”Business committee member Andy McDonald said: “That’s below the national minimum wage of this country. How do you reconcile that ”Mr Hebblethwaite replied: “Where we are governed by national minimum wage, we will absolutely pay national minimum wage.“This is an international seafaring model that is consistent with models throughout the globe and our competitors.”The ferry company boss offered no answer when Mr McDonald asked “could you sustain your lestyle ”he was paid the same as the new workers.The Labour MP added: “How do you expect them to be able to feed their families and pay their bills ” vw,vw,px, px\"PO Ferries sacked  seafarers last week and is replacing them with staff paid signicantly less Asked about what aspects of employment law the company has broken, Mr Hebblethwaite replied: “We have not consulted and for that we are fully compensating people.”.removeHe said a consultation on the new crewing model would have been “a sham” as “no union could accept it” because of the “fundamental nature of change”.He went on: “We didn’t want to put anybody through that.”Questioned on whether he was concerned he had breached his legal obligations as a company director, Mr Hebblethwaite said: “I completely throw our hands up, my hands up, that we did choose not to consult.“We did not believe there was any other way to do this.”In response to being askedhe would make the same decision again with the benefit of hindsight, Mr Hebblethwaite said: “We weren’t viable before, and I know thatwe hadn’t made radical changes the business would have closed.”The chief executive also told MPs that Transport Secretary Grant Shapps was informed on November  last year by PO Ferries’ owner DP World that the company would be changing its business model.The PA news agency understands that Mr Shapps did meet DP World chief executive Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem in Dubai on that date, but the DfT insisted he was only told the ferry operator faced challenges from competitors.A DfT spokeswoman said: “DP World did not mention to the Transport Secretary any changes it would be making to PO Ferries and there was no indication of the completely unacceptable changes it has subsequently made.” vw,vw,px, px\"Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, also appeared before the committees Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union , told MPs that PO Ferries “made flagrant breaches of the law”.He said: “They’ve done it deliberately and they’ve factored in what they’re going to have to pay for it.”He said the company is “threatening and blackmailing” its former employees, telling them they must sign a document or “you’ll potentially get no award whatsoever, and you have to give up all of your legal rights”.He added: “This is absolutely outrageous.”Mr Lynch described UK employment law as “a shambles”.Andrew Burns QC, barrister at Devereaux Chambers, told MPs “all employers with ships must give a notice to the appropriate authority  days before dismissal”.He continued: “My understanding from what I’ve been told this morning is that the notice was given to the appropriate authorities in the countries where the ships are flagged only on the day of the dismissals and not in advance.”That “appears to be a breach” of employment law, and “it may be thatare liable to a prosecution”, he said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: PO admits paying new ferry workers below UK minimum wage article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn a video address to the Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday, Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine needs “military assistance without limitations” as Russia is “using its entire arsenal” against the country.Mr Zelensky urged Nato to provide Ukraine with “% of all your planes, % of all your tanks”.“We can’t just buy those,” Mr Zelensky added. “When we will have all this, it will give us, just like you, % security.” vw,vw,px, px\"Nato leaders are meeting in Brussels Ukraine is also in dire need of multiple launch rocket systems, anti-ship weapons and air defence systems, the president said. “Is it possible to survive in such a war without this ” he asked.Mr Zelensky said Russia used phosphorous bombs on Thursday morning, killing both adults and children.He reminded Nato leaders that thousands of Ukrainians have died in the past month,  million people have left their homes, and urged Nato to give “clear answers”.“It feels like we’re in a grey area, between the West and Russia, defending our common values,” Mr Zelenskyy said.“This is the scariest thing during a war – not to have clear answers to requests for help.”Mr Zelensky did not reiterate his request for a no-fly zone or ask to join Nato, according to a senior Biden administration official.On Wednesday evening, Mr Zelensky called on people worldwide to gather in public on Thursday to show support for Ukraine.“Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard,” he said in English during an emotional video address that was recorded in the dark near the presidential offices in Kyiv. “Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters. Ukraine matters.”Opening the emergency summit in Brussels, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance is “determined to continue to impose costs on Russia to bring about the end of this brutal war”..removeRussia unleashed its invasion on February  but instead of swtly toppling Ukraine’s government, its forces are bogged down in a grinding military campaign and its economy is labouring under punishing international sanctions.“This is a month now,” Mr Zelenskyy said on Thursday in an address to Sweden’s parliament, the latest of many to whom the Ukrainian leader has pleaded for help. “We have not seen a destruction of this scale since World War Two.”After a month of fighting, Western analysts say Ukrainian forces need stocking up again with the weapons that have helped them slow and repel Russian advances. vw,vw,px, px\"Both sides claimed on Thursday to have inflicted more blows. Ukraine’s navy said it sank a ship that had been used to resupply the Russian campaign with armoured vehicles.Russia claimed to have taken a town, Izyum, in eastern Ukraine after heavy fighting.But in many areas, Ukrainian forces appear to have battled Russian troops to a stalemate, an outcome that seemed unlikely when Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashed his invasion force.Determined to make Mr Putin change course, and under intense pressure from Mr Zelenskyy to do more, Western nations said more help is on the way for Ukraine.European Union nations signed off on another  million euros in military aid.And US President Joe Biden is expected to discuss new sanctions on Russia, along with more military aid for Ukraine, with Nato members.He will also talk to leaders of the G industrialised nations and the European Council in a series of meetings on Thursday..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Zelensky urges Nato to provide  umilitary assistance without limitations u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Minister Nichola Mallon said: “Minister Ryan and I have a shared ambition for rail and are committed to improving our network for citizens across the island through our All Island Strategic Rail Review. The public consultation phase was a vital step in delivering this important piece of work and I am delighted to have delivered this key stage. Today we met with the consultants at ARUP, along with Minister Ryan to hear the out-workings of the consultation, to understand the views of the public and stakeholders and to ensure that their priorities are a focal point of the Review as it moves forward. “With over , responses received, this highlights that this work is long overdue and has captured the imagination of the public across the whole island. In that regard, the consultation has clearly demonstrated that our citizens view decarbonisation and enhancing connectivity as key components of this Review and these factors will play a strong role as we move forward to the next stage. “Minister Ryan and I have ensured now that working in partnership the next steps will move at pace. The next phase now will see ARUP analyse the comments and feedback received to ensure that the final report fully considers the views of our citizens when published by the end of the year. “This is an exciting opportunity for people, communities and our island economy. The benefits of enhanced rail connections cross Ireland will improve lives and have signicant benefits that a better connected island could bring not just to people but also for our environment. I believe that this is our chance to deliver real and lasting change. I’m proud that in government, Minister Ryan and I have shown that working together in the interests of people works and I hope we can continue working closely to see delivery on our aspirations for all island rail.” Minister Ryan said:“I’m delighted with the progress of the All-Island Strategic Rail Review. The incredible public response has shown the importance of rail for regional accessibility and demonstrated wide support for sustainable public transport. The public and stakeholders’ ambitions for the future of passenger and freight rail transport will play a signicant role in the future work of the Review, informing concepts to enhance the rail network and, in doing so, enhance connectivity, drive decarbonisation and support sustainable social and economic development. “Minister Mallon and I are committed to increasing low-carbon mobility and regional accessibility. Through rail we can sustainably enhance connectivity to improve the quality of le for all citizens on the island of Ireland.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffebaffdacbbdded   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dceabbcfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1648027003458.jpg--ministers_welcome_report_aimed_at_producing_a_21st_century_high_street.jpg?164802700600","title":"ministers welcome report aimed at producing a st century high street ","story":"Junior Ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney have welcomed the publication of the Executive’s High Street Task Force report ‘Delivering a st Century High Street’, along with its  recommendations. The Junior Ministers, who are joint chairs of the task force, were presented with the report today by High Street Task Force members Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Seamus McAleavey, NICVA and Cathy Reynolds, SOLACE and paid tribute to the work carried out and the collaboration involved from both inside and outside of government. Junior Minister Gary Middleton said: “Our high streets have experienced constant and increasing change, particularly in recent years. “We want to empower people and communities to reshape and repurpose their local villages, towns and cities, to create a more erse high street - high streets that are clean, green, family friendly destinations that are welcoming for everyone. “I want to thank the High Street Task Force for bringing forward this report which has been developed to prioritise those actions that can drive delivery and build momentum. “A joined-up and collaborative approach must continue over the coming years to deliver high streets, village, town and city centres that are fit for the st century and this report provides the next steps for the new Ministers in the next mandate to take forward work to revitalise our village, town and city centres.” Junior Minister Declan Kearney said: “We want to see our cities, towns and villages regain and retain their vibrancy, purpose and sense of place. High streets of the future should be safe and attractive gathering points for whole communities, where people can live, work, shop, learn, do business, use public services and enjoy their leisure time. “The High Street Task Force report provides a long-term focus on addressing the transformation of our high streets and recognises that there will be a requirement for a number of short, medium and longer-term interventions. “I want to thank Task Force for their hard work and commitment to date and commend the joint-working and co-design roles played by departments, retail and other business organisations, trade unions, local councils and the community and voluntary sectors. “I believe this report and its recommendations can play a vital role in revitalising our high streets.” Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Chief Executive and Chair of the High Street Task Force – Influencing Policy and Strategy sub-group, said: “This report sets out proposals for a five year reconstruction plan for our high streets, reform of our business rates and the need to improve our retail planning policy. “We hope that an incoming Executive after the election will hit the ground running with this plan and begin the long road of recovery for our high streets.” Seamus McAleavey, Chief Executive of NICVA and member of the High Street Task Force – Developing Capacity sub-group, said: “It is obvious change is happening. We are in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it has speeded up during the Covid pandemic by necessity. Online commerce is the norm and communities need to re-invent there town centres. “Only a new vision will work as the past is the past. Communities are the heart of the city, town and villages centres. We can build vibrant high streets places people want to work in, shop in and enjoy themselves in. It is achievable.” Cathy Reynolds, Director of City Regeneration and Development, Place and Economy Department, Belfast City Council, and representing SOLACE , said: “Our high streets have experienced signicant change and challenges over recent years and it is critical that there is a focused effort to address these challenges and build on opportunities to ensure the future sustainability of our towns and cities. “A long term sustained approach is required to ensure high streets are supported to thrive and most importantly survive.” The High Street Task Force report and its recommendations will be subject to consideration by the next Executive who will determine how it can be aligned with the future Programme for Government.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffebaffdacbbdded   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dceabbcfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1640789015225.jpg--pcr_testing_to_come_to_an_end_for_most_people_from_next_month.jpg?164078901500","title":"pcr testing to come to an end for most people from next month ","story":"Testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to the COVID- pandemic over the coming months, Health Minister Robin Swann has emphasised. The Minister announced that a more targeted approach to testing will be introduced on a phased basis from next month, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness. Testing will continue to be available for those eligible for COVID- treatments. Under the new policy, PCR testing will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop symptoms of COVID-. Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting such as a care home until the end of June, with further review then. The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June. The Health Minister stated: “The new policy reflects the new realities of the pandemic. While the prevalence of the virus remains at a high level, the risk of serious illness has been signicantly reduced - thanks in no small measure to our vaccination programme and the use of innovative COVID- treatments. “The risk posed by the virus at the present time does not justy testing and isolating large swathes of the population at the levels that we have seen to date in the past two years. Test and trace will continue to have a key role and will be used in a more focused and targeted way to support and protect our most vulnerable. This will be kept under very close review and we will have contingency plans in place so that we can scale up should it be required.” A range of changes will take effect from the  April: PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.Routine asymptomatic testingwill continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development. “As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.” The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then. Please keep following the latest public health advice as set out on NI Direct.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aaaccebaecbdcedb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bafcaafedc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
