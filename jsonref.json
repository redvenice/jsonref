It’s also harder to find part-time jobs,” says Grant.The union refers students in need of emergency support to the local chaplain or the State-funded Student Assistance Fund.Fr Liam Boyle, LYIT’s chaplain, confirms that demand is up this year compared to previous years.“The accommodation issue is putting stress on students. They are travelling longer as a result, which is putting huge demands on them not just financially, but it’s physically and mentally draining facing into a long commute in the dark evenings.”At University College Dublin, demand for emergency assistance has traditionally been strongest among refugee or asylum-seeking students.This year, says the union’s president Ruairí Power, Irish students are more likely to be looking for emergency support.It has been quietly running a food voucher scheme for dozens of students who are most in need. Due to rising demand, it is in talks to set up a food bank such as UCC’s.“The students facing food insecurity tend to be those who’ve moved up to Dublin and can’t afford rent or have had to move out of accommodation suddenly, for a variety of reasons,” says Power.Over at Dublin City University, Dean O’Reilly, the union’s welfare officer, says a perfect storm is resulting in record numbers seeking financial assistance.“The delay in the release of CAO offers means first-year students had just a couple of weeks to find accommodation and, in many cases, are paying extortionate rents,” he says.“We’re also hearing of Susi grants which were delayed until recently and then the general rising cost of living … it’s no surprise to us that some students are homeless or can’t afford rent or are struggling with food.”One of the college’s societies – the Raising and Giving Society – has started its own foodbank in response to students’ needs.While there has been some critical social media commentary questioning the genuine level of need among students given the numbers socialising, O’Reilly rejects this.“The students who are looking for food need it. It’s the case that there is nothing left in the press. I’ve never known students who can afford food to go looking for it,” he says.The Government, meanwhile, says it is responding to the growing level of need through its Student Assistance Fund, which supports about 14,000 students with costs such as rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books.It says it is working closely with the Higher Education Authority on the best way to disburse the €9 million fund to inidual colleges.While the fund is a vital source of support, says Grant of LYIT, red tape means it can be several weeks before a students can get access to financial support.“The fund is important, but by the time an application is processed, it will be the Halloween break. So, students end up scraping by through anyway they can in the meantime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"waste management to be overhauled as part of move to circular economy committee told","story":"‘Meeting our climate targets requires a transformation in the way we produce and use goods,’ the committee heardTransitioning Ireland to a circular economy will have far-reaching consequences for manufacturing and lead to major changes in waste-management practices, enabling scale up of recycling and reuse of materials, the Oireachtas on Environment and Climate Action Committee has been told.Tied into a national circular economy strategy due to be announced shortly and the Circular Economy Bill 2021 will be a move to reduce food waste by 50 per cent by 2030, big reductions in construction waste and an ending of new licences for exploration and mining of coal, lignite, and oil shale.Outlining the thrust of the approach, Leslie Carberry, principal officer at the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications said the transition would replace the linear “take, make, waste” economic model with a much more sustainable one – the committee is undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.“The circular economy has the potential to significantly reduce dependency on primary resource extraction and complex global supply chains, thereby strengthening State and business resilience in the face of supply shocks,” he underlined.“Meeting our climate targets also requires a transformation in the way we produce and use goods. Therefore, making less – or making with fewer resources – will play a key role in climate action,” Mr Carberry added.The Bill would include new powers to introduce environmental levies on single-use items and to prohibit the placing on the market of environmentally harmful products, he confirmed.Waste enforcement is to be strengthened, including allowing local authorities to deploy technologies such as CCTV more widely to tackle illegal dumping and littering. The Bill will help drive better segregation of waste in the commercial sector, where EPA statistics indicate 70 per cent of the material placed in the general waste bin should be in recycling or organic bins, he said.Richard Bruton of Fine Gael underlined the immense significance of the legislation in cutting materials that have negative environmental impact from supply chains. But it needed firm targets and a budget commensurate with the challenge. That should range across the construction, retail and food sectors, he believed, backed by clear sectoral plans and timelines to deliver results.Senator Alice Mary Higgins (Ind) said that while the Bill had a strong focus on better waste management “and hope that consumers will change”, there was not enough emphasis on “reduction”, while implications for manufacturing and design must be made clearer.Senator Lynn Boylan (SF) strongly endorsed the need for statutory targets, as her experience with the introduction of the Single Use Plastics Directive had indicated “industry was unwilling to change unless forced to do so”. Ireland should follow the EU in not allowing “recovery” operations in the form of incinerators and cement kilns benefit from a new circular economy fund, she said."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

They give out non perishable items such as pasta, rice tinned foods and sauces in addition to hygiene products.Ms Walsh says it was “so upsetting” to turn needy students away. She stresses that students have indicated that once they have paid off their accommodation they find themselves low on funds to get them through the month.“There are a lot of students who come to me who really can’t afford food and that is very sad. They are spending all of their money on bills, fees and college accommodation and a lot of students just don’t have the money for food. Many students wouldn’t want to ask their parents for even more money.“Students were going in to Penny Dinners (a soup kitchen) and St Vincent De Paul and they are now coming to us. We have been blown away by the support though (since the issue was publicised on social media). People are very generous.“Caitriona Twomey from Cork Penny Dinners dropped food to us yesterday and we had students, staff members and local businesses coming in with food.”The food bank was last in place in 2019. However, Ms Walsh says far fewer students turned up looking for food two years ago.“Large numbers of students have part time jobs but are not making enough money to survive,” she says. She refutes suggestions that students have plenty of money for alcohol and then claim food poverty.“The students who came here yesterday are not the ones out partying. We are receiving donations since 10am so I will meet students who missed out yesterday. We are delighted with the response (on GoFundMe).‘Students starving’Meanwhile, Maeve Richardson, communications officer with UCCSU, warns that there are “students starving in UCC and all over Ireland”.“This is the reality of having the highest college fees in the EU and increasing rents. With the rents we have, we need either a rent freeze or a rent reduction on this island. No student can fully support themselves with a part time job.”She stresses that the majority of students who go to the foodbank have part time work and are doing everything in their power to pay for their study.Caitriona Twomey of Cork Penny Dinners soup kitchen backs the claims of Ms Richardson and says she has never seen such poverty among students.In an interview with the Opinion Line, on Cork’s 96FM, Ms Twomey said that students are presenting to their charity in large numbers for food.“UCC are addressing it and Caoimhe is doing an amazing job. I just don’t think anybody could have been prepared for yesterday. They have regrouped and have more plans. UCC have to be commended because they are rallying around.“Caoimhe has highlighted the high cost of rents. Students are doing everything and anything to keep themselves in college. They are trying to study around lectures and work.“The assistance grant needs to be increased. We need to look at the high cost of rent. College can stretch a family way beyond their limits.“The students don’t want to be saying they don’t have enough to eat because their families are already strapped. This is not unique to UCC. It is not because they are not budgeting properly. They may not have the money to budget with.”Ms Twomey added that people who want to go to college should receive every assistance from the State.“Years ago college would have been off limits for a large numbers of families. It isn’t now. But things have crashed down around a lot of people for a number of reasons. They need the help now,” she said.“We have students who volunteer in Penny Dinners. They give what they can and of their time. Sometimes we end up feeding them. Having them work on an empty stomach isn’t right. We see what people don’t see.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireThe SDLP is to accept an invitation to a cross-community church service in Armagh marking the centenary of partition and the formation of Northern Ireland. The party leader, Colum Eastwood, said that attending a service in the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland “does not diminish anyone’s Irish nationalism” but he hoped it would “help to break down the barriers of distrust that have endured between our communities.” He said he understood this would be a “challenging decision for some, and others have come to a different determination.” It is not clear who will attend on behalf of the SDLP but it is expected to be a senior party representative. The DUP and the Ulster Unionist and Alliance parties confirmed to The  on Thursday that their respective party leaders Jeffrey Donaldson, Doug Beattie and Naomi Long had received invitations to the service, and would attend. Last month the President declined an invitation from the five main Christian churches to attend the event, as he believed the title was politicised and it would not be appropriate for him to attend. The church leaders have insisted the event is not political. The Government is expected to approve plans on Thursday to send a cross-party delegation to the service. It is due to be held in the Church of Ireland cathedral in Armagh on October 21st. Sinn Féin has consistently said it will not attend. The party on Thursday said it stood by comments outlined by chairperson and Junior Minister in the Northern Executive Declan Kearney at an event organised by the churches in Belfast last month, which he described as a “welcome opportunity which afforded Sinn Féin a platform, and also those from other perspectives, to present their analysis and experience of partition in Ireland”. “I made it clear to the churches that Sinn Féin would not be attending the Armagh event as unfortunately it does not afford the same opportunity to address the legacy of partition, which has been a disaster for the people of this island.” Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Thursday it would be “wrong” for the Government to send a representative to the service. In a statement on Thursday the SDLP leader said partition and commemoration were “deeply political events”.“I fully understand why it was not possible for President Higgins to attend the event in Armagh. As President of Ireland he has different considerations to judge,” he said, adding that Mr Higgins had “dedicated himself and his presidency to reconciliation and understanding between our communities”.However, he said his party’s decision to attend was “about stretching ourselves to heal the wounds of partition. “It is about reaching beyond ourselves and reaching out to people from a different tradition, many of whom are considering a new future for our island for the first time. “My job as a leader of nationalism is to speak to them, to hear their concerns and to convince them that change is possible,” he said.

The white stucco-fronted house across the street from the Natural History Museum in south Kensington looks much like its handsome mid-19th\u0026nbspcentury neighbours with cast iron railings and Doric porch. But 5 Cromwell Place, the home of the painter John Lavery and his wife Hazel, was at the centre of events during Treaty negotiations 100 years ago this month.It was here that Lavery painted portraits of the two delegations, including Michael Collins, Arthur Griffith and Éamon de Valera on the Irish side and David Lloyd George, Winston Churchill and FE Smith, Lord Birkenhead, on the British. Lavery gave the pictures to the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin when Hazel died in 1935 but they are now on display in London for the first time in “The Art of Negotiation”, an exhibition at the Irish Embassy to mark the centenary of the Treaty.“It’s quite unusual to have a suite of visual art that is a central historical account of a momentous time,” Hugh Lane Gallery director Barbara Dawson told me as she and curator Logan Sisley gave the exhibition a final once over before the opening.Born in Belfast in 1856, Lavery was orphaned at a young age and raised by relations before moving to Scotland where he studied. Thanks to royal patronage, he became a celebrated portraitist of early 20th\u0026nbspcentury London society before marrying Hazel, a wealthy Chicago widow who was herself an artist.Lavery was celebrated not only for his skill as a painter but for his gift for capturing features that expressed their character. Apart from society portraits, he painted major works documenting the course of modern Irish history, including the appeal of Roger Casement in 1916. Birkenhead led the prosecution of Casement for treason and George Gavin Duffy, one of the Irish negotiators Lavery painted, defended him.It was Hazel who prompted Lavery to paint the Treaty negotiators in 1921 after she encouraged him to “do something for your country”. He painted all the Irish negotiators in 1921 and their British counterparts a year or two later, or in Churchill’s case a few years earlier.“We know Lavery was a superb portraitist, his manipulation of paint and his incisiveness in managing to capture the erse personalities of these men who were really erse in background and were just united in one common goal that was achieving a treaty with Britain. I think that Lavery managing to capture these erse personalities in such a short space of time was truly incredible,” said Dawson.The Art of Negotiation is part of a series of Embassy events in London to commemorate the Treaty and at its opening on Thursday evening Ambassador Adrian O’Neill said its purpose is “to deepen our understanding of this period of our shared history”.The Treaty 1921: Records from the ArchivesNext week, the Embassy and\u0026nbspNational Archives of Ireland will bring another exhibition “The Treaty 1921: Records from the Archives” to London for display in the British Academy at Carlton House Terrace. It will use primary sources from the national archives and records from other institutions to map the events that led up to the Treaty negotiations and to give new insights into the recollections of the delegates.In December, the Embassy\u0026nbspwill host a number of performances of The Treaty, a new play from playwright Colin Murphy and Fishamble Theatre Company, that tells the story of what happened inside the negotiations.All of these events take place as Ireland is again at the centre of a British negotiation, this time with the European Union over the Northern Ireland protocol. Dawson believes that the Lavery portraits resonate down the years with an insight about the nature of negotiations and what makes them work.“I think they speak to us about a humanity,” she said.“You see here statesmen, you see dignity, you see humanity. And for me, it just reflects the fact that negotiation, collaboration is really the only way to achieve results, to achieve peace, to achieve reconciliation or resolution.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"appointment sea lord head armed forces shows navy has become","story":"The British public was always going to be well served no matter which candidate for the job of Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) got the nod.All the front-runners were erudite, resourceful and respected men. (They were all still men, though, but the years of a male-only shortlist are surely numbered.) However, in what Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, likes to call the Game of Thrones, the selection of Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the First Sea Lord, goes beyond primus inter pares.Britain’s military strategy, for the next decade at least, will focus on the Royal Navy and the “tilt” to the Indo-Pacific. That is not to deny the relative capabilities of the other services (although the Army, in particular, faces big problems with re-capitalisation). It is also not a blinkered obeisance to the two new aircraft carriers, impressive as they are. It is, instead, an acknowledgement that Britain aspires to a greater role in world affairs after two decades pursuing the chimera of liberal intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. That requires a maritime strategy, incorporating, but not limited to, the military. The Government’s recent Integrated Review (IR) of defence, security and foreign policy pointed Britain in this new direction.Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy in East Asia at King’s College London, said at its heart the IR sees state-on-state competition as “the fuel behind international relations”.That matters to the Government because it is the current thinking in Washington.“If we’re serious about being forward-leaning, we need to use the maritime space as a launching pad for engaging with others,” Mr Patalano said. “The Navy is part of the broader tools of statecraft.”The Government views the Indo-Pacific region as the key area to shape future global competition, important in resisting China’s attempts to undermine the international rules-based order.Military power, as a tool of the statecraft needed to meet these challenges, will be designed in the medium term to bolster the threat from states, not terrorists.The Navy will play a central role in making Britain’s Armed Forces more mobile, forward-deployed and engaged with allies.It’s about “places not bases” and exercising in new areas. In short, turning up and being seen by allies to care about the region. As one US general put it, “virtual presence means actual absence”. Adm Radakin’s stewardship of the Royal Navy chimed with the Government’s desire for a renewed British military presence around the world.The forging of new partnerships through the ongoing deployment of the Carrier Strike Group to the Indo-Pacific region is a practical example of Britain’s new military posture.Adm Radakin’s personality is suited to furthering that strategy.In an interview with the Wavell Room, a military think tank, he described himself as inquisitive, keen to learn and curious about the world. He said optimism was “a fundamental trait of leadership”.These characteristics will be tested by a revanchist and belligerent Russia in Europe and a perpetually (perhaps willingly) provoked China in the east. “It feels to me that it is hard to be a pessimistic leader,” Adm Radakin said. He said even if a situation looked grim it was a leader’s responsibility to say “this is a noble and selfless thing to do, and we’re going to do it”.His tenure as CDS could well be judged on those words.More from Newspolitan Police worst force for solving sexual and violent crimeIn Liz Truss, Boris may have created a force more powerful than he realises‘I am not perfect’ says Insulate Britain protester after photos emerge of 10,000-mile holidayProtesters destroy pro-life stand at Oxford University freshers’ fairMedical student used fat suit to disguise himself as woman and attack ex-girlfriend with acidYou must know how to be impartial, BBC tells applicants for top news jobMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"council accused creating vaccine apartheid among schoolchildren","story":"A council has been accused of enabling “vaccine apartheid” in schools after becoming the first to introduce new self-isolation rules for unvaccinated children.Suffolk County Council has told parents that if their children have not been vaccinated, they will have to stay at home for up to a week if one of their siblings tests positive for Covid.Meanwhile, children who have been vaccinated will be allowed to continue attending school as normal after a sibling tests positive.It is one of a number of councils which has told children to isolate if a sibling tests positive – even though this contradicts national guidance, which says pupils should be off school only if they test positive for Covid-19 themselves or are showing symptoms.But Suffolk is believed to be the first council to introduce different rules for vaccinated and unvaccinated children.Officials at the Department for Education (DfE) told The  that they have contacted Suffolk County Council to “emphasise the importance of children being in school whilst waiting for a PCR test result”.They said that if there are high Covid case rates in a school, local directors of public health may advise that additional measures are introduced but added that face-to-face education “should be prioritised”.Arabella Skinner, a director of the parent campaign group UsForThem, said the decision introduced “clear discrimination” against children who have not been vaccinated.She added: “It is profoundly upsetting to see that vaccine apartheid is being introduced in our classrooms. The Education Secretary urgently needs to guarantee that no child is discriminated against or excluded from an equal education based on their vaccination status.”This week, Stuart Keeble, Suffolk’s Director of Public Health, said additional measures in schools were “necessary” to control the spread of the virus.He explained that if a sibling had tested positive, children should self-isolate for three days, then get a PCR test and wait for the results – which could take another three days – only returning to school if they have a negative result.However, parents were told that children were “exempt” from this advice if they had been vaccinated or if they had already tested positive within the past 90 days.One parent said: “I think Suffolk Council is being completely hysterical. They never seem to consider the other side, which is the damage being done to children’s education. Meanwhile adults can go to the pub and do what they like. It’s just absurd and really infuriating.”Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, has previously said that no child should be “stigmatised” if they are not vaccinated.He said on Thursday that schools will not reintroduce the policy of bubbles to protect against coronavirus, but could see a return of face masks.“I don’t want to return to bubbles because, actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children,” he told Sky News.He said that there were contingency plans in place to keep schools open if there is a rise in cases, adding that this “absolutely” includes the return of face masks.Suffolk is one of a handful of councils – including Cumbria county council – which has introduced self-isolation measures for children whose siblings have tested positive.Wigan council’s director of public health has introduced a “suite of measures” after a rise in cases at a local school, including face masks in the classroom and asking siblings of children who test positive to isolate.Mr Keeble said the measure has been implemented on a “temporary” basis to reduce the spread of Covid and “ultimately, keep more children in school”.He added: “The advice means that a relatively small number of children will only have to stay at home for four days, rather than a larger number of children potentially catching Covid and having to self-isolate for 10.“This obviously reduces the number of school hours impacted. This only applies to schools deemed to have a Covid outbreak and all of our measures remain under constant review.”A DfE spokesperson said: “Self-isolation of close contacts – including siblings – is no longer required, and pupils can attend school unless they have symptoms or a positive test result. We strongly encourage all close contacts to take a PCR test, and older students and staff to continue regular twice-weekly lateral flow testing.“The protective measures in place in schools strike a balance between managing transmission risk – with enhanced ventilation, regular Covid testing and vaccinations of older students and staff – and reducing disruption to education by removing the need for close contacts in bubbles to self-isolate and for face coverings to be worn in most cases.”More from Newspolitan Police worst force for solving sexual and violent crimeIn Liz Truss, Boris may have created a force more powerful than he realises‘I am not perfect’ says Insulate Britain protester after photos emerge of 10,000-mile holidayProtesters destroy pro-life stand at Oxford University freshers’ fairMedical student used fat suit to disguise himself as woman and attack ex-girlfriend with acidYou must know how to be impartial, BBC tells applicants for top news jobMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive governments switch greener fuel major factor behind","story":"The Government’s switch to greener petrol last month was a “major factor” behind the fuel crisis that saw forecourts across the country run dry, industry chiefs have revealed.Retailers said they had already been “emptying their tanks as fast as we could” for the switchover to E10 petrol when a sudden surge in panic buying quickly drained their remaining stocks.According to official figures released on Thursday, fuel deliveries to petrol stations remained steady over the summer and throughout most of September despite warnings of a slowdown caused by a shortage of HGV drivers.Yet the amount of spare fuel stored at forecourts fell sharply by up to a quarter after Sept 1, when the Government introduced greener E10 fuel as the standard unleaded petrol.When motorists began panic buying on Sept 24, garages across the country found they did not have enough in their storage tanks to keep up with demand.Brian Madderson, the chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said the data showed that the fuel crisis had been an “unintended consequence” of the Government’s switch to greener petrol.“For weeks we had been emptying our tanks of E5, the old fuel, as fast as we could to get ready for E10. We had all run our petrol stocks down,” Mr Madderson said.“So when the panic buying started, many of our members ran out pretty quickly. Then the shortage of HGV drivers meant we couldn’t get supplies of petrol or diesel quickly enough.“I don’t blame the Government particularly but the E10 switchover clearly had an unintended consequence: we couldn’t cope with the surge in demand.”Ministers rolled out E10, which is blended with a minimum of 5.5 per cent biofuel, as the standard unleaded petrol from Sept 1. Previously the regular unleaded was E5, although E10 has been on sale for some time in the UK and many European countries. The move was an interim step to help the UK reach its target of net zero emissions by 2030.Mr Madderson said some smaller petrol stations had been in the process of switching their storage facilities when the crisis hit because E10’s higher ethanol content can burn through rubber.“That can take time,” he said.Many fuel retailers including Asda have opted to sell only E10 at their sites. BP has said only some sites will be selling E5, while 200 of Esso’s 1,200 petrol stations are no longer selling the old grade.According to the figures released on Thursday by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy, deliveries for road fuel remained steady throughout the summer, averaging around 16,000 litres of petrol and diesel per station each day from mid-June to the end of August.This constant supply meant that pump stock levels hovered at 40 per cent full, at most rising or falling by one or two percentage points in the same period.Yet from Sept 1 onwards, forecourts across the UK began to see a steady and pronounced decline in fuel stocks, even before the shortages burst into public attention. By Sept 16 – a week before panic-buying began – average stock levels had fallen from 40 per cent to 34 per cent. By Thursday Sept 23 – the day of a notorious leaked BP warning that supplies were running low due to a lack of HGV drivers – stock levels were already at 32 per cent.London and the East of England in particular saw the sharpest pre-panic-buying declines, with stock levels falling by more more than a quarter between Sept 1 and Sept 23.It was not until Friday, Sept 24 that the stock crisis snowballed, with demand more than doubling. Having remained constant throughout the summer, daily road fuel sales lept from around 15,000 litres per station in the week prior to Sept 24 to more than 35,000 on the Friday.By Saturday, Sept 25, pumps across the country were empty, with average road fuel stocks reaching a daily low of 15 per cent full.According to a PRA survey, 12 per cent of filling stations in London and the South East were still dry on Thursday, while 17 per cent had just one grade of fuel. Around 90 per cent of forecourts outside London and the South East had both grades available.RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said shortages have been most keenly felt by smaller retailers who don\u0027t tend to buy fuel as frequently.He added: Following the recent rush on the pumps, the vast majority of retailers needed to replenish their stocks at the same time which put enormous stress on supply chains.A Department for Transport spokesperson said: There is no evidence to suggest that the introduction of E10 was related to the fuel shortage. The fuel issues we have seen in recent weeks were caused by an unprecedented spike in demand caused by atypical consumer behaviour.The legislation that the Government put in place to introduce E10 allows fuel retailers to still use existing stocks until 1 November as part of a gradual change, so there was no need for the emptying of storage tanks. This timeframe was extensively discussed and agreed with stakeholders.E10 petrol contains up to 10 per cent ethanol, double the level in the type previously commonly used in the UK, E5.It was introduced at the start of September by the Government in a bid to make driving more eco-friendly. The ethanol in the fuel is made from natural sources like grains, rather than the petroleum oil that makes up the bulk of the fuel used in cars which run on petrol or diesel.This means lower emissions, because the process of growing the crops also removes carbon from the air.The Government says the switch could cut carbon dioxide emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year, the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the roads in the UK.Critics are concerned about the land use involved in using food to make fuel and argue that the process of growing the crops may not actually offset the emissions released when the fuel is burned.The change also does not solve the problem of air pollution from vehicles and its impact on people\u0027s health.Drivers may get fewer miles to the gallon with E10 petrol. The Government says drivers may see a reduction of around one per cent but it is unlikely to be noticeable in everyday driving.For the typical UK car which does 49.2 miles per gallon, this would mean a fall to 48.7, though some drivers have reported larger drops.It can be used in over 90 per cent of the cars on UK roads, but it\u0027s not recommended for use in some classic cars and lawnmowers.Ethanol is a solvent so it can damage rubber, plastic and fibreglass parts.  The ethanol in the fuel also attracts water, causing the engine to become contaminated which leads to corrosion issues.This is particularly an issue if a car is left to sit with the fuel inside it for long periods, which is more common for classic cars which may only be driven rarely.More from Newspolitan Police worst force for solving sexual and violent crimeIn Liz Truss, Boris may have created a force more powerful than he realises‘I am not perfect’ says Insulate Britain protester after photos emerge of 10,000-mile holidayProtesters destroy pro-life stand at Oxford University freshers’ fairMedical student used fat suit to disguise himself as woman and attack ex-girlfriend with acidYou must know how to be impartial, BBC tells applicants for top news jobMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"giving spelling betrayal young","story":"In a letter intended to cheer up Thomas Cromwell as he set about dissolving monasteries, one of his heavies, Richard Leighton, not a nice man, likened Langdon Abbey in Kent to a rabbit warren – “evyn lyke a cony clapper fulle of startying hoilles”. Hoilles are holes, through which the coneys (rabbits) might start suddenly and make a break for it.Leighton, a Cambridge man and a doctor of law, was not tremendously good at spelling. It’s uphill work reading his prose. But no one was a good speller in the 1530s. Only by the constant pressure of printers ironing out discrepancies did English spelling become regularised. For most words there is now an agreed spelling – but with what a glorious hotch-potch (or is it hodge-podge?) of arbitrary forms! Never mind cough, dough, thought and through, every sentence groans like an autumn oak with a heavy crop of unphonetic and unnecessary letters.Every word has its own history. That’s good. Many show how vowels were pronounced before the 14th century. Others are the work of classicisers wanting scissors, for example, to wear a Latin toga as though it came from scindere. We could tear up the dictionary and start again with a logical phonetic system, as the Spanish did. But if we did, all old books would be closed to ordinary readers. Dickens would be as heard to read as Chaucer.Why then do universities think it doesn’t matter how students spell or use grammar? Things are so bad that the Office for Students quango wants to slap down universities that “ask academics to ignore poor spelling, punctuation and grammar”. This can “undermine standards” – and the confidence employers have in the value of a degree. An insidious notion is that spelling is elitist, even racist. “The idea that they should expect less from certain groups of students is patronising,” says Susan Lapworth at the OfS.Two things are going on at once here. One is that pupils from Bash Street schools are not expected to have high standards because they have had less chance to learn grammar formally and less chance to read books (which are deemed by patronising authorities  not to exist for the Children of Grime in their high-rise, gang world). The other is that bad spelling has actually become a flag of working-class culture. By the deranged weapon of intersectionality, class war attempts to set the poor, the ignorant and ethnic minorities against the rich, public-school white elite. By false logic, to display good spelling  is to choose the wrong side. It’s as bad as joining the Bullingdon Club. “Which side are you on?” sang Peter Seeger and his worker allies. No young people listen to Pete Seeger, but know-nothing theorists use them as cannon-fodder even so.Ignoring spelling is in truth to betray the young who seek education because they are interested in the world and its ideas. They wouldn’t mind a job, either, after university, and they won’t get one if they can’t spell and put together a grammatical sentence or two in their CVs.It so happens that spelling is historically a shibboleth in British culture. In that way it is like dress. Young people are also betrayed by being denied the concept of smart clothing. You see it at funerals, where grandchildren of the departed have no shoes to wear, only trainers, no jackets, only hoodies, no dresses, only jogging-bottoms. Perhaps the young now have the last laugh on fashion by choosing to have their hair cut neatly it is the generation of their university tutors who still slop around with an ill-kempt, lank shambles of a haircut.More fundamentally spelling is as important to university study as the periodic table is to a chemist or basic equations are to physicists. It’s both a matter of knowledge and of skill: one false move and these tools don’t work.And it’s not as though people in their late teens aren’t already capable of using at least two registers of language – one for their friends at school or on the street corner and one for formal use in webinars or job interviews.Education is a way of escape from poor housing, terrible neighbours, frightening gangs, dreary jobs, Universal Credit and a rocky family life. These are the successors of the  Five Giants that Beveridge hoped in 1942 would be slain by the Welfare State – idleness, ignorance, disease, squalor and want. Youngsters cannot break the new Giants’ baneful spell without learning to spell.More from Newspolitan Police worst force for solving sexual and violent crimeIn Liz Truss, Boris may have created a force more powerful than he realises‘I am not perfect’ says Insulate Britain protester after photos emerge of 10,000-mile holidayProtesters destroy pro-life stand at Oxford University freshers’ fairMedical student used fat suit to disguise himself as woman and attack ex-girlfriend with acidYou must know how to be impartial, BBC tells applicants for top news jobMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"job needed navy man admiral sir tony radakin perfect choice","story":"The announcement that Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the current First Sea Lord, is to become the next Chief of Defence Staff is splendid news for defence and the nation. He is a highly competent and experienced officer who has shown a willingness to challenge shibboleths within the Navy and defence establishment.It is also timely, as the Senior Service has not held the post for almost 20 years. More importantly, a naval officer is appropriate in the context of the Government shifting defence back to a primarily maritime strategy in foreign policy terms, implementing “Global Britain”.For the first two decades of this century, we have involved ourselves in nation-building in central and western Asia, so one could argue that the preponderance of Army Chiefs of Defence made sense. Such a strategy, however, was out of our comfort zone and has not been a happy story.We often forget as a nation that we still run global shipping from London. We rely on the 95 per cent by volume of trade that enters and leaves our country by sea. We remain the largest European investor in South Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific rim, with huge benefits to our balance of payments. We are responsible for the defence and security of 14 dependencies worldwide and have only relatively recently established some of the world’s largest nature conservancy zones around them. Global stability is crucial not just for our wealth but that of nations worldwide and the Royal Navy has a history of providing that stability.The decision in the Integrated Review to base our defence and security on a maritime strategy was correct and welcome. As you can imagine, it was music to my ears to have the Prime Minister say on the floor of the House: “If there is one policy that strengthens the UK in every possible sense, it is building more ships for the Royal Navy” and that we should become the “foremost naval power” in Europe. If that is our nation’s aim then a naval officer is best placed to ensure it happens. And there is still much to do. The shipbuilding strategy needs to be refined and pursued with vigour. The UK still has a shameful shortage of frigates. Radakin has shown that he is willing to challenge the procurement processes in the Ministry of Defence and has been at the forefront of trialling and developing radical unmanned systems for the future. He has cut the number of admirals and restructured manpower so that more men and women are serving at sea which is where naval personnel should be.In terms of Global Britain, he has been a driving force behind the Carrier Battlegroup deployment to the Pacific. Despite its critics this has been a great success. Our allies in the region are delighted to see such a concrete example of commitment to freedom of passage and regional stability.The Americans are particularly pleased that such an old ally is operating alongside them in the region and have bent over backwards to support the group. The ships have exercised and operated with Nato and other allies in the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, the South China Sea and the Pacific. In strategic foreign policy terms it has quietly re-affirmed the right of all nations to exercise innocent passage through such areas as the Taiwan Straits and South China Sea.The innate flexibility of sea-power is demonstrated by the fact that the group is now heading back into the Indian Ocean and will soon be in Nato’s backyard available for a multitude of tasks. Such tasks could range from patrolling north of the Greenland-Iceland-UK gaps to confront Russian sabre rattling, countering drug and people smuggling in the Caribbean, and combating piracy in the Gulf of Guinea or reassuring the Falkland Islands that we haven’t forgotten them.Despite what people may say, the UK remains a great global power, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the fifth richest country in the world, is responsible for a vast tract of ocean and seabed and is a focus for global shipping. The need for a powerful navy and UK shipbuilding programme is recognised by government and opposition alike and at this crucial time a first-class naval officer is just what is needed to head up defence. Admiral Radakin is just such a man. More from Newspolitan Police worst force for solving sexual and violent crimeIn Liz Truss, Boris may have created a force more powerful than he realises‘I am not perfect’ says Insulate Britain protester after photos emerge of 10,000-mile holidayProtesters destroy pro-life stand at Oxford University freshers’ fairMedical student used fat suit to disguise himself as woman and attack ex-girlfriend with acidYou must know how to be impartial, BBC tells applicants for top news jobMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"liz truss boris may have created force powerful realises","story":"For an American pollster, Frank Luntz has long held an unusual amount of influence over British politics. He once convened a focus group in the Churchill Room of the Carlton Club which identified the then-outsider David Cameron as the next Tory leader – his experiment was televised and transformed the debate. So when Luntz joined a Spectator panel at Tory conference earlier this week, I asked him to test the mood of the audience: if not Boris, then who? To my surprise, the clear answer was Liz Truss.For some time now, Rishi Sunak has been seen as the obvious alternative. He has been the bookmakers’ favourite since he responded so quickly to the pandemic with a furlough scheme that has become the envy of countries such as the United States.Now, Sunak is the face of tax rises. He had to spend his time at Tory conference explaining why higher National Insurance is better than higher national debt. He’s right, but both options are resented by his party. Things might get worse yet, with the Prime Minister refusing to rule out more taxes.No such worries haunt Liz Truss, who spent Tory conference revelling in her new status as Foreign Secretary and posing for selfies with her army of admirers.They see her as refreshing, entertaining, perhaps a bit naughty – but, at heart, a Conservative who actually believes in conservatism at a time when others, when tested, have faltered. To find where she was speaking at Tory conference, you just needed to look for the rooms with the longest queues. To many, she is the keeper of the Thatcherite flame (she had a lifesize cutout of the former prime minister at one birthday party).The Lizmania will sound absurd to those Tories who see her as a trivial Instagram poseur with a weakness for innuendo and pop music references. She is certainly more likely to quote Destiny’s Child than Homer.A few days ago, she toasted an Australian trade deal by saying that the new partnership would bring the countries “even closer” than “the great romance between Kylie and Jason” on Neighbours. At a party thrown by free-market think tanks, she said she had come “to be reinfected with a bit of sound thinking”. Tory activists lap all of this up, loving her general tone of cheeky insurgency.There will be no revolution, no coup and no vacancy. Conservatives like power and will follow anyone who brings it: Boris Johnson personally won over Northern voters and without him they’d be sunk, even now. So the party faithful applaud when he says that higher taxes were needed after the “meteorite” of Covid.But they know the other meteorite is Johnson’s own decision to finance the nursing home costs of wealthy families – thereby forcing taxes to a 70-year high. From choice, not necessity.“Did we really go through all of this to become a high-spending European social democracy?” asks one minister. A fair point, and it explains why Truss backed Remain. She said at the time that Brexit was a distraction from her goal of lower taxes and a more free society. Brexiteers were naive, she thought, to think all of this would inevitably follow leaving the EU. She may yet be proved right. But she was strategic enough to keep very quiet during the campaign: now, she’s a born-again Brexiteer.She has also kept up her own fights inside government, to the further delight of her fans. Dominic Raab was asked during the Tory conference why, as a self-identifying low-tax Tory, he won’t use his Cabinet influence to argue against the splurges. What’s said in Cabinet tends to leak, he replied.He’s right, which is why history records that Truss was one of the few voices to confront the Prime Minister over the National Insurance increase. Better to load the national debt and rely on growth, she argued, than weigh the economy down with tax rises and renege on a manifesto pledge.This isn’t the first time Johnson has disappointed her on tax. When she joined his leadership campaign she brought with her a plan to ensure no one would pay the higher-rate threshold until they earned £80,000 (up from £50,271). Johnson was all for it at first, but then changed his mind. It’s not hard to imagine how the crowd in Manchester this week would have lapped up this idea. Even now Truss can give them a wink and suggested that, if she had her way, it might yet happen.Her other conflicts have brought her up against agricultural protectionists, who her allies jokingly refer to as the “axis of evil”. Members tend to include Michael Gove, George Eustice and Zac Goldsmith.These are the so-called Waitrose Tories, who stand in contrast to Truss’s Lidl Tories who want free trade and low prices. This has become a Truss trademark: she likes doing things on a budget.Being the heir apparent is usually a curse in the Tory party. Sunak will not have enjoyed this status: it means his every word (and any resistance he puts up to No 10) would have been scanned for Blair-Brown style rivalry. He’d doubtless be delighted to see the spotlight move to Truss, who would bask in it.In many ways, she is Johnson’s creation. He likes her boosterism, remembers her early support for him and has kept her safe from jobs where she would have to put her low-tax ideals to the test (or, as in Sunak’s case, to the slaughter).But some around him are beginning to wonder if he might have created a force more powerful than he realises. When she accompanied him on his recent trip to New York, just days into her role as Foreign Secretary, she waited for a clear run and walked down the runway red carpet with a confidence that unnerved some in No 10. “Those kinds of photos are supposed to be reserved for the Prime Minister,” said one of his allies.It’s too much to say that Johnson has created a rival. But there will be hard times ahead for him, especially if a cost-of-living crisis this winter forces him to adopt a more sombre tone. He may well find that, if this happens, there is someone ready and primed to take over as optimist-in-chief.More from Newspolitan Police worst force for solving sexual and violent crime‘I am not perfect’ says Insulate Britain protester after photos emerge of 10,000-mile holidayProtesters destroy pro-life stand at Oxford University freshers’ fairMedical student used fat suit to disguise himself as woman and attack ex-girlfriend with acidYou must know how to be impartial, BBC tells applicants for top news jobUS special forces and marines secretly operating in Taiwan to train local military forcesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"natwest admits money laundering offences","story":"NatWest has become the first high street bank to admit money laundering offences after allowing a small jewellery firm in Bradford to deposit hundreds of millions of pounds in cash over a three-year period.The bank, which is still more than half-owned by the taxpayer, now faces fines that could top £300 million, following a lengthy investigation into its dealings with Fowler Oldfield Ltd, a bullion dealer and jewellery business, which had its headquarters on an industrial estate in West Yorkshire.The company, which can trace its origins back to a jewellery stall in Bradford in 1897 and had been a familiar fixture in the city’s high street for more than a century, was closed in 2016 following a police raid.Fowler Oldfield, which specialised in bullion dealing, had a predicted annual turnover of £15 million a year, but deposited £365 million, including £264 million in cash over a three-year period.At one stage, the company was depositing £1.8 million a day, but NatWest failed to monitor and prevent the alleged money laundering.A total of 15 people with connections to the Bradford business have been charged in relation to the alleged laundering offences.A number of other people have also faced criminal charges after being accused of acting as couriers to move cash around the country.Among those who are due to go on trial next year at Leeds Crown Court are James Stunt, the bullion dealer who used to be married to the Formula One heiress, Petra Ecclestone.His Mayfair offices were raided by police in 2016 shortly after the Fowler Oldfield investigation was launched.Gregory Frankel, the great-grandson of the founder of the Bradford jewellery firm, is also awaiting trial.Mr Frankel, who was a director of Fowler Oldfield, was also vice president of Stunt \u0026amp Co. He and Mr Stunt also had a joint venture which sold gold and silver bullion on the international markets.The investigation into NatWest’s handling of the deposits by Fowler Oldfield was led by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).It is the first time a financial institution has been prosecuted under anti-money laundering laws in the UK.The bank, which was rescued by the taxpayer in a £45 billion bailout during the financial crash in 2008, admitted three offences under the Money Laundering Regulations of 2007, namely that it had failed to adequately monitor a customer’s account between 2012 and 2016.Clare Montgomery QC, prosecuting, told Westminster Magistrates’ Court that the firm’s deposits far outstripped the size of business.She said: “The turnover of Fowler Oldfield was predicted to be £15m per annum.  It was agreed that the bank would not handle cash deposits. However, it deposited £365m, with around £264m in cash.”She said at its height, Fowler Oldfield deposited up to £1.8 million a day.NatWest chief executive Alison Rose, pictured above, said: “We deeply regret that NatWest failed to adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers between 2012 and 2016.“NatWest has a vital part to play in detecting and preventing financial crime and we take extremely seriously our responsibility to prevent money laundering by third parties.”The bank said that it was told the FCA will not take action against any current or former employee of NatWest over the matter.On the potential fine facing NatWest, Ms Montgomery said: “The appropriate harm figure is going to be around £170 million, with a multiplier of 200 per cent.”Paul Goldspring, the chief magistrate, said the figures involved were too large to be dealt with by the magistrate court, and sentencing will take place at Southwark Crown Court on or before December 8.More from Newspolitan Police worst force for solving sexual and violent crimeIn Liz Truss, Boris may have created a force more powerful than he realises‘I am not perfect’ says Insulate Britain protester after photos emerge of 10,000-mile holidayProtesters destroy pro-life stand at Oxford University freshers’ fairMedical student used fat suit to disguise himself as woman and attack ex-girlfriend with acidYou must know how to be impartial, BBC tells applicants for top news jobMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"never has campaign self defeating insulate britain","story":"If the police won’t, or can’t, because of loony woke protocols, the rest of us will do it instead. So, earlier this week a bunch of burly blokes removed Insulate Britain criminals from the middle of Wandsworth Bridge, and waved the cars through. Good on ‘em. I punched the air as I watched the clip.Has any protest group ever matched Insulate Britain for achieving something so counter-productive, in double-quick time? They appear to have united and radicalised the country against them far more efficiently than their cousins at Extinction Rebellion. Nobody had heard of them until about three weeks ago. Now the very name makes people want to rip out their loft insulation. In fact, polling shows that the more we know about the group, the less supportive we become. Nearly 50 per cent of people say they oppose their efforts, with just 27 per cent in support. Well done, chaps.And when we’re not spitting with rage, we’re rolling on the floor laughing. Insulate Britain is a source of endless comedy gold, with spokespeople swinging from the aggressive and the hopeless to the bizarrely unhinged. Take Liam Norton, who was forced to admit on live TV that he hasn’t even insulated his own home – at which point he walked off the set in a gigantic huff. One day he’ll stop digging.What’s even more risible is that much of the country already agrees that we should insulate more homes, and that we must get on with it. So, why’s Insulate Britain banging on? They might as well sit on the M25 demanding the abolition of workhouses, press gangs and child chimney sweeps.For heaven’s sake, the government’s Energy Company Obligation means that bigger energy companies are already obliged to offer free insulation or grants – sometimes worth up to 100 per cent of the cost – to help low-income households. And while the Green Homes Grant voucher scheme had its challenges, it led to many thousands of homes being upgraded, all on the tax-payer, with huge savings for owners.By the end of last year, more than 14 million properties had cavity wall insulation (that’s 70 per cent of relevant properties), and nearly 17 million had loft insulation (66 per cent of those with a loft). This is a big advance on a decade ago, and especially praiseworthy since 40 per cent of all homes in England and Wales were built before the war. It’s quite a big job to update them all, you know.Of course, Insulate Britain says it needs to happen more quickly. But by far the best, and certainly the most ethical, way to further that cause is by using law-abiding means of persuasion. Campaigners against smoking in pubs didn’t need to block motorways to achieve their objective, nor those in favour of no-fault orce, or those wanting to leave the EU. It’s just wrong to suggest that the only way for a campaign to make an impact is to engage in criminal, harmful activity. Perhaps Insulate Britain prefers virtue-signalling to meaningful change.“Aggressors should never succeed and law should prevail over the use of force”, said Margaret Thatcher. As usual, she was bang on, and her words are as apt today. If the government is serious about tackling these highway-blocking criminals it shouldn’t just ensure that the punishment fits the crime, preferably involving prison, but should call a halt to all government-funded home insulation until the motorway blockages cease. That’ll show the lawbreakers they’ll harm their own cause even more by continuing their campaign of misery.And the alternative? Why, any old group, with any old bee in its bonnet, will have every incentive to bring the country to a standstill. Come to think of it, I’ve long thought litter louts should receive instant £500 fines.

The bridge was dismantled in 1999 after visits by Winnie-the-Pooh enthusiasts caused too much wear and tear.The wooden planks lay behind a shed for years until two enterprising locals made an offer to the council, reconstructed the bridge – with missing pieces replaced by local oak – and put it up for auction.There were fears that Pooh’s global appeal would lead to the bridge being sold abroad. But Lord De La Warr lodged the winning bid, which was more than double the pre-sale estimate.Lord De La Warr owns the 2,000-acre Buckhurst Park estate, which includes an area that inspired Milne’s “100 Acre Wood”. However, he does not own the land on which Disney’s Poohsticks Bridge sits because it was sold off by his great-grandfather a century ago.Now, Lord De La Warr will be able to erect his bridge a short distance away from Disney’s replica. He can claim close links to the Winnie-the-Pooh story, as his father was a childhood friend of Christopher Milne and they played together in the woods.He said: “I am delighted to have been able to purchase the original bridge.“It will take pride of place on the estate, close to its original position, and I hope that many children (and adults) will be able to admire the original bridge which inspired one of the most famous games still played by children in the UK and abroad – Poohsticks.”Lord De La Warr told The  that more than a dozen bidders vied for the bridge. “I had set myself a limit and then I sort of had a feeling that probably it wasn’t quite enough, so I slightly upped it,” he said.“I didn’t like the idea of it going to America and if I hadn’t bought it, it would have gone abroad. I thought it should stay close to home.”Lord De La Warr plans to put the bridge over a stream in the 100 Acre Wood or close to The Dorset Arms pub in Withyham, which he also owns.James Rylands, a specialist in charge of the sale at Summers Place Auctions, said: “We were thrilled by the interest the bridge received globally, but are pleased that the bridge will stay in this country.”The seller, Mike Westphal, said the bridge had been “just dumped in a pile in the forest, under a sheet” when he bought it.He said: “Someone had to do something with it, and unfortunately that fell to me. It’s such an iconic item. It’s so many people’s childhoods.”More from Newspolitan Police worst force for solving sexual and violent crimeIn Liz Truss, Boris may have created a force more powerful than he realises‘I am not perfect’ says Insulate Britain protester after photos emerge of 10,000-mile holidayProtesters destroy pro-life stand at Oxford University freshers’ fairMedical student used fat suit to disguise himself as woman and attack ex-girlfriend with acidYou must know how to be impartial, BBC tells applicants for top news jobMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrew share strong family values says duchess york","story":"The Duchess of York has described her pride in the “strong family values” and unity she shares with Prince Andrew.The Duchess, 61, took to the stage at the Henley Literary Festival, where she was promoting her Mills \u0026amp Boon novel Her Heart for a Compass.While questions were carefully vetted in advance to avoid any awkward focus on the Royal family or her former husband’s sexual abuse lawsuit, she spoke warmly of her two new grandchildren, August and Sienna, both born this year, and the immense pride she has in her daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.Told that actress Emma Laird Craig would play her in the next series of The Crown, the Duchess exclaimed “poor lady!” and laughed as she queried whether the actress had red hair and wished her luck.Asked if she had any advice for the actress, she said: “Just do the best job she can. To be cast in The Crown  ... a very successful TV show, how fabulous!”The Duchess revealed she was already halfway through her second Mills \u0026amp Boon novel, with co-author Marguerite Kaye, which is called A Discerning Lady.She promised that it was “more of a sweeping romance” and that there would be “more bodice ripping” than in their first effort, which was published in August.On her daughters and their newborn babies, the Duchess said: “We all three of us keep our feet well on the ground. Both Prince Andrew and I feel very, very lucky.“We have strong family values and these two little naughties are phenomenal enhancers of an already unified family.Asked what kind of advice she gave Beatrice and Eugenie, she said: “When you go out of the front door, if you don\u0027t smile then don\u0027t go out of your front door.“Nobody wants to see a bad tempered princess. The pavement is a public place.”She added: “Humility is the finest thing you can ever have… to always remember where you have come from, who you are. Face your fears, be kind.I really strongly believe in no judgment, just getting on, and it too shall pass.In an apparent swipe at those online who have judged the Duke – with whom she still lives in Windsor – and his daughters, she criticised keyboard warriors”, adding: “Just stop it, get on, be joyous, be loving and be compassionate.”The Duchess, who has written many children’s books, including the successful Little Red and Budgie the Little Helicopter series, joked that hers would be the first books she read to her grandchildren.She revealed that August, Princess Eugenie’s son who was born in February, found her hysterically funny and laughed whenever she walked into the room.She also admitted that she could not wait for Sienna, born to Princess Beatrice last month, to read her novel, saying that she hoped she would know to stay strong and true to her beliefs.The Duchess also touched upon her own insecurities, admitting that 35 years in the public eye had occasionally left her wondering “how does the show go on?”She said: “I used to be so frightened of speaking openly about myself because of the fear about what other people would say.“This book is about really loving yourself, putting your oxygen mask on before helping another. I certainly did it myself.The Duchess admitted that she had no real idea how to write such a novel but that she and Kaye had learnt together.

There are also growing fears the US will maintain its ban on British holidaymakers until Thanksgiving at the end of November.Mr Shapps succeeded in killing off Department of Health proposals for fully jabbed travellers to video themselves taking lateral flow tests while supervised by a health adviser from a private firm.Holidaymakers will now only be required to send a picture of their test kit result, possibly with ID such as a passport.Travellers will have to book their tests before flying, as happens now with PCRs, and include the test kit number on the passenger locator forms which allow people into the UK.The Department of Health and Social Care will be responsible for getting the new testing system in place by the start of the half term on Oct 23.  Sources said it would be ready by the time families started to return at the end of October at the latest.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said: “Our robust border measures have helped protect the phenomenal progress of our vaccination programme, and it is because of this success both here and around the world that we can safely open up travel further and we can visit friends and family abroad.“We’re now making it easier and cheaper for people to travel by allowing fully vaccinated travellers from non-red list countries to use lateral flow tests on day two of arrival, as long as they provide proof of use.”The Government also announced it would recognise vaccines for arrivals from a further 37 countries and territories including Brazil, Ghana, Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Turkey.The decision means fully vaccinated people entering England from these locations will be exempt from quarantine, the pre-departure test and the day-eight post-arrival test.Only unvaccinated travellers now have to take a pre-departure test and then quarantine for 10 days on their return and pay for PCR tests on days two and eight of their return. The pre-departure test for double jabbed travellers was ditched on Oct 4.The latest moves follow the Foreign Office lifting its “ban” on non-essential travel to 32 countries including Fiji, Malaysia and Bangladesh.

And that creates the sense that anyone who disagrees is being unbelievably unreasonable and needs to be silenced, he said. I find it quite sinister. We have to regain the ability to be disagreed with.He was speaking on the It\u0027s All Relative podcast which is hosted by Dr Eliza Filby, a historian who interviews two generations of a family. He appeared alongside his niece, the writer Jessica Fellowes.I find this tremendously prescriptive society we\u0027re living through at the moment rather naive, Julian Fellowes added. Every generation believes different things. Some of the things some generations believe seem wrong to us. Some of them are just bewildering.But the idea that we should judge them because they didn\u0027t believe the same things we believe… I think is naive.On issues such as climate change and ersity, Fellowes said: What I feel very strongly about this generation is that they allow all their views to be dictated. And I wish they would come up with some original views.He also said it was wrong to cancel people for things they had said many years ago. Most recently, England cricketer Ollie Robinson, 27, was suspended from international cricket over a series of racist and sexist tweets he had posted when aged 18 and 19.In 2015, Fellowes referred to the young as this great excuse generation, where nothing\u0027s ever your own fault and everything\u0027s always because someone was terrible to you.But he told the podcast that he now felt sympathy towards students because they had suffered due to the pandemic, saying: I think what they’ve gone through in the last 18 months has been extremely difficult, particularly the school and university generation who have essentially missed out on the experience.And I don\u0027t know what compensatory measures can be taken now, but I doubt very much they will be fully compensated for what they\u0027ve missed.More from Newspolitan Police worst force for solving sexual and violent crimeIn Liz Truss, Boris may have created a force more powerful than he realises‘I am not perfect’ says Insulate Britain protester after photos emerge of 10,000-mile holidayProtesters destroy pro-life stand at Oxford University freshers’ fairMedical student used fat suit to disguise himself as woman and attack ex-girlfriend with acidYou must know how to be impartial, BBC tells applicants for top news jobMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"whisper children like living parents","story":"The Spanish government wants to pay young adults to stop living with their parents. The average Spaniard doesn’t leave the family home until the age of 30. So Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is proposing a new £250 monthly voucher for 18-35-year-olds, to encourage them to rent their own homes.Although British children leave home earlier than most Europeans (24, on average) we, too, are slowing down. Around 3.5 million young adults in the UK now live with their parents, an increase of a third in a decade. This is generally thought to be a bad thing, caused by exorbitant housing costs.But what if there’s more to it than just economics? What if children are staying at home because – whisper it – they actually like living with their parents?It’s not impossible, the way it once was. Previous generations of parent were almost ideologically opposed to getting chummy with their children. The sons of the ruling classes were systematically removed from the home at seven, lest they should grow too attached to their mothers. Separation was thought to be character-building. Even in the most loving families, the ide between young and old was clearly demarcated by authority – the absolute rule of the parents.Since the Sixties, each generation of parents has further loosened its collar. Rules of intergenerational decorum that once seemed cast iron have been bent, and then broken, and then tossed aside. My own parents, though exceedingly relaxed and bonhomous for their time, drew the line at letting boys stay over. When I was 21, a boyfriend hitchhiked all the way from Newcastle to London to see me. “How wonderful!” said my dad, ushering him in. “We’d better put a tent up in the garden.”My cohort of parents has largely jettisoned that rule. Indeed, the traditional cry of “My house, my rules” seems to be fading out altogether. Children are increasingly treated as equals – albeit truculent and ignorant equals – whose voices should be heard.The results of this experiment are mixed: no one could claim that the nation’s children appear much happier or more well-behaved for it. But they do seem to enjoy the company of their parents – and vice versa. Several surveys have found that, despite the stresses of lockdown, most families have relished spending more time together since the pandemic began.Far from being a sign of failure, living with your parents denotes a kind of success. After centuries of struggle, families may finally be learning to get along.Uniquely among the human race, I have never watched The Sopranos. I’m sure it’s as good as everyone says, but I find our cultural fascination with the mafia irksome. I can’t buy into the idea of violent thugs being brilliant strategists, or full of hidden depths.Sure enough, the reality is gratifyingly stupid. Court papers filed in New York reveal that members of the Colombo crime family have been conducting extortion rackets by text message, leaving a juicy digital trail for detectives. According to one former mobster, it’s a generational problem: “Everything is on the phones with them!” But one of the texts – “Hey, this is the 2nd text, there isn’t going to be a 3rd” – was sent by a 56-year-old knuckle-dragger.

Toxic type of scroll model Oh, how I chuckled when social media addicts bewailed the six-hour shutdown of Facebook. They came on the airwaves to express grief at being cut off from their communications drug. There is one sure way of getting this monkey off their back. Just say No. Facebook has been with us for only  years, its subsidiary profit-making s Instagram and WhatsApp for even fewer.  Before that, we got by with email, the phone, the letter and that most rewarding form of communication of all, conversation. Between real people, face to face. Why should we now put ourselves in thrall to the multi-billionaire Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg  And put young people at risk of addiction to this toxic drug  I have nothing to do with social media – any of it – and I don’t feel my le is inadequate.

My heart quite honestly bled for him when I heard of the struggles of him and his colleagues, on the same day that they implemented a £ cut to Universal Credit, affecting hundreds of thousands of families across the UK.  It continued: I’m sure with the struggles these MPs are experiencing themselves, they must rely heavily on The Trussell Trust and the other charities that offer similar services to those facing hardship.We should take it as an absolute blessing that these food banks exist under the Government of a well-developed country, who due to their careful and diligent spending throughout Covid and Brexit have made these services more necessary and critical than ever.So far the page has raised a rather modest £.

During the wide-ranging interview, the -year-old father-of-one also opened up about his turbulent childhood, which almost included him and his siblings being taken into care after mum Mary was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The MP said he has faced mental health struggle which only became clear to him when a local councillor urged him to seek support. He said: It was an important moment, actually, because I thought, this is visible to other people. Iaposm clearly not happy. My Coyle said he appeared to be completely ing and was out and about in parliament, but the atmosphere in Westminster was febrile as the aftermath of the Brexit vote played out.  Things came to a head when his home, which he shares with his we and young daughter Esme, was targeted. He said: I had somebody break the window, my home, my bedroom window home during the Brexit debate. He added: There’s no way out the back, it’s a brick wall. So, I was sat with a cricket bat in case they came through. The MP said he needed help from therapists in the weeks and months ahead as the massive stress took a toll. He said: Iaposve had bouts of depression and things, but I have CBT . I think that when Jo was murdered, it triggered lots... that was a very dficult time. Mr Coyle, who grew up in Luton alongside two brothers and a sister, said his childhood was very dficult but, in the end, helped him to build emotional resilience.  He said his motheraposs mental health deteriorated when his father left. He said: Sadly, some of my earliest memories are the most dficult. There was a time where mum set fire to the living room carpet because she was trying to keep us warm. There was no intent to damage or harm anybody or the property. We used to have the coin meter. People donapost see them anymore, so they find it hard to understand - but I donapost know whether she didnapost have any money to work the heating system. I donapost know whether her mental health had collapsed so badly that she just didnapost know how to do it - but she set fire to the carpet. Mary was previously a primary school teacher and ran a drop-in club for kids, but her mental state crumbled very badly and she was eventually sectioned. Mr Coyle revealed how this occurred again recently, but she only got help after she crashed her car into a bollard. While no-one was hurt, a psychiatric assessment was ordered, he said. Mr Coyle said: It was only because she was in the criminal justice system that the magistrate was able to order a psychiatric assessment, and thataposs what got her back into mental healthcare, which is crazy. The system is crazy, not people. The MP added that he was grateful that as a youngster he wasnapost taken into local authority care He said: My nan was integral to keeping us togetheroutcomes for children in care in those days were dramatically worse than they are now, and theyaposre still very poor for many children.Comment MORE ON Labour PartyAsdaMental healthSocial servicesCrimeDangerous drivingCar crashesPoliticsBenefitsTax Credits\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely, he told Sky News.The mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools and colleges was scrapped in May, but Government guidance says that directors of public health could advise schools to reintroduce themcases spike.It comes after Government figures showed the number of children out of school for Covid- related reasons in England increased by two thirds in a fortnight. The DfE estimates that .% of all pupils - more than , children - were not in class for reasons connected to coronavirus on Thursday last week.This is up from , children, or .% of all pupils, on September  - a % rise from two weeks ago.Mr Zahawi also defended the slow rollout of carbon dioxide monitors which were first promised by the Department for Education in August.In Wales, secondary school and college pupils will be advised to take daily lateral flow tests for seven dayssomeone in their household tests positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has announced. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid- measures had on attendance. He said: The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - % of schools are open. Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about %, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open. But he said he was not looking toto the bubble system to do so, because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children. That is despite Englnad’s schools previously being told backup plans must “cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce ‘bubbles’ for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. “Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of ‘bubbles’ would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education.” Comment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That is despite think tanks putting the worst-case estimate at around , to , people. The Joseph Rowntree Foundationhas said the cut risks moving , people including , children below the poverty line. While the Legatum Institute think tank, led by Tory UC architect Baroness Stroud, says the change will hit , Brits who are currently just above the poverty line - including , children. But ministers have no official figure for how many people will be thrown into poverty because they’ve refused to do a formal impact assessment. And questioned by left-wing journalist Owen Jones at the Tory conference, Ms Dorries said: “Nobody. Nobody is.  “No no no, because, no Owen of course not. “Because what we’re doing, what we’re doing is giving people a step out. “By letime skills guarantee, by all the money being invested in the…” - she then walked away with an aide. Analysis by the JRF has found more than , working-age families in Ms Dorries’ Mid Bedfordshire constituency will be affected by the cut to UC and Tax Credits. That includes % of all working-age families with childrenand % of all working-age families without children . Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “These comments show just how far away the Conservative Party is from the real world. “Charities and foodbanks have been warning for months that taking £, away from millions of families in the midst of a Conservative cost of living crisis will push children into poverty.” The cut officially began yesterday and will kick into payments from next Wednesday. Read more Boris Johnson did not mention it once in his -minute conference speech which was peppered with jokes.Katie Schmuecker of the JRF said yesterday: “The Prime Minister has not had the guts to look the millions of people whose incomes are being cut today in the eye and tell them how they are expected to get through the year ahead. “The Prime Minister’s attempt to strike an upbeat tone is completely at odds with the despair people are feeling and the cost-of-living crisis we are now facing.” Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey was asked the same question as Ms Dorries by Owen Jones. She replied: “Well it was always a temporary uplt, and that’s why no impact assessment was done when we knew it was temporary. “We are investing in the plan for jobs, we’ve also got the household support fund… we want to try and see what’s going on, what it is we can to help people with the skills so they can absolutely take advantage of higher-paid jobs.” Comment MORE ON Nadine DorriesOwen JonesJonathan ReynoldsBoris JohnsonConservative PartyPensionspovertyPoliticsBenefitsTax Credits\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She said she had gained a bit of weight but thought it was just normal weight fluctuation. It wasnapost until the night she gave birth in a summer cottage sheaposd visited with her family that she realised something was wrong. She said: “I had just woken up and my mother and sister and my daughter were outside already. “At the last minute, I was able to shout ‘Mum’ because I heard her coming into the house to get something.  “She came into my room and saw me in pain and about to push for the first time. She asked: ‘ARE YOU PREGNANT! ’ and I answered: ‘I guess so.’ By the time her mum had run into the room, the babyaposs head was already crowning. Tilda recalls her mum askingshe could wait to push, but there was no way she could delay any longer. My mum went to get some towels and get some more help from my uncle, who called the ambulance. While he was on the call, I pushed three times and the baby was out, she said. When the ambulance arrived, baby Alec had already been born. He and Tilda were taken to hospital to be checked over as Tilda hadnapost had any scans or tests throughout the pregnancy.  “I was confused, scared, anxious. I was alone already, a single mother for my daughter and now another one was coming into our lives, she said. “Luckily, the baby was perfectly fine and healthy.” While in hospital, Tilda started to organise what she could and her family helped prepare for them coming home. She needed to find a new car seat for the baby, as well as a double pram to take both kids out and about. “It was pretty dficult to buy everything in such a hurry but I managed it pretty well in my opinion and I’m lucky to have my parents and other relatives help with buying everything, she said. Four days later, Tilda was allowed to take Alec home from hospital. Heaposs now three months old and thriving. Tilda says after she got over the initial shock, she has embraced being a mum to two little ones. She said: “I came to terms with what had happened. It took a few weeks but I’m fine with it now.

According to figures released by the ZOE COVID Study App, the total number of cases this week is up . per cent from , last week. Experts have warned of the risks of allowing for the virus to run rampant among groups of young people aged between  and , where cases are surging the most. A total of one in  are currently infected with Covid in this age group. Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist on the ZOE COVID Study app, commented on the latest data saying we can only hope that some kind of herd immunity will kick in and cases will drop. What are your thoughts on this  Let us know in the comments below In the double vaccinated population, it is estimated there are currently , new daily symptomatic cases in the UK, a drop on the , cases last week. That while England has the highest R rate in the UK at ., followed by Wales at . and Scotland at .. On average  in  people in the UK currently have symptomatic Covid. “While Covid may be less severe in children, allowing Covid to run rampant among them is a real gamble, Professor Spector said. With more than  in  older school-children now infected and as we predicted numbers rising, many will not escape long-term symptoms. These are the highest rates since January .  Without vaccination or restrictions in this group, we can only hope that some kind of herd immunity will kick in and cases will drop. The good news this week is our latest research shows having a natural Covid infection before double vaccination means greater protection. This is really positive news for overall immunity levels in the UK and means that large numbers of people will have effective and long lasting protection from Covid. The evidence supports the need for vaccination, even for those who have already had Covid. We need to be less complacent and without restrictions much more focus needs to be put on getting everyone vaccinated before winter to keep up with other countriesapos efforts.” It comes as the total amount of infections since Covid broke out in March last year passed million in the UK, with almost , news cases recorded on Wednesday.

Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was found unresponsive at a home in Shirley, Solihull on June  last year. He died at Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital the following day - with a post-mortem examination confirming his death was caused by a head injury.Arthuraposs father Thomas Hughes,  and Emma Tustin, aged , were subsequently arrested and charged, reports Birmingham Live.Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC told Coventry Crown Court: Arthur was denied the opportunity to eat meals with other members of the family. If he didnapost comply with instructions he was denied access to water.  You heard messages of Arthur calling for his uncle or nanny. Arthur wasnapost permitted to maintain relationships with his uncles and grandparents. He was isolated from them. Evidence indicates Arthur was physically and verbally abused, isolated, access to food and drink controlled or restricted. He was deprived of basic living comforts. Emma Tustin recorded more than  audio files of Arthur in ious stages of distress. Mr Hankin also told the court Arthur was made to stand on the step by the front door for up to  hours a day. He continued: It is inconceivable a reasonable carer would be unaware the prolonged isolation, forcible standing, control of access to food and drink were the cause of Arthuraposs distressed state. In my opinion these clips show Arthur articulating his needs extremely clearly. He is desperately calling for help. It appears to be very clear, in calling for his uncle and his grandparents he is expressing he wants adults to come who will care for him and will put an end to his suffering. In conjunction with the CCTV footage, in my judgement over a period spanning many weeks Ms Tustin and Mr Hughes terrorised Arthur, degraded, neglected and physically and emotionally abused him.Mr Hankin also told the court it is suspected the six-year-old was repeatedly poisoned with salt contaminated food or fluids possibly by thirsting him.He told the court that between .am and .pm on June  Arthur consumed around grams of salt, equal to six and a half tablespoons.One medical expert concluded Arthur could have been aposrepeatedly administered moderate doses of saltapos.The court heard how Arthur was fatally injured in Tustinaposs sole care while Hughes was out shopping, jurors hear Mr Hankin says Tustin, Hughes and Arthur ed to Cranmore Road at pm but at around .pm Hughes left to go to the supermarket. He continued: It was during that absence Arthur was assaulted, suffering unsurvivable brain injuries. Evidence shows the event that caused Arthuraposs collapse occurred while he was in Emma Tustinaposs sole care.  Mr Hankin says Tustin messaged Hughes at .pm to complain that Arthur was aposstill screamingapos. He told the court at .pm Hughes texted Tustin explaining he had spotted his mother in Sainsburyaposs and asked Tustin to aposmove him to the back doorapos in case his mother visited. The prosecutor said Tustin was upstairs between .pm and .pm and sent a picture message to Hughes showing Arthuraposs face. Mr Hankin added: There was a blue mark on his forehead consistent with a bruise. There appears to be blood on the right nostril. His lips were red. His right eye was closed. From his expression he appears to be in pain. The jury heard Tustin claimed to Hughes that Arthur had aposthrew himself against the wall in the bedroomapos. Mr Hankin says the first ambulance arrived at .pm with the crew witnessing Arthur on his back on the floor receiving CPR from the neighbour. He states he aposrapidly progressed to cardiac arrestapos but advanced le support measures were able to restore his heartbeat.Mr Hankin told the court Arthuraposs gums were bleeding and his teeth were in poor condition. He says he was transferred to Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital where he arrived at .pm.The prosecutor told the court around pm Tustin, who had remained at home, appeared to knock over the camera inside the property seconds before a police officer entered the room. Returning to Arthur, Mr Hankin says he aposremained very unstableapos and suffered two further cardiac arrests. He was transferred to intensive care and had a CT scan which showed aposindicators of physical abuseapos. They have both pleaded not guilty to murder. Tustin has admitted one count of assaulting a child but has denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes also denies child assault offences.

Natalia Georgis, from Hayes, London, weighed st lb when she put on a bridesmaid dress in May , the largest size the shop had, which had also been altered to fit her. Seeing the pictures had a “huge effect” on her confidence, she said, and how she had felt in the dress prevented her from enjoying the experience as much as she would have liked to. It was from that moment that I knew I wanted to make a change and start to lose some of the weight,” Natalia said. She began researching options to start her weight loss journey and decided to fork out £, - with the help of her family - to undergo a gastric sleeve fitting later that year in a bid to shrink her frame. Two weeks prior to the fitting, I had to only drink milk and was allowed one stock cube a day to keep my levels up,” she said. And after the fitting, she was only able to eat soups and soft foods. Natalia, who now weighs st lbs and is a size , was also told that the gastric sleeve would only help her lose part of her weight - the majority of her results would come from her own hard work.  For two months I was not able to do any form of exercise after the fitting which was incredibly frustrating,” she recalled. “Once the two month mark had cleared, I was in the gym four times a week working hard on my cardio, and when the lockdown came about, I would do home workouts. Even when I was not feeling up to going, I would push myself because I would be reminded of what I was working for. Natalia was also motivated by the positive comments of friends and family around her on her journey. She said: There was nothing more encouraging than somebody saying that I looked really good lately and askingI had lost weight. The confidence boost it gave me, combined with the results of my hard work at the gym showing on the scales was incredible. Natalia also changed her diet entirely in order to work with her new active lestyle. She said one of the best things about her journey was discovering how much she enjoyed cooking. Whereas before I would jump for an early option like a takeaway Chinese or a curry, I am now buying all of my ingredients fresh and cooking at home. I still eat three meals a day, but I am now far more conscious of healthier options and alternatives to what I was eating before. It has also had an incredibly positive affect on her mental health, as her concern about being judged for weight was gone. Now, I can hold a conversation with anyone and go out feeling like my confidence has never been higher,” she said. As a result of her incredible weight loss, Natalia was left with loose skin, which she has been treated for at Highgate Private Hospital in London. She added: I have to have three rounds of surgery costing a total of £, in order to remove the excess skin and have currently had two so far.” The initial surgery was “quite traumatic”, she said, especially as she had to go back into surgery after her first procedure in order to correct an internal bleed. The second surgery was in September and was totally dferent, and I was up and walking around almost immediately afterwards which was brilliant.” Her third and final surgery is approaching in December. Natalia had managed to stay grounded despite receiving a lot of interest from men since her body transformation. I have had a lot of messages but in all honesty, I am in a great place right now and am happy,” she laughed. Natalia began sharing her journey online on TikTok, where she has an amazing .k followers, videos with over k likes, and receives messages from lots of people asking for advice. Before long, I was getting people reaching out and asking for tips and calling me an inspiration which was a real shock,” she said. I was just trying to be as honest as possible and send recipes and tips which worked for me to anyone who asked for my advice. Nataliaaposs diet before her lestyle change:Breakfast: Full English Breakfast Lunch: Easy Drive Thru food like McDonalds and KFC Dinner: Chinese   Indian takeawayNataliaaposs diet after her lestyle change:Breakfast: Mushrooms, tomatoes and bacon medallions Lunch: Salad with homemade seasoned chicken or salmon with broccoli and sweetcorn.

Jean Williams says her le is being aposdestroyedapos and the livelihoods of many of her friends apossacricedapos thanks to new employment rules. Her  year career working on the river boats of Europe has been in serious jeopardy since the UK officially left the EU at the beginning of . Now the -year-old, her husband, son and thousands like them must apply for inidual visas for each EU country they visit or sail through the waters of, as well as buy private health insurance. She calculates the total extra cost at almost £, a year, with the y visa application process taking up to eight weeks. As a result of the extra bureaucracy, many cruise firms are refusing to hire British workers, Jean says.For cruise workers are least, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs promises that Brexit would be a aposbonfire of red tapeapos and would lead to aposhundreds of thousands of new jobsapos seem a far cry from reality.My husband and I did not want Brexit. We voted to remain but we are most definitely victims of Brexit, Jean, from Kent, told The Mirror. I do not remember Mr Johnson saying that the entertainment industry’s professions, livelihoods and lives would be sacriced when he was campaigning for Brexit over five years ago.  While I may not agree with the decision to leave the EU, I respect the outcome of Brexit. But I don’t deserve to be Brexit’s victim either. I am not a remoaner as we have been unfairly labelled, but because these issues were not sorted out properly before we left the EU, Brexit is destroying my le, the lives of my family, the lives of many people I know personally and thousands of people I will never know. For the first  years of Jean and husband Glenaposs careers as entertainers on cruise ships their work le was relatively simple.  As passport holders of an EU country they had the right to move and work in  other European nations with no need for a visa or health insurance. All of that changed when the UK officially left the bloc. If we visit ten countries, we have to get ten visas, Jean said. You have to apply for them at the embassies in London. You go for an appointment and you have an interview. It is a lot of paper work and thereaposs no guarantee youaposll get a visa. The visas cost about £ each. We are also talking health insurance which you never needed before. Thataposs £, a year for my husband and I. When the industry started to restart after the coronavirus pandemic, Jean discovered the new rules were having a big impact on her employment opportunities.She continued: I started to notice that the adverts advertising the positions us Brits have been doing for decades, were now saying aposEU passport holders onlyapos. Agencies told me they wonapost employ us when I called them. To put this into perspective, we are actually talking about hundreds of thousands of UK jobs and lives being effected here. UK workers including the self employed, cruise directors, entertainers, musicians, dancers, speciality acts, bar staff, chefs, waiters, cleaners, sound crew, lighting crew, hairdressers, makeup artistsare all going to lose work to European Workers unless an agreement is made between the UK and the EU to enable us all to continue to work in Europe. Many of these people effected are young people who are just starting out. Many have studied long and hard and got themselves into financial debt in order to be able to do the job of their dreams, only to find there are no jobs for them. Many of these peopleare very experienced in their chosen profession and have been working in the same industry for many years and this is how we are repaid for all our hard work over the years. Jean and Glen are determined to jump through the bureaucratic hoops and fork out the extra costs so they can continue working in the industry they love. Others, including two of the six couples they most recently worked on stage with, have already given up on cruise ship work or are in the process of doing so. My son and his girlfriend have been working for many years as a dance couple for a UK agent throughout Europe, only to be told this year their contract is cancelled as the agency can no longer work them anymore due to the EU restrictions and they are both devastated, Jean added. When asked whether the UK had plans to negotiate an EU wide work visa for British workers, a Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Officer simply said: Visa routes for other countries are a matter for those countries.

Kate Marlow, from Bridgend, Wales, said her home has flooded four times in less than two years, causing more than £, worth of damage. The -year-old said the problems started when Storm Dennis struck in February last year, WalesOnline reports. Water poured into the home, which she shares with her mum, brother and five dogs, ruining everything apart from the top floor.She said: We moved into our house in August  and all was fine until Storm Dennis arrived in early . All this water came running down the mountain road opposite and went right through the garage and into our home - the bottom two floors of which are technically below ground level because the house is built on a gradient.  She added that everything other than the top floor was ruined - furniture destroyed, ceilings put through - and the family were forced to move into temporary accommodation while the clean-up and repair work took place.Unfortunately, because of our dogs, the closest pet-friendly place we could find was in Barry - nearly  miles away - and the arrival of Covid restrictions meant we ended up stuck there for  months, she added. However, an initial council review deemed the incident a one-off, attributable to the freak conditions brought about by the storm.  But,  days later, the same thing happened again - and then for a third time in January . On that occasion Iaposd driven back from Barry to let the painters and decorators in, only to find inside was soaking wet, said Kate.And now itaposs happened for a fourth time following that awful weather we had earlier this week.That said, none of our neighbours ever seem to be affected - they canapost work out why it keeps happening and neither can we.  Bank worker Kate said her home is the only property on the road that is repeatedly hit by flood water whenever thereaposs heavy rainfall. Thereaposs just farm land above us, along with an old quarry from which any excess water would drain away in dferent directions, she said. Maybe somethingaposs changed to alter the route of that run-off, I just donapost know. Weaposve had a look around and none of the nearby culverts seem to be blocked or anything.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter What I am sure of though is that itaposs like living at the bottom of a water slide and whenever it starts raining heavily any hope of being able to sleep at night goes out the window. Itaposs so stressful. Weaposve reached out to the council for help but, after being told theyaposd look into it, weaposve heard nothing. Our last contact with them was back in February. And while our insurance company has been very good so far, thereaposs a limit to how often theyaposll be willing to pay out. I just canapost bear the idea of losing everything yet again. A spokesperson from Bridgend County Borough Council said, We have maintained contact with the residents at this address and visited the property as recently as this week. A great deal of work has been carried out to try and determine the source of the flooding. While it appears to occur during exceptionally heavy rainfall, the cause is not linked to the council-maintained drainage network.  He added that following investigations and discussions with local private landowners a scheme has been developed which would enable inlet headwalls - small retaining structures placed at the entrance of storm water pipes or culverts - to be improved on a nearby private road. During severe weather, this would seek to mitigate excess water from running down the road and affecting the property in the event that the sheer volume proves to be too much for the inlets to cope with, the spokesman said.However, this work requires both landowner approval and funding from Welsh Government before it can be implemented. While it is progressing, we are looking at other options for capturing surface water run-off in the area, and have contacted local landowners to discuss issues such as clearing debris from existing inlet grids, their rights and responsibilities around water courses and more.

Soon after they moved in, the toilet and the shower began leaking downstairs into the kitchen - resulting in mould appearing in the kitchen cupboards. Have you had a new build nightmare  Email webnews@mirror The family then found nails sticking out of the gate leading into the back garden - a danger to their -year-old son. This all came after long delays after completing the purchase with Bovis Homes back in . Aneta said: “Everything is mouldy, I open the cupboards and it smells of mould and damp. I’ve been told to bleach it and will help it.  “I was sleeping in the house with my son and we were quite scared because the backdoor wouldnapost lock. “They sent people to fix things and started doing things and then not. “They say they’re really trying and doing everything they can but they’re doing nothing.  “I had a lot of workmen at home, take photos and then leave. Just took photos of the issue and didn’t solve anything. “I sent regular updates about my floor etc and no response. Every single item is incorrect or damaged. “Seriously I don’t know what to do. My new house is getting mouldier and mouldier. My home is like a building site.” Aneta’s son has autism so “he needs to know what is going to happen” but they’ve had unexpected visits which have been “very unsettling” for him.  She says she is now struggling to get in contact with Bovis Homes to continue to resolve the issues in their house. A Bovis Homes spokesperson said: “We are in regular communication with the customer and are continuing to work with her to arrange safe access to recty these items. “We have been attending the property to resolve issues since the inspection, however, further works are required. “Our Area Customer Manager attended the property this week with a plumber, and we have a clear plan of action to ensure all issues are resolved.

Teessideaposs iconic Grand Hotel is currently being partially used as temporary accommodation for desperate families fleeing the Taliban. However it has been swamped with TripAdvisor complaints from guests bemoaning uncontrollable refugee children, while a flurry of one-star reviews have seen it currently ranked as the worst hotel in the seaside town.It comes after the venue found itself at the centre of a bomb hoax this week in which guests were evacuated while police stormed the area, Teesside Live.Anti-refugee leaflets were also posted around the town, dubbed reprehensible by local councillor David Chance, who claimed they were methods designed to undermine efforts to help the families. Two women who planned on visiting the hotel later this month said they have now been told they will not be able to claim a refund from National Holidays for the £ they paid each.  One of the women, who both asked not to be named, said: Our concern is about safety and leaving things in our room, because of what we read about theft and kids running wild. By no means are we racist - Iaposve worked with refugees, and it is not their fault. It is just the predicament that they are in. I totally agree they should have got out the country, but my concern is the company didnapost inform us what the Grand Hotel was doing. They claim when they contacted the firm, they were effectively told they wouldnapost get a penny of their £ back, with the booking having no cancellation policy. They further claimed they were told they could present evidence that the hotel was being used to house refugees, but that any complaint may not be dealt with until after their break.  They are basically saying thatwe get to the hotel and donapost feel safe, then that is our problem - but it it is their problem, as they should have notied us, said the woman, who claims she only found out about the other guests on social media. As a customer they should be informing all of the paying guests what is going on there. The hotel found itself at the centre of a bomb hoax this week in which guests were evacuated while police stormed the area. Mondayaposs hoax, as well as anti-refugee leaflets being posted around the town, were later reportedly dubbed reprehensible by local councillor David Chance, who claimed they were methods designed to undermine efforts to help the families.And defending the hotelaposs temporary tenants, he told Examiner Live: If you go on holiday you will always have a bit of boisterousness. Thereaposs no doubt about that. Our kids abroad can be just as bad. I have experienced it myself.My point of view is that we should be helping them as much as we can and I find it reprehensible that people are trying to undermine them. The same people trying to have a problem will no doubt not have done much for our armed forces. Around  refugees are reportedly staying at Scarborough hotels, including the -year-old Victorian venue, which is owned by Britannia Hotels.They are among the thousands flown to Britain earlier this year following the Talibanaposs resurgence, in what was one of the biggest ever evacuation operations.

Margaret McDonald has been waiting since  to have the op done and claims she was the same weight - around -and-a-half stone - when she had surgery seven years ago on her other knee. The -year-old, from Anniesland, Glasgow, has osteoarthritis and said the pain is so severe in her knee she was prescribed morphine doses similar to someone dying from cancer. Sheaposs been presented for surgery by her GP multiple times in five years but each time a pre-op assessment at the Scottish cityaposs Queen Elizabeth Hospital has led to her being told she is too heavy. And despite attending reduced mobility exercise classes designed for OAPs seeing her lose over a stone, Margaret was still told her body mass index needs to come down.Have you had a similar issue to Margaret  Let us know at webnews@mirror A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde told the Mirror a BMI limit of  and under is a clinical requirement for this type of procedure. With Margaretaposs height of ftin, her BMI is around , meaning she just misses the cut off. NHS guidance also states while morbidly obese patients should not normally be listed for such an op, there can be exceptions when all reasonable attempts have been made to reduce weight and there are compelling circumstances. After doing her own research, Margaret said patients in similar circumstances have found some private orthopaedic surgeons will operate beyond the  threshold. She said each exercise class has left her bedridden for a day after due to knee inflammation, while a side-effect of the chronic depression medication she takes is weight gain. Margaretaposs psychiatrist has even been slowly reducing her dosage in an effort to help her sht the pounds - but she said losing a substantial amount in her condition is not possible. The grandmother-of-three said her le is like a permanent lockdown, and she even had to have her beloved dog Bruno re-homed because she couldnapost take him on walks.  I’ve lost my voluntary work that I used to do. I’ve lost doing things with my family, taking part in my grandkids’ activities. The impact it’s had on me has been incredible, she said. I’ve been presented for surgery three or four times but every time I was told no, BMI is too high. When you’re immobile and nothing much you can do regarding exercise what are you meant to do  I don’t just sit and eat my face off all day and not care about my weight. I just can’t sustain [any physical activities] because of pain and immobility. The impact on everyday le is just horrendous. Getting dressed, doing day-to-day things that you take for granted. Anytime I need anything I have to go online because I can’t even walk around the supermarket or go to a park, there’s nothing I can do. It’s like being in lockdown for five years. You’re just existing, that’s about it - it’s a horrible existence, she added. Margaretaposs daughter is her certied carer but has three young sons to look after as well and lives where. Prior to her mobility issues she said she was far more active and even taught first aid as a volunteer. She previously worked for the City of Glasgow College for  years and has been volunteering for the Scottish Police Authority, which she has been able to continue from home in the pandemic. An NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokesman said: While we cannot comment on inidual patients, a BMI limit of  and under is a clinical requirement for us to proceed with procedures of this nature. We have every sympathy with patients who may struggle with their weight and provide advice and support to help reduce weight before surgery. Once BMI has been reduced, patients are reassessed with a view to progressing treatment. We are in touch with Ms McDonald and will work with her to achieve a positive outcome.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSHospitalsMental healthArthritisFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Hilarious footage shows the moment Patrick solved the conundrum, catching their ginger pussycat Tivali tiptoeing across their window ledge with a massive bag of Dreamies hanging from his mouth, despite his meagre size.

The cheeky cataposs unusual thieving habit has made him a local celebrity and the couple admit the strangest thing he has stolen and brought home was a dauphinoise potato. Lauren, from the Cotswolds, said: We had started noticing treats outside. There would be empty treat bags by the door - Dreamies, Aldi treat packets even dog treats. You name it we’d had it. In total Tiv must have stolen at least  bags,not more. We were really unsure where he was getting them from so it was a mystery. We were so shocked when Patrick saw Tiv running at the window with the full bag. We werenapost exactly sure how he was bringing them back but from the video you can see he carries the full bag.

To celebrate the launch of Zinger Popcorn Bucket - available for a limited time only - we decided to champion people who like to spice things up, including Hannah Murphy, . When she reached a career crossroads in , Hannah struck out on a new adventurous course, and almost a decade on has no regrets about her bold decision. When I was made redundant from my eight-year career as a flight attendant, flying both domestically and between the UK and Japan, I saw it as an opportunity set myself a new challenge, and have new adventures, says Hannah who lives in Southampton with her husband and three children, Angelina, , Archie,  and Adriana, five. At the time I was a single mum of one after my previous relationship ended, and the ‘sensible’ decision would have been to take a - desk job, something stable but didnapost challenge me. That’s just not me though, I have to love what I do and find joy in it every day. Instead, Hannah trained as a fitness instructor and began to incorporate a hula hoop into her training. It wasn’t just a useful exercise tool, great for toning and core strength, it was so much fun. The moment I started hula hooping, I was transported back to my childhood, it was really liberating. As word got out about Hannah’s hula hooping prowess, friends and family began to ask for lessons, followed by requests from local schools for Hannah to come in and teach children how to hula hoop.  It snowballed and before I knew it, I had so much interest in hula hooping fitness classes, I had to train other instructors to help me. I went on to create a training programme called Globe Fit and today I have teachers all around the world, from Australia to America, all teaching my programme. I love teaching hula hooping, particularly adults, because they might start off a bit self-conscious and inhibited but soon their inner child is released and they just go for it! I’ve taught people aged from teenagers to eighty-year-olds. Last year, I hosted the first ever world hula hooping championship, which will be taking place again later this year. After launching the UKaposs first hula hooping championship in , which took place in Fareham, Hampshire, Hannah decided to go global in . Not even a pandemic could stop her with the event going virtual and around twenty-five competitors, women and men of all ages and abilities, taking part from as far afield as India, America and Australia. I had a  of four judges, including John Parnell aka Hoop Guy who appeared on Britainaposs Got Talent in . Competitors submitted videos of themselves performing with their hoop, and were marked on everything from skill to tricks they could do, with the  judging the videos.  The second world championship will take place in December this year, again virtually, and I hope to have even more people taking part. It’s amazing to be a part of people experiencing something new and fun, it doesn’t feel like work! Hannah’s story is a great example of how le can get better when you try something new, soyou already love Popcorn chicken - tasty pops of  per cent chicken breast, perfect to nibble on by themselves or as a side - then itaposs time to turn up the heat. Popcorn Chicken Zinger is the same delicious chicken and moreish crunch, but KFC have pumped up the spice for those who can handle a kick.

Appearing on ITVaposs This Morning, he said : As she [Meghan] said herself, she didnapost read the tabloids, she didnapost watch TMZ. She learnt what she learnt about the Royal Family from Harry.

Later this month, an updated version of Meghan: A Hollywood Princess is being released with six new chapters. Among the new claims in the updated book are that Meghan and Harry thought a lovely picture of the Queen and her three heirs Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George wasunspoken code about their royal future and that they suspected the entire institution was conspiring against them. When it comes to Meghanaposs relationship with the Duchess of Cambridge, it is claimed that Kate didnapost have much energy to get to know and bond with Meghan in the lead up to the Sussex wedding as she was going through a dficult pregnancy with Louis. Morton also claims that despite the tensions and much-discussed row between the women at a bridesmaid dress fitting, Meghan bought Kate a bracelet to thank her for the wedding preparation help.

Staff at St Richardaposs CofE First School in Evesham, Worcester, didnapost even realise he was missing. The frightened reception pupil was found crying for his mum and soaked to the bone wearing just his PE kit in the torrential rain. Police were called and officers phoned around and drove to several local nurseries with Alfie before eventually ing him to the right school.  Furious mum Katrina Deegan, , is now demanding to know how her boy managed to escape from under the noses of oblivious school staff. Full-time mum-of-four Katrina, of Hampton, Evesham, said: Itaposs every parentaposs worst nightmare and anything could have happened to him.  Iaposve had no answers from the school how this was allowed to happen. He could have been taken or he could have been seriously hurt. Apparently he was in a really distressed state and running back and forth across a busy road before a woman found him and called police. I dread to think that my little boy could have been taken from me all under the schools watch where your supposed to leave your child with confidence thinking they are safe. The school was alerted after a local resident called police after finding Alfie sobbing and calling out for his mum as he tried to walk the mile journey back to his home. Alfie told his mum he had decided to walk out because a teacher had been horrible and shouted at him. Katrina added: When I got the phone call from the headteacher I panicked and was full of dread - I thought I was never going to see Alfie again. He said there had been a aposlittle bit of an incidentapos and that Alfie had gone missing and the police were on the way with him.  When youaposre told by a school there has been an incident you expect him to have fallen in the playground and bumped his head - not that he had gone missing. When the police turned up Alfie was so upset and distraught. He was soaked to the bone and must have bene terried. The officers had to drive him around nurseries and schools because he was in his PE kit rather than unorm so didnapost know where he was supposed to be. I asked Alfie why he left the school and he said because a teacher was being horrible to him and he wanted to come home to me. Heaposs like any other child, heaposs not naughty and doesnapost run away, he is usually as good as gold. I am so grateful someone kind found him because I dread to think what could have happened.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

If he had walked for five minutes more he would have been on a busy main road and the street he walked up is busy enough with speeding drivers. I was sat at home oblivious thinking my son is safe at school while he was walking around scared in the pouring rain. Officers took him round the local nurseries to try and find out where he had come from as he was wearing his PE kit and they could not identy the school. Mark Ridlinton, head teacher at St Richardaposs CofE First School, has apologised and said they are reviewing their procedures as well as investigating the incident. He said: We are extremely sorry that a child went missing during school hours and we are very grateful for West Mercia Police for their support during this incident and that the child was found safe and well.

This is really positive news for overall immunity levels in the UK and means that large numbers of people will have effective and long lasting protection from Covid A total of m people have had at least one dose of a Covid- jab since the NHSaposs biggest immunisation rollout began, while more than m people have had both doses. A booster jab roll out is also under way for some priority groups to boost their immunity as the winter approaches.

The NHS say the key symptoms to watch out for are new persistent cough, a high temperature and a loss of taste and smell. But a growing number of issues with skin are being reported across the world.Some sufferers have taken to Reddit to discuss their bodyaposs reaction to catching coronavirus.Experts say some of the symptoms suggested arenapost caused by the deadly bug itself, but by the inidualaposs immune response to the virus. On a growing subreddit called r Covidpositive, one woman claimed skin peeled off her hands after she caught the virus.Others added theyaposd had a similar experience - and some said both their hands and feet have been affected.Speaking to Vice, Kingaposs College London Professor Tim Spector said: It sounds similar to Covid toe, which is definitely real.It’s more commonly experienced on the toe but can involve the fingers. It looks like chilblains and it can also involve peeling skin. The ZOE app reported on this at a time when no one was and no one took it seriously.  It wasnapost the only skin complaint offered by users. Diana Pardo, , reported thatshe touched water her skin would shrivel up days before her Covid- infection was confirmed. Within minutes of showering, my hands became extremely prune-y, she said. Hives appears to be increasingly reported, with another woman saying her infection started with flu-like symptoms but then she became very itchy - especially her face and skin. Rebecca Lefevre, who was forced to call an ambulance, said the rash got so bad that the -year-oldaposs lips swelled up.  Others on the y thread say they experienced insomnia after contracting the virus.A new study have meanwhile found that Covid toes may be a side effect of the immune systemaposs response to fighting off the virus.The symptom results in chilblain-like inflammation and redness on the hands and feet, with the condition sometimes lasting for months at a time.With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

Crook, , shocked drivers over the course of five miles at around .am on October ,  as she reached speeds of almost mph. Chris Hopkins, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court that passing drivers used their lights and horns in a bid to get the attention of Crook.  Crook was seen driving westbound on the East Lancashire Road as she passed through Windle Island in St Helens. At the junction with Moorgate Road she entered the lane to turn right, only to continue straight and drive into oncoming traffic on the wrong side of the barrier separating the carriageways. Crook then turned down the M slip road, almost hitting a lorry head on before joining the motorway and driving at traffic heading in the opposite direction. The court heard the vehicle in front of Ms Kingdonaposs Honda Jazz swerved to get out of Crookaposs way, leaving the -year-old with no opportunity to avoid a crash. Shortly before the crash, one witness said: He could see her hands on the steering wheel. She was looking forward and appeared to be driving in a determined manner. Mr Hopkins said Crookaposs intentions remained unclear, but added: All of the evidence indicates this was a deliberate act and the only sensible conclusion that can be drawn is that the defendant was trying to harm herself.  Ms Kingdon and Crook both had to be cut out of their vehicles and taken to Aintree Hospital. Crook, of Cheviot Avenue in St Helens, spent time in a critical condition but survived. When interviewed by police, Crook said she had no recollection of the incident and suggested she had taken a wrong turn and panicked. Mr Hopkins said: The fact that that explanation is maintained by the defendant is something which has caused great distress to family members of the victim. The court heard Crook could offer no reason for a collection of photographs of motorway junctions, bridges and crash scenes that were recovered from her mobile phone. Mr Hopkins read a powerful statement on behalf of Stephen Sharples, the brother of Ms Kingdon. He detailed the compassion his sister displayed and the positive impact she had on so many lives through her work in education.  Ms Kingdon was from Merseyside but lived in Sheffield and had been the headteacher of Westfield Infants School, near Chesterfield, in Derbyshire. She was killed while she was driving home after visiting her Kirkby-based father-in-law, who she helped care for several days a week, and after having seen Liverpool FC play. Mr Sharples said: After a le time of devoting herself to others, Paula deserved the chance to enjoy her retirement... it is heartbreaking to me that Paula had this opportunity for a new chapter in her le taken away by the senseless actions of this stranger. Sarah Grfin, defending, said her client had previously been a woman of positive good character who had worked all her le, who is clearly dedicated to her children and is someone who could regularly be found helping family, friends and neighbours. Ms Grfin said Crook had not driven since the crash, and planned to never drive again.Judge Garrett Byrne addressed Ms Kingdonaposs family as he told the court: No sentence can restore Paula and no sentence can possibly compensate for her loss.The judge told Crook: The manner of your driving was such that it is dficult to think of a more serious case.He said: In my view the collision can be properly characterised as a deliberate act. You must have realised at the time that your driving was bound to cause someone at least serious harm,not their death. A letter written to Judge Byrne by Crook ended with her claiming she had no explanation for her actions. Highlighting the evidence that Crook made no attempt to avoid a crash, he concluded it was not a case of taking a wrong turn and then panicking, it was a deliberate course of conduct. The judge added that,it had been Crookaposs intention to harm herself, it was a profoundly selfish one because you were prepared to injure or kill others in achieving that goal. Crook admitted one count of causing death by dangerous driving. She was sentenced to four years and eight months and disqualied from driving for three years after her release.

The sisters, who both work at nearby Loan Agency Bridgewater Acceptances, say their cars have repeatedly been targeted. On Thursday Ellie claims she discovered a note stuck with silicone to the windscreen of her black Range Rover after she finished work. The note in black felt tip pen read: Please stop using this street as a car park. Residents are coming home from work shopping and can not park on their own street!! But Ellie said she and sister Jordana are perfectly within their rights to park there, as they both pay tax. She said: There are no yellow lines. We work in the area and this is what we pay road tax for. Our offices have been there  years. This has happened about four times. We have had our car scratched and around four notes left, stuck on with super glue, gaffer tape and now silicone. This is criminal damage.  According to the official RAC parking guide: It is perfectly legal to park outside someone’s house, unless the vehicle is blocking a driveway or a wheel is over a dropped kerb. Other situations in which parking isn’t permitted include streets governed by residents’ parking permits or any of the restrictions outlined above, i.e. double yellow lines.

Image: Kennedy News and MediaByAlahna KindredNews Reporter:,  Oct | commentsA carer who almost lost her hand to a  widow spider bite while she was in bed has been left so terried she sleeps on the living room sofa. Morgan Curran, , says she initially thought the spider bite was a harmless bug bite. However, days later, her right hand swelled like a boxing glove. It started to throb and a £ coin-sized black spot erupted underneath the knuckle on her middle finger. Morganaposs GP told her to go to AE where worried docs hooked her up to an IV drip and monitored the festering wound closely. After being pumped full of antibiotics, she remained in hospital for five days and underwent two operations to scoop out the infected tissue.  Morgan, who still fears she may get attacked again, is urging anyone who gets bit by a spider to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Doctors told Morgan she could have diedshe had not been treated in time. Morgan, from Oxfordshire, said: Iaposm OK with gory stuff but when they took the dressing off and I saw it I felt sick to my stomach.  It was hard to imagine that was on and inside me. At its biggest, my hand was like a boxing glove. It was completely puffed up and I couldnapost straighten my fingers because of all of the swelling. The relief of having everything bad taken out was less painful than while all the infection and pressure was building up. Once it had been cut open and the pressure was released it wasnapost too bad, but I was on strong painkillers.  Luckily they were able to [operate] without needing a skin graft. Iaposve always been a bit nervous of spiders anyway but itaposs a proper fear now that it could happen again. I think I was bitten while I was asleep because when I came home from the hospital there was a spider under my windowsill that looked a bit aggressive.  Iaposm convinced that was the one that had me - it had the skull-type shape on its back. Even nowI see the tiniest spider it has to be gone before I can get into bed. If I see one that Iaposve lost in my room Iaposll come down and sleep on the sofa because itaposs just too scary to sleep in there.  Morgan woke up one morning in April  with an itchy hand, initially thinking the pinhead-sized lump was a regular bug bite and popped a couple of antihistamines. Over the next two days, the lump ballooned and turned black in the centre. When she initially went to the pharmacy she was told to go to AE but left it until the next day because she had a concert that night. At the concert Morganaposs hand continued to swell, she suffered an intense burning and throbbing pain and booked a GP appointment for the following day.  The doctor referred her to John Radclfe Hospital in Oxford and there they hooked her up to an antibiotic IV drip, soaked her hand in iodine baths and eventually performed surgery to scoop out the infected tissue. After five days in the hospital, she was discharged and changed the bandages daily until the wound healed. Morgan said: The doctor said it was full of infection and thatIaposd left it much longer I could have possibly lost my hand, got sepsis or worst-case scenario - I could have lost my le.Morgan is now urging anyone who gets bitten to get wounds checked out sooner rather than later. Morgan said: It took a very long time to heal. I went back to work after five weeks but there was still a small wound there. I have a constant numbness like pins and needles and when itaposs cold I get a dull pain there. If I knock it on something it hurts more thanI were to knock my other hand on something. I definitely wish Iaposd got it checked out sooner rather than later, it might not have been so serious. Morgan now checks her bed every night before she climbs between the sheets andshe canapost locate a spider sheaposs spotted she sleeps on the sofa. Morgan said: I check the bedding before I get into bed now. Every time I walk into the room I check the corners for anything. Some nights I canapost sleep in there so I go into the living room and sleep on the sofa. Itaposs usually because Iaposve seen a spider, tried to get it but itaposs fallen and I canapost find it. My advice to anyone who is bitten is to get it checked because the pain is unreal, and unbearable. Itaposs just not worth having the surgery, the pain and a constant numbness.

Arthur, who in the s became the world’s first black professional footballer, gave his wages to the needy. The sportsman, regarded as the best goalie in Britain in his day, is inspiring a new generation of stars, including England striker Marcus Rashford who campaigns on child food poverty. Shaun Campbell, a businessman who set up the Arthur Wharton Foundation, said: “Arthur was a remarkable man. “Andyou think of what Marcus is doing today, Arthur was doing the same more than  years ago.  “Back then he was thinking of the poor. He was a black champion in his community. All those years ago he played and gave his time and wages for others. “There is a certain irony that all these years later, Marcus Rashford is doing the same thing. “It is sad that we still have these cases of children in need.”  Fans loved Arthur’s athleticism and showmanship. He became a box office star when professional football was in its infancy. Arthur was born in Accra in the Gold Coastin West Africa in . His mum was descended from the Fante royal family, and his dad was born in the West Indies, the son of a wealthy Scottish trader.The UK began celebrating Black History Month, an idea first spawned in the United States and then also adopted by European countries including Ireland and the Netherlands, in October . Black History Month helps give context to modern le and the countryaposs history, while championing the experiences and celebrating the contributions of Black Britons here in the UK. The observation was first organised through the leadership of Ghanaian-born analyst Akyaaba Addai-Sebo. He served as a coordinator of special projects for the Greater London Council. Consequently, Akyaaba created a plan aiming to recognise the contributions of African, Asian and Caribbean people to the economic, cultural and political le in the UK. Arthur moved to England aged  in the early-s to train as a Methodist missionary. But he decided instead to become a full-time athlete – excelling in numerous sports. Arthur, based in Darlington in Co Durham, joined Darlington FC in . A year later he broke the -yard world record, finishing the race in exactly  seconds. The record stood for over  years. His athletics achievements have wowed none other than Jamaican star Usain Bolt.  The eight-time Olympic gold medal sprinter told Shaun: “Without Arthur, there would be no Usain Bolt.” Arthur became a pro footballer with Rotherham Town in . At Sheffield United in -, the keeper became the first player of mixed heritage to play in the top flight of English football. At the time, players at the club could earn about £ a week . There were also win bonuses, usually of up to  shillings. The average weekly wage of a working man was £. Arthur, whose career lasted until , also played for Preston North End and Stockport County. He was also a cycling champ, and a fine cricketer and rugby player. He is an inspiration to a host of today’s stars. Those who have sent a video message to the Arthur Wharton Foundation – which promotes equality and champions his le – include Bolt, Rashford, Les Ferdinand and Stevie Wonder. Many footballers had not heard of Arthur before the foundation was set up. Viv Anderson, who in  became the first black player to represent England in a full international, learned about him through an exhibition at the National Football Museum in . He said: “I didn’t know his story until then – and I was a black professional footballer.” Arthur died penniless aged  in . There is now a ft statue of him at the FA’s HQ in Burton, Staffs. And in  he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame. Man United star Rashford has a giant mural in his hometown – just like the one unveiled in Darlington for Arthur. With sporting prowess as well as a social conscience, Arthur’s exploits on and off the pitch mean his legacy will live on.

Thereaposs no indication yet whether they will make the same request in the UK.It comes amid a spike in the number of Covid infections among younger people in the US, with them hitting the highest point in the pandemic in early September, according to data from the American Academy of Pediatrics.The FDA has set a date of Oct  for outside advisers to meet and discuss the Pfizer application, making it possible forkids to begin receiving the vaccines shortly afterwards. What are your thoughts on this  Let us know in the comments below A rapid authorisation could help mitigate a potential surge of cases this fall, with schools already open nationwide. The vaccine, which is already authorised in  to  year olds and fully approved for ages  and up, has been shown to induce a strong immune response in the target age group in a , participant clinical trial, the companies said on September . The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorised in kids aged - roughly a month after the companies filed for authorisation. While kids are less susceptible to severe COVID-, they can spread the virus to others, including vulnerable populations that are more at risk of severe illness.  In the UK one dose of the jab was approved for kids aged  and over in mid-September. The UKaposs four Chief Medical Officers at the time recommended a universal rollout of the Pfizer jab to children aged  to  after judging it will help prevent schools chaos over winter. All UK over-s are already able to get the jab, with  and -year-olds getting an initial one dose instead of two. Under previous rules, -s could only get itthey were in vulnerable groups.

Ms Lutali received a letter from the University of Colorado Hospital saying she would be removed from the transplant list unless she begins the vaccine process within  days. The letter, which has been shared on social media, reads: The transplant team at University of Colorado Hospital has determined that it is necessary to place you inactive on the waiting list. You will be inactivated on the list for non-compliance by not receiving the COVID vaccine. You will have  days to begin the vaccination series. What do you think  Let us know in the comments below  If your decision is to refuse COVID vaccination you will be removed from the kidney transplant list. You will continue to accrue waiting time but you will not receive a kidney offer while listed inactive. Once you complete the COVID vaccination series you will be reactivated on the kidney transplant list pending any other changes in your health condition. Ms Lutali, who has stage five renal failure, said she feels coerced to get the coronavirus vaccine even though she does not feel ready for it. She told KOAA TV: I feel coerced. I feel like my le is being held in their hands in exchange for a shot, and the attitude is just take the shot. She added: I said Iaposll sign a medical waiver. I have to sign a waiver anyway for the transplant itself, releasing them from anything that could possibly go wrong. aposItaposs surgery, itaposs invasive. I sign a waiver for my le. Iaposm not sure why I canapost sign a waiver for the COVID shot.Ms Fougner, who has not received a Covid jab for religious reasons, told CBS : Here I am, willing to be a direct donor to her. It does not affect any other patient on the transplant list.How can I sit here and allow them to murder my friend when Iaposve got a perfectly good kidney and can save her le  Tim Geitner, a Republican state representative from El Paso County, Colorado, said he has contacted UCHealth to get them to provide an exception, Denver reports.He said: The understanding is basically… conform to this demand. Take this COVID vaccine or otherwise you will be denied a le-saving procedure. He added: There is very little that UCHealth is prepared to do... an exemption to policy or a change in policy or accommodating or anything . The women are now reportedly looking for another hospital to perform the transplant, but have not found one yet.  UCHealth said in a statement that it aims to provide the best care for patients and that now transplant recipients, as well as living donors, are required to be vaccinated against Covid- as part of the health requirements needed for the procedure. The health system added: Surgeries may be postponed until patients take all required precautions in order to give them the best chance at positive outcomes. According to UCHealth, transplant patients are more likely to diethey contract Covid-. In the US, it is estimated  people die every day while waiting for an organ transplant, according to Health Resources  Services Administration.Every nine minutes a new person is added to the transplant waiting list, the website explains. It adds that , transplants were performed in the US in . UCHealth said in a statement: An organ transplant is a unique surgery that leads to a letime of specialized management to ensure an organ is not rejected, which can lead to serious complications, the need for a subsequent transplant surgery, or even death. Physicians must consider the short- and long-term health risks for patients as they consider whether to recommend an organ transplant. Transplant centers across the nation, including the UCHealth Transplant Center, have specic requirements in place to protect patients both during and after surgery. For example, patients may be required to receive vaccinations including hepatitis B, MMR and others. Patients may also be required to avoid alcohol, stop smoking, or prove they will be able to continue taking their anti-rejection medications long after their transplant surgery. These requirements increase the likelihood that a transplant will be successful and the patient will avoid rejection. In almost all situations, transplant recipients and living donors at UCHealth are now required to be vaccinated against COVID- in addition to meeting other health requirements and receiving additional vaccinations. Some U.S. transplant centers already have this requirement in place, and others are making this change in policy now.Patients who have received a transplanted organ are at signicant risk from COVID-. Should they become infected, they are at particularly high risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death. Studies have found transplant patients who contract COVID- may have a mortality rate of % or higher. A living donor could pass COVID- infection on to an organ recipient eventhey initially test negative for the disease, putting the patient’s le at risk.

But wait, you#re in Aberdeen.Yes, you read right. Not Paris, Amsterdam or Norway. Aberdeen.It has been done before. And successfully more to the point.You just need to look at the likes of The Chester Hotel and its winter wonderland last year with weekend reservations booked out weeks in advance.Its alfresco offering went down a storm andanything, is proof that there is an appetite for alfresco dining during the colder months.Yes there were heaters and yes everyone wrapped up warm, but did a winter chill stop us in our tracks from celebrating Scottish hospitality  It certainly didn#t.So why do we Scots throw the towel in as soon as the temperatures begin to plummet  Especially now that the concept has been tried and tested to great success.Locations across Europe do it, and so can we.In terms of Aberdeen, I can say with absolute certainty that one phoenix that has arisen from the ashes during the pandemic is the introduction of more outdoor drinking and dining areas.They have proved a leline for businesses that would have had next to no other ways of making income .Beer gardens near me: Interactive map shows the pubs reopening in Aberdeen and AberdeenshireThe options for anyone wanting to eat alfresco pre-pandemic in the city were near non-existent unless heading to the beach.Restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars were unable to seat customers indoors when hospitality was given the green light to reopen in July , and so ersied and invested in alfresco seating areas.Businesses erected tents, got their hands on picnic benches and set up shop. And while some were and remain bigger than others, these spots have brought the city to le.Independent hospitality group PB Devco, the owners of Soul, took over part of the site at the former Bruce Millers music store on Union Street last summer.They turned it into a new outdoor venue known as The Draft Project and also erected a sheltered beer garden which remains open on Bon Accord Street while the street is temporarily closed.The Draft Project was planned to be launched as a temporary pop-up # lasting around two months # from August , however, given its popularity, it remains open, a year longer than originally anticipated.While it has seen ious challenges in its time including a TV ban following issues arising at the bar around the time of the Euros, it is promising to see the council and locals get behind the venue to keep it open.The same success could be said for the venues in Aberdeen hospitality operator, The McGinty#s Group#s, portfolio which have been transformed to feature outdoor drinking and dining areas.They include The Fourmile in Kingswells, No.  Bar  Restaurant on Queen#s Terrace, The Grill on Union Street, and Ferryhill House Hotel on Bon Accord Street.All of these venues# alfresco offering have remained, with no plans to remove them announced.With Covid cases recently on the rise and more iniduals picking up bugs and getting ill, is now really the time to close these areas which provide additional space for punters and a bit more fresh air I#d like to think many other diners would relish in the chance to eat outside # albeit with a heater or two to hand.There#s also the Christmas market to consider now, with more alfresco dining options hopefully popping up when it takes shape.With some still apprehensive about heading out, is it right to be restricted to solely indoor service We#re already seeing local pop-ups closing down ahead of the winter season, Backyard Beach Collective at Codona#s and The Bike Yard included, with little to no reasoning behind it # other than the weather.Yes, it#s a tad colder, but that doesn#t deter us from eating outside.

Before it was lovely and it had some period furniture, but it wasn’t as used as we would have liked.“A lot of amazing people have done amazing things, not just in Aberdeen but out in the wider world, and we felt it was time Aberdeen, going from being quite quiet and not wanting to shout about itself, actually put itself on the world stage with a big voice.”The new exhibition, which fills  rooms of the th-century building, includes some of the most recognisable names from the north-east – both past and present.Illustrator Johanna Basford, Olympic swimmer Hannah Miley and writer Stuart MacBride, who attended an event at the house ahead of its reopening, each described their inclusions as “a great honour”.“You don’t realise how many amazing people have come from our city and shire,” Ms Basford added.“It’s something I am hugely proud of and I can’t wait to show my kids.”Work on the house was delayed by the Covid- pandemic, which brought the country to a halt last year and pushed the opening date back several months.But despite the delays, Ms Boulton – who earlier defended the work amid criticism from opposition councillors – said the local authority had “pushed every boundary” to get the job done.“The slight delay probably hasn’t had that much of an impact really in terms of getting people through the door,” she said.“They have managed their way through it and it’s absolutely phenomenal.“I think people will have to come back several times to take in a fraction of the information because there is just so much. I just hope people love it as much as I do.”Entry to Provost Skene’s House will be free and its opening hours will be Monday-Saturday am-pm and Sunday am-pm.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/MicrosoftTeams-image-22-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland here are the key demographics","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe’ve put together some regularly updating charts and maps showing the demographic information available on the people affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Scotland.The charts below show the distribution of deaths by age and gender.Given the way the virus transmits, we also looked at whether there was any link between the fatality rate and the population density.The NRS provides information on the number of deaths by smaller areas, known as intermediate zones, once per month.The chart below shows the proportion of deaths by location.This chart shows Covid- as a proportion of deaths each week in Scotland.The animated chart below shows where Covid- sits in the ranks of leading causes of death in Scotland.Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# #

We have had a taste of it now.“We want to go and play in the biggest tournament in the world.“We have another big chance.“We have a massive game at home at the weekend.“It is a sell-out and I think that is the proof of what we are doing.“It is the first time in a long time we have managed to sell Hampden out and that speaks volumes about what everyone at Scotland has done to get to this point.#We have to pay back this loyalty. We have to go and put a big performance on and try to get out of this group and get to a play-off and hopefully another major tournament.”Clarke’s squad head into the match on the back of last month’s morale-boosting - win in Austria, which has put the Scots in the driving seat to finish second behind runaway group leaders Denmark.Cooper said: “That result means nothingwe don’t now go and win these next two games.“It was an unbelievable result, andyou want to do anything in the group you need to beat those so-called better teams in the group.“We’ve managed to do that in Vienna. It was an unbelievable result, but it’s in the past now.“That would be a wastewe don’t go and win these next two games, and that’s all we are focused on doing.”This will be the seventh meeting between Scotland and Israel in the past three years and Cooper feels he knows exactly what to expect from Saturday’s opponents.He said: “The good thing for us is that there’s not too much analysing to do. We know how they play.“I think  or  percent of the squads I’ve been in we’ve played Israel!“We don’t have to over-analyse too much. We know what they are all about and that’s the same for them.“The games have always been tight against them. I don’t think I can remember a game off the top of my head when there’s been more than one goal in it.“May the better team win. We’ll be coming with everything, we’ve got a full Hampden behind us and it’s going to be a very good spectacle I think.”Cooper, meanwhile, has backed the introduction of VARin Scottish football.SPFL clubs will meet this Friday to discuss the technology’s introduction in all top tier games and the latter rounds of cup competitions.Cooper said:  “I think it adds to the game.“As professionals we all crave the right results, and the right outcome.“I have been involved in a couple of decisions. There was the penalty , having seen it back it probably was a penalty, but there was definitely two players at it.“I was sent off away at Man City last year because of VAR, but on my behalf I won the ball and came into contact with Gabriel Jesus afterwards. I am not sure how you stop momentum when you go and win a tackle, but these things are never going to be perfect.“We all crave the right decision. More times than not VAR does that. It is just hard to get used to at the start. I think everyone would welcome better decisions in the game.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 17 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Our health and social care system is under severe pressure in the pandemic # from GP practices to carers and hospital services to ambulances.We#ve never seen anything resembling the unrelenting demands placed on hard-pressed ambulance crews.They keep smiling through it and are a credit to their profession.

The P  team drew six tries-all and the P- team won by six tries to four.Next they played Kintyre with the P s losing by five tries to two and the P s winning again four tries to three.The last game for both teams came against Oban and this time the P  team won by three tries to one and the superb P  team won by five tries to three to complete a clean sweep on the day.Lee Buckley of Mid Argyll RFC said: #The coaches at Mid Argyll would like to thank two under- players, Donald Self and William Wilson, who came along on the day and refereed all the games.#I think the boys were surprised by the quality of the rugby and the speed of some of the mini players, as they tried to keep up with them.#During the day Argyll and Bute rugby development officer Andrew Johnston took all the girl players aside to record a good luck message for the Scotland women#s national team who took on Spain the following day in a crucial world cup qualying match.The message must have done the trick as Scotland ran out  #  victors to keep their world cup dream alive.If any young people would like to play rugby either as a ing player or a complete novice, training sessions for all primary age children and S- high school girls is at pm on Tuesdays on the rugby pitch at the joint campus in Lochgilphead.High School training for S- boys and girls is held on Thursdays at pm at the joint campus.For any ing ex-players or novice adults, men and women who want to give rugby a try for the first time, have a look on Mid Argyll Rugby Club#s Facebook page for details of when the #old-timers# touch rugby sessions are being held.This week#s Dalriada festival on September  is being hosted by Oban Lorne RFC.Players should arrive at Oban Rugby Club no later than .am for a noon start.PICS:Mid Argyll P  team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllMid Argyll P  team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllDonald and William refereed the games. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllThe girls had a great day # and even recorded a good luck message for the Scotland women#s national team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllAction from the P  match between Mid Argyll and Etive Vikings, which Mid Argyll won by six tries to four.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status. Our greatness is revealed in our service and care of others.Max is doing well, by the way, and I can hardly wait to see him again.God bless you and yours, from biggest to littlest, today and always."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 24 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.We would like to add our best wishes to Mr Peter Ciarella on reaching his th birthday.He is undoubtedly one of the best-known and loved people in the district, and his contribution to Lochgilphead over the decades is immeasurable.It#s amazing how the foresight and hard work of dferent groups of people, working independently for their own particular areas of interest, have resulted in a number of improvement schemes coming to fruition at the same time.Mid Argyll is looking forward to the completion of projects to upgrade the Lochgilphead swimming pool, front green and Kilmartin Museum.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn. Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces, and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is Heuchera.Native to north America, Heuchera were originally grown for their flowers # dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and wpring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"glendaruel hosts tighnabruaich open","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowGlendaruel and Colintraive Gun Club hosted the Tighnabruaich Open on September , the first club competition to be held since March .The High Gun of the day, after a three-way shoot off, was Ted Blakeway.In second was Alan Brown third, Paul Chalmers and fourth equal were Martin Young,  Gordon Grfiths and Eric McAllister.The ladies prize went to Jessica Young.

How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings.

No changes to the current rulesNicola Sturgeon confirmed that there would be no changes to the \"albeit, limited regulations\" still in place in Scotland.This is because, according to the first minister, the numbers have continued to fall.However, she also said that despite falling cases, the infection rate still remainsrelatively high which is of concern as we head into the winter months.It is for this reason that the current limited measures, such as mask wearing,will remain in place in Scotland.Explaining this, the first minister said: \"the level of infection, though falling, remains relatively high and so we consider that it is prudent at this stage, as we approach winter, to keep in place the remaining mitigations, face coverings for example, for a further period.\".

What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings. It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning. A true work of art woven with such delicacy.In the bible we read this: #Go watch the ants, you lazy person. Watch what they do and be wise. Ants have no commander, no leader or ruler, but they store up food in the summer and gather their supplies at harvest.# From this we can learn four things helpful to living: be diligent and hard-working have an #I can do it# attitude plan ahead remember teamwork is important."},{"url":null,"title":"action packed day for young soccer stars","story":"It was a welcometo action for more than  young footballers from across Argyll and Lochaber when Lochnell Football Club held its fth football festival at North Connel at the weekend.Postponed from last year, the popular event attracted  teams across six primary school age groups, with fun fours and five-a-sides for younger children in the morning followed by keenly contested seven-a-side matches for older players in the afternoon.After a day of non-stop action, each player richly deserved their commemorative medal, provided by Anderson Banks Solicitors and Estate Agents, sponsors of the festival for the second year.Lochnell Football Club greatly appreciates the continued support of the local firm and also thanked all visiting teams, coaches, parents and referees for making the day such a resounding success."},{"url":null,"title":"lambs sell well at islay sheep sale","story":"Breeding sheep of all classes sold well.At the show prior to the sale, the judge, Mr R Blackhall, Milton of Durris, Banchory, selected a Bluefaced Leicester shearling from Daniel McMillan, Tallant as his champion which later sold for £ to Islay Estates.His reserve champion was a Blackface shearling from Elliot Bowman, Mid Craggabus, which later sold for £, also to Islay Estates.In keeping with other principal centres, lambs took a considerable rise on the previous sale and this would undoubtedly be one of dearest sales of lambs held at Bridgend.Leading lots and prices:Lambs: SUFFx # £, Uiskentuie £, Islay Estates £, Bola Na Traigh £, Ardbeg £., Rockside £, Islay Estates £., Duich £., Ballimartin £, Dunlossit, Lossit £, Coultorsay £, Ardbeg £, Smaladh £, Uiskentuie £, Islay Estates £., Rockside £, Islay Estate £, Coultorsay £, Islay Estate £, Ardnave £, Ballinaby £, Duich £, Coultorsay £, Islay Estates. LLEYNx: £, Ardbeg. TEXx: £, Blackrock £, Uiskentuie £, Ballivicar £, Mansefield £, Ballimartin £, Stanalane £, Dunlossit, Lossit £., Ardbeg £, Auchnaclach £, Starchmill £, Coultorsay £, Starchmill £, Ardbeg. CHEV: £, Grulinbeg £, Tormisdale Croft £., Ardfarnal £., Tormisdale Croft £, Sealladh Na Mara. CROSS: £, Mansefield £, Ardtalla Estate. MULE: £, Islay Estate £, Ballytarsin £, Islay Estates £, Duich £, Smaladh. BF # £, £, Islay Estate £., Ceannacroic £, Lossit Dunlossit £, Islay Estates £., Kelsay.Rams:  SUFF: £, £, Coille £, Eorrabus £,  Claddach. BFL: £, Tallant£, Beamish Croft £ x , £, Coille £, Eorrabus £, Coille £, Eorrabus. BELT: £, £, Bayview £, Stanalane. CHEV: £, Ballivicar.

promoted to lieutenant-general and, just before the  Rising, he was appointed military commander in Scotland.After Prince Charles and his men had landed at Eriskay, Cope withdrew to Inverness, leaving Edinburgh exposed.The Prince lost no time before he entered the Capital in triumph with his army of Highlanders, rough types who were capable of anything.After Cope had loaded his troops onto ships at Aberdeen and sailed for Dunbar, the two armies met at Prestonpans on September , .Many of Copersquos troops were inexperienced recruits and his officers were a feeble lot.Early the following morning, when the Highlanders charged, Copersquos dragoons fled in panic, leaving the infantry exposed.Had the humane Prince and his officers not interceded, a bloodbath might well have have ensued, with no prisoners taken.The craven Cope fled to Berwick-upon-Tweed with some of his officers and a rabble of surviving soldiers.He faced a court martial but was exonerated, the cowardly conduct of the soldiers being blamed for everything.He obtained another appointment as Governor of Limerick but never held an independent field command again.There was an early rumour among the Scottish victors that Sir John Cope had overslept on the morning of the battle although it inspired the rousing bagpipe tune Hey, Johnnie Cope, Are Ye Waking Yet , that version of events is not true.Then there was a story that although Prince Charles had spent the night before the battle on duty with his men, Cope had slept at comfortable quarters in Cockenzie.This tale was reported by the Edinburgh historian Robert Chambers as early as , although Copersquos  biographer Sir Robert Cadell found it yet another calumny: in spite of the assertions of Chambers and others, Cope had slept with his troops on the battlefield, as veried by the Culloden Papers and the Proceedings of Copersquos court martial.In his  biography of Prince Charles, the mischievous W.

The card had superior artistic merit and I wanted to make use of it in the book, which was to include a number of old cards by the celebrated North Berwick postcard artist Reginald Phillimore.The problem, however, was that no information was forthcoming where this obscure cottage had been or how it had earnt sufficient fame to be depicted by Phillimore.The book was published in  without lsquoCleikum Tollrsquo being featured.The purchase of another Edwardian postcard belatedly solved the mystery in August : it turned out that the careless Phillimore had got the name wrong, since it was not lsquoCleikum Tollrsquo but lsquoCleikimin Tollrsquo!And indeed, inquiries demonstrated that this turnpike and tollhouse had been standing at the cross between the road from Dunbar to Spott and the road from Broxburn to Belton. It is likely there were two turnpikes, one on each road. The tollhouse was said to be very old, quite possibly constructed in the first half of the th century.In early Victorian times, the tollgate system kept flourishing all over Britain. In rural west Wales, there were full-scale riots in  after a number of novel turnpikes had been erected, something the locals disapproved of. Men dressed as women attacked the turnpikes and beat up the tollkeepers, and it was only with dficulty they could be pacied.Cleikimin Toll was spared such indignities, however: it was still operational at the time of the Ordnance Survey of -. The name-book of this survey [OS    ] refers to it as a ldquoA Toll Bar at a junction of roads situated about half a mile south of the town of Dunbar.A note explains Cleikimin as a name usually applied to a cheap public house, where a Cleik [Scottish for fish-hook] was supposed to have been made use of to pull the customers inside.The arrival of the railways did much damage to the old tollgate system all over Britain: as a result, the road toll revenue plummeted and the tollkeepers grumbled incessantly.The Scottish municipal authorities realised the old-fashioned turnpikes were on the way out, and by  they were all gone.The tollhouse at Cleikimin Toll stood well into Edwardian times, being admired as a quaint relic of olden days. It survived the Great War but was destroyed not long after in a scheme for widening the A.

There was year upon year of company re-investment of profits, a workforce willing to forgo todays wage boost for ldquojam tomorrow. What Mr Johnson is invoking is high inflation, stoked by shortages of goods and staff. With the UK heading back to the joys of the s, this makes Mr Johnson not Tony Benn, but James Callaghan, another populist, out-of-his-depth leader. ldquoCrisis, what crisis GR Weir, Ochiltree.ALISTER JACK OUT OF STEPIT is great that the Prime Minister now wishes to push forward towards a high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity and yes, low-tax economy. However I cannot be the only person in Scotland who wonders why this cant be reconciled with a real living wage in the proposed green ports in Scotland. The Secretary of State for Scotland has said that these high wages would make them uncompetitive .Possibly the PM should have a word with him Foster Evans, Renfrew.DANGER IN THE ELECTIONS BILLJILL Stephensonis to be commended for her directness in insisting that in the event of another referendum the Union side should have the advantage of question wording. However, her justication that ldquoYes had the advantage in practice stands up to little scrutiny, as the question used was the one recommended by the Electoral Commission. Moreover, having mentioned that a Remain  Leave question was shown by Professors Ford, Johns and Garry to advantage ldquoNo, Ms Stephenson concludes: ldquoAs a matter of balance, in any future referendum, the question should be \"Should Scotland remain in the UK  Yes or No\". I think we can draw our own conclusions from that.However, more important is Ms Stephensonrsquos focus on the Electoral Commission, whose aim is to ensure ldquoUK elections remain secure, fair, modern, inclusive and transparent. However, there are proposals in the Elections Bill, for a Strategy and Policy Statement for the Electoral Commission, which will set out the Governmentrsquos priorities on electoral matters and principles under which the commission will be expected to operate. While this must be approved by Parliament, it will be prepared by the Secretary of State, currently Michael Gove. The commission itself has said the proposals will ldquoplace a fetter on the commission which would limit its activity.Thus, the organisation charged with ensuring that any question for a second referendum is fair and not misleading will be under the control of one of the parties in the referendum debate. Perhaps Ms Stephenson will even get her way with the question for the next referendum, eventhrough the unfair, prejudicial, and undemocratic means contained in the Elections Bill.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.THE ONLY HONEST QUESTIONTHERE is endless quibbling about how the simple answers \"yes\" or \"no\" might give advantage or disadvantage to those voting in a referendum .There are important decisions made every day by governments, management boards and committees on the basis of votes cast for a motion or against it. No one ever suggests that there is bias in favour of the supporters.If we ignore the bias implied by such inaccurate phrases as \"secession\", \"separatism\" or \"leaving the UK\", the only honest and historically justiable question for a referendum would be \"Should Scotland become an independent nation again \"Peter Dryburgh, Edinburgh.* A NUMBER of your correspondents have discussed the nature of the question to be put in any putative future Indyref.However, it has been clear since  that the only referendum result that nationalists will accept is one in favour of secession from the UK. Therefore their preferred format for a future referendum ballot paper would surely be ldquoDo you agree that Scotland must leave the UK whatever the cost And a box marked ldquoYes.And thatrsquos all.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.THE PRICE OF POVERTYBRIAN Wilson tells us that poverty matters . Indeed poverty does matter. The \"rape clause\" and the bedroom tax would not have been visited on Scotlands poorest familiesit had not been for Westminster rule by a Government rejected by the Scottish electorate.These, and other reactionary \"hostile\" measures such as racist immigration laws, are no doubt regretted by some supporters of the Union but the huge cost to our poorest families is, it would seem, a price that wealthy Union supporters are willing for the most vulnerable to pay.Brian Dempsey, Lecturer, School of Law, University of Dundee.COVID HANDLED BETTER HEREADAM Tomkinswill be disappointed to learn that on Tuesday, the Welsh Senedd also agreed to introduce vaccine passports and this is commonplace throughout Europe, as it is seen as a vital tool in encouraging the uptake of vaccines and to protect those who frequent crowded nightclubs and large sporting events.Nicola Sturgeonrsquos far superior handling of the health crisis in Scotland has resulted in Scotland having lower cases and deaths per head of population plus a greater number of jags administered compared to England, thanks to our much-better-performing NHS.It could be argued that the Scottish position would be even betterwe had had control of our borders and the fiscal powers required to introduce an earlier lockdown, rather than relying on Boris Johnsonrsquos fatal dithering that trashed our economy and resulted in the UK having the worst death rate and the highest number of cases per head of population in Europe, when as an island we should have had the lowest rates.Tories continually fail to recognise the four dferent health services in the UK, and on June  a House of Lords committee found that Mr Johnsons use of the Union Flag as a backdrop for coronavirus briefings caused \"unacceptable and unnecessary\" confusion, which is amplied by BBC Scotland allowing opposition politicians to immediately undermine the Scottish Governmentrsquos health briefings ndash a practice that is not followed by the BBC where in the UK.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.THERE IS NO IDENTITY CRISISI WISH to commend Willie Macleanrsquos stunningly clear analysis of the Scottish British national identity . When it comes to football , I am Scottish. When it comes to world war, I am British. That analysis could provide the basis of a rational, flags absent, debate over what happens in the grey area between these two positions.My Scottish identity, for example, prevails in many issues other than football and includes our legal system, our education system, our sense of humour and many others.Michael Sheridan, Glasgow.A POLITICAL MISMATCHPRIOR to reading todays Herald , my eyes were drawn to the front page, just above your main headline. \"Ross v Sturgeon\" it read, promoting an article within the pages.My immediate instincts were to imagine a sporting comparison.

The gas is to stun animals for slaughter and in packaging to prolong shelf le.CF produces around % of the UKs CO supply, which is why the closure of the sites had prompted fears that shoppers could start noticing shortages in poultry, pork and bakery products within days.A fire at Britainrsquos main electricity subsea cable with France last month has further prompted concerns over electricity supplies this winter. The fire will reduce imports from France until the end of March , the National Grid has admitted.Prices of natural gas, which had already been at record highs in the previous weeks soared more than  per cent at the news.Gas production has also been  per cent lower in the UK so far this year because companies have been carrying out maintenance that was delayed due to the pandemic.The turbulance in the energy market has also been compounded by some of the lowest wind speeds since the s, which has dramatically cut output from the UKs , wind turbines. And there have been outages at some of Britainrsquos nuclear plants.Speaking ahead of the publication today of the National Grids official winter outlooks Mr Pettigrew told the FT: ldquoAs always you need to monitor those things because things can happen during the winter.\" That included including unforeseen power station closures and liquefied natural gas deliveries being erted to other parts of the world.He has said that Britain had multiple potential sources of gas, including imports from Norway as well as domestic supply from the North Sea.But he acknowledged that it would have to compete on price with other parts for the world, in particular Asia, for other sources such as liquefied natural gas.From this month, the three in four customers on default tarf customers paying by direct debit will see an increase of pound from pound, to pound,, while the rest who are on prepayment meters will see a rise of pound from pound, to pound,.Analysts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted the next cap will mean the typical household will rise by a further pound to pound, and the impact of the crisis could be felt into .\"The explosion of choice and innovation seen in the sector in the last decade has been fundamentally altered in a matter of months, and while all eyes will inevitably be on this winter, the need for an enduring solution to ensure that the gains experienced by almost three decades of competition are not lost,\" said its senior consultant, Craig Lowrey.Earlier on Wednesday, the UK gas price traded as high as p a therm. The trading price was p a therm at the start of the year.Jonathan Brearley, the boss of Ofgem, has warned that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmPolice are set to carry out additional patrols of Kirkwall town centre, as antisocial behaviour continues to plague the area around the Travel Centre.

Proposals also include “active travel” routes, e-bike chargers and welcome facilities, alongside coach permits and charging at some car parks.The programme is being funded with joint investment of up to £. million from the Scottish Government and UK Government, as part of the Islands Growth Deal — a ten-year investment programme jointly funded by the UK and Scottish governments, the three island councils and their partners from the public, academic and business sectors.During the in-person sessions, due to take place next Tuesday and Wednesday, attendees will be guided through proposals with representatives from project partners.OIC leader, Councillor James Stockan, said: “The Islands Deal commitment we have from the Scottish and UK Governments to support the Orkney Gateway is hugely gratying and reflects the position our World Heritage Site holds as one of the jewels in Scotland’s and indeed the UK’s tourism crown — not to mention the global archaeological signicance of the site.“But we must remember that at the core of this is a landscape and series of monuments which for many Orcadians is a direct, mysterious and powerful link to their past. And we know equally they are held very dear by people who’ve moved into these islands over the years.“So, as partners, we are all very clear that we want to gather local people’s views on the range of options that we could bid for through our final Islands Deal business case.”The consultation events are scheduled for Tuesday, October , at Maeshowe Visitor Centre, Stenness, from pm to pm, and Wednesday, October , at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, from pm until pm.If you’re unable to attend these events, further information is available at www.orkney.gov.uk orkneygateway.

We are committed to ensuring our people who keep our communities connected are properly rewarded, particularly after their contribution to the country over the past  months of the pandemic.“We have worked tirelessly to protect the jobs of our people during the pandemic and done everything we reasonably can to hold constructive discussions with Unite to reach a sensible and sustainable pay agreement across our bus depots.“We are leaving no stone unturned in a bid to reach a settlement. That is why we are putting a fresh pay offer to Unite in talks scheduled to take place next week.”According to Stagecoach, bus services are facing a continuing challenging financial environment with passenger levels signicantly down on pre-COVID levels. Passenger fares are signicantly short of what is needed to cover the day-to-day costs of running services without Scottish Government support.Mr Beaton added: “We would urge Unite to end the uncertainty for our people and the customers who rely on bus services.“Strike action is completely unnecessary and would simply damage the lives and livelihoods of hard-working people, including our employees, as well as the region’s businesses.#We would urge Unite to put communities first and talk, not walk.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The least you can do is ensure a hot meal at their school for their children.ldquoFor months you and your fellow ministers have been warned about the effects the shortage crisis could have on our economy and our everyday lives, now we see this reality coming true. For you to not have this on your radar is both surprising and a shocking abduction of leadership. vw,vw,px, px\"Empty shelves are seen in the meat aisle of a supermarket two weeks ago Ms Green has called for a plan to recruit and train more HGV drivers to ease the supply issues, adding: ldquoNo school must be left without the food supplies it needs, and no child left going hungry.The pair highlighted a report from ITV news, which claims it has seen an email from catering services firm ISS to school staff urging them to ldquotop up on long le, dried, tinned and frozen products to ensure that there will always be some form of food available in a worse case scenario.The broadcaster states the email was sent a week ago.In a statement, ISS said: ldquoOur priority is always the schools, and the children, whose meals we provide.ldquoWe would like to reassure parents and carers that our ability to continue to provide nutritious school meals is not being impacted by the well-publicised shortages of items that the UK is currently experiencing.ldquoNaturally, we have contingency plans in place to ensure that a good supply of meals remains in place. That contingency planning includes regular communication with our stakeholders during these challenging times for many schools across the country.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, said the union for head teachers was ldquoconcerned about the disruption some schools were facing with supply chain issues.ldquoWersquore not hearing widespread disruption from our members but certainly the Government does need to take notice of the inidual cases that are occurring so that the problem doesnrsquot become more widespread, he told the PA news agency.A Government spokesperson said there was ldquono evidence to suggest widespread supply issues and schools have flexibility to substitute productsparticular ingredients are not readily available.They added: ldquoWe routinely consider contingency arrangements and expect schools and catering companies supplying them to do the same.ldquoIn the event of any disruption to supply, we will work with councils and the sector to ensure warm, nutritious meals can continue to be provided.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Instead, wages are stagnant, bills are rising, and the Conservatives are raising taxes on working families and small businesses.ldquoAfter  years of Conservative Government, the only thing on the shelves this week has been yet more jam tomorrow and British business deserves better.Earlier, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi was asked on Sky News whether the Tories are ldquoon a warpath with business.He replied: ldquoI donrsquot agree with you.ldquoWhat I would say to everybody is letrsquos work together.ldquoWe have seen retailers who invested in technology and have done really well. Others like Topshop and Topman didnrsquot make that investment and havenrsquot done so well.ldquoWersquove seen SMEs take advantagepound billion of grants and loans to support SMEs. That is what this Government is doing to help business.ldquoLetrsquos do this together.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4140772.jpg--.jpg?1633611240000\n","title":"children in school bus collision traumatised parent","story":"A parent of youngsters who were travelling on the school bus caught up in a serious traffic collision this morning on the Cullybackey Road says he fears that a number of children will have been traumatised by the incident.

Influenza vaccination is therefore an important priority this coming autumn to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with influenza, and to reduce hospitalisations during a time when the health service may also be managing signicant winter outbreaks of COVID-. Please keep following the public advice to reduce the transmission of flu and COVID-, please get the vaccines and protect yourself, those that matter to you and the health service.”The extension of the community pharmacy role in the   flu vaccination programme will offer an additional route to vaccination for all HSC workers and for all those aged  and over, complimenting existing Occupational Health services and GP services, in order to maximise uptake of the flu vaccine.Chief Pharmaceutical Officer, Mrs Cathy Harrison, said: “Community pharmacists are highly trained healthcare professionals and have continued to play a pivotal role delivering health services to communities in Northern Ireland during the pandemic.“I am delighted to welcome this expanded role for community pharmacy teams, which builds on the success of last year’s community pharmacy flu vaccination service and the COVID- vaccination programme, which has seen over , doses of COVID- vaccine administered in community pharmacies all across Northern Ireland.“This service will complement the already strong arrangements for delivering the flu vaccination programme in Trusts and general practice. And will use the skills of community pharmacy teams to provide much needed additional capacity across the healthcare system to deliver the largest flu vaccination programme ever at the same time as the COVID- booster vaccination programme and maintaining provision of other essential HSC services.”Chief Executive of Community Pharmacy NI, Gerard Greene, said: “Community pharmacies across Northern Ireland welcome the expansion of the Community Pharmacy flu vaccination service, it gives the public the option of getting their flu vaccine at a convenient, accessible location with a local pharmacist they know and trust.

However it does very little to remove the deep seated inequalities that academic selection perpetuates in our society, and could be viewed as smacking of desperation after the debacle of last year.“Our education system needs a root and branch reform, not a further sticking plaster and tinkering around the edges.”The SEAG document revealed the new assessment will consist of two tests comprising English and mathematics items.“The tests will be on separate dates - probably two weeks apart,” the company revealed.“There will be a mixture of multiple choice and free responseitems.”Irish-language versions of the transfer test will also be provided, with parents asked to pay a £ entry fee, though there would be no charge for pupils who qualy for free school meals.In a statement the group of principals behind the plans - the AQE PPTC Implementation Team - revealed the number of schools who had decided to join the new organisation.“We are pleased to announce that  schools have agreed to join the new Schools’ Entrance Assessment Group and we are awaiting final responses from a few other schools,” they said.“Principals of the member schools have been asked to indicate their interest in joining the SEAG Board of Directors and we look forward to the first meeting of member schools in November .“ schools who had previously used AQE tests have agreed to join the new group,  who had used PPTC tests and four who had used both tests to select pupils.“Eighteen of the schools are located in the greater Belfast area the other  are spread right across Northern Ireland,” they said..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDepartment of EducationMore On Department of EducationDemand for integrated education in NI ‘not being met’, says charity as Stormont department criticisedStormont committee told progress made over report on underachievement in education systemSt Ronan’s College Lurgan £m new build plans in chaos and other schools could be hitEx-Economy Minister Diane Dodds says survey focusing on careers advice in schools ‘very worrying’ PremiumRevealed: Nearly , pupils caught Covid after ing in MarchMost ReadTop Northern Ireland hotel sold in £m deal to US investment giantGeorge Best family won’t allow footballer’s name to be used for Belfast hotelEssex lorry deaths: How ancient phone battery nailed Northern Ireland gang responsible for loss of  migrantsArlene’s new job: women’s magazine columnistUUP’s Doug Beattie: Why I wouldn’t have posed with HutchingsTop Videos Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: Man sets himself on fire at City Hall, Belfast WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENTPlaySeven travellers brought Covid to Northern Ireland, says QUB studyLatest EducationDemand for integrated education in NI ‘not being met’, says charity as Stormont department criticisedStormont committee told progress made over report on underachievement in education systemStamp of approval: NI pupil recognised for her tribute to Captain TomPilot scheme to tackle gambling addiction set for NI schools‘My clean slate can make a dference in schools review’LatestFamily’s grief after dad is electrocuted in accident at workCoronavirus NI: Ending social distancing will help hospitality ‘bounce back’Lee Carsley urges England Under-s to learn lesson after surrendering leadIrish Government will be represented at NI centenary church serviceLib Dems and Labour criticise Government after schools face food disruption,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Her department will now determine whether it gets the go ahead.Critics of the plans say the decision is “the only correct option” and the proposal was sought for a large food store on “designated and committed housing land in the Derry Area Plan”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “There were also available alternative sites in designated centres, which were not adequately considered,” Andy Stephens, Matrix Planning, said.“We are in a plan-led system and the decision to grant permission by the planning committee would have created a dangerous and wide-ranging precedent for existing designations zonings to be undermined across the entire Derry Area Plan.“This would have rendered the plan potentially obsolete in future planning decisions at a critical juncture with the new plan some way off. The intervention by the Department for Infrastructure has in my opinion maintained the integrity and confidence in the planning system at a time when public confidence is low.”A spokesman for Lidl Northern Ireland said that “following full approval of our plans and overwhelming local support received for a new £m store in the Waterside area, creating  new jobs, we note with disappointment that this decision is to be revisited”.“Lidl NI remains committed to investing in Crescent Link, in the city of Derry and in the wider north west region.”A spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure, said: “The proposal for a new Lidl store at Crescent Link, Derry has been recently called in by the Department for Infrastructure for its consideration and officials will progress the application to a decision point as soon as is possible.”Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed a “recommendation to refuse a planning application for the erection of a supermarket at  Crescent Link was overturned by elected members of the planning committee in January of this year, who voted in favour of the proposal”.“As per legislation, the application was directed to Department for Infrastructureplanning under notication procedures for them to consider and review. On September , DfI wrote to the council to advise in this case the minister has called this case into the department for decision.

column in Local Women magazine.The former DUP leader, who is also a regular presenter on GB News, will see her first column for the monthly magazine published this Friday.Reflecting on her recent journey, Mrs Foster writes: “The last time you read about me in Local Women Magazine was when I was being interviewed about my role as First Minister.“A week is a long time in politics and all of that, so here I am as your new columnist.“I’m hoping to bring you my take on some of the big stories affecting women not just here in Northern Ireland but across the world, and so much has been happening it’s dficult to know where to start.”Managing editor of the magazine Kim Kelly said the formidable Fermanagh woman was an obvious fit and had always been popular with readers.The decision to go with a column in the local magazine is an indication of the direction Mrs Foster sees her career going when she steps away from politics full time.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s

party leader as MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone when she officially retires from politics later this month.The column also touches on serious global affairs, such as the plight of women in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of US troops earlier this year.“When we think of violence against women in Northern Ireland and how we are committed to stamping it out, we should also think of our fellow women in places like Afghanistan and do all that we can to highlight their plight,” she said.Ms Kelly added: “Arlene is probably one of the best known and most influential women in Northern Ireland and has a lot to say about issues that affect women here and across the world. “I think people will see a warmer and wittier side to Arlene now that she has stepped away from politics, and we

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDevelopment: The site of the George Best Hotel in Belfast city centreAllan PrestonTwitterEmailOctober   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe family of George Best have withdrawn permission for developers to name a Belfast hotel after the Manchester United and Northern Ireland football legend from the east of the city.It follows an announcement in July that local businessmen were working to finish the troubled project which had been hit by financial delays.Work on the George Best Hotel in the historic Scottish Mutual Building at Donegall Square stalled in April  when the owners, Bedford Hotels Ltd, a subsidiary of Liverpool-based Signature Living Hotels Ltd, went bankrupt, leaving investors owed millions.In July, a -strong group of investors announced they would collaborate with Signature Living’s owner, Lawrence Kenwright, to save the development and their investments.However, on Wednesday night, the directors of the George Best company, the late footballer’s family, said they wanted to clary their position, and said that they were not among those investors.“The family terminated all connections with Signature Living earlier this year and in fact are in amongst the creditors currently being handled by the official receiver,” they said in a statement.“Furthermore they have not and will not be committing George’s name to any proposed redevelopment of the site as may have been construed in the article referred to above.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The family added that they “maintain their belief” in the ultimate potential of a hotel “and desire to see a successful scheme completed in the city”.In July, Mr Kenwright said he invited the new group of investors to become part of the George Best Hotel property company, hoping their combined weight would make it easier to get funding to complete the hotel.The group is now chaired by Co Antrim businessman Stephen Kearney, who will now oversee refinancing and development, with Mr Kenwright taking on the role of CEO.After originally investing in the hotel in , he admitted in July that it had been “a turbulent journey” for Signature Living but there was now hope the matter could be resolved with the George Best Hotel administration.The GB Hotel group is also being advised by another Northern Irish businessman, Thomas Scullion, who is himself a Signature Living investor. He is the chair of the UK Accommodation Group , which he set up with fellow investors to restructure Signature Living#s operations last September.Mr Kearney had said that UKAG had “mobilised the vast majority of unsecured investors in supporting Lawrence Kenwright and have worked diligently on a recovery plan”, and said that “crucially Lawrence has handed over control” of operations.Mr Kenwright had admitted he was “ceding controland giving them final say in decisions”. He added: “We have faced a unique set of circumstances in trying to finish the George Best Hotel and I am extremely grateful for this support.”Signature Living did not respond to a request for comment by time of going to press on Wednesday night..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:n When you need the moneyn How long you want it to last for, andn How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing. Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

It started with  pupils in a scout centre.  In this article the Principal of Oakgrove Integrated College, Katrina Crilly, explains why she is so passionate about her school and about its founding principles that, she says, are all about teaching pupils respect for the ersity that’s out there... googletag.cmd.push  As many of you probably know, integrated education here has been around for a long time. This year it’s celebrating its ruby anniversary - it’s  years since Lagan College was established in Belfast. Last week we celebrated this by inviting the Mayor and MP for Foyle to unveil our banner. Surprisingly, despite recent media coverage about the founding of Lagan, it would seem that integration is still largely misunderstood. Here in Northern Ireland  North of Ireland, it’s taken to mean a school where Catholic and Protestant children are educated together. It’s much, much more than that. In today’s global world, we’re confronted with a whole host of ersity: dferent cultures, dferent religions, dferent skin colours. Here at our school, Oakgrove College, we prepare our students to meet and deal with that ersity by providing a learning environment where children and young people from all faiths and none can learn with, about and most importantly from each other. Acceptance and respect for all are key concepts in everything we do. Our desire for every child who joins the Oakgrove family is the promotion of equality, and that must include the forging good relations with everyone in the school and their families regardless of their religious, cultural, social or other background. Integrated education is, at its core, value-driven and child centred. It is delivered through a holistic approach.     Our world, as I have pointed out, is full of ersity that’s the natural law, and so children deserve the opportunity to flourish in that erse environment both at school and in wider society. How  are children supposed to learn about other cultures and backgrounds enough that they understand and accept dference as a natural part of le  We are about preparing children for le and work, providing children with a very real experience of living and working successfully alongside people from dferent backgrounds and beliefs. Many believe that all schools are integrated, but what they actually mean is that they are “mixed”. The two are very dferent. Dferent backgrounds Many schools accept children from dferent faiths and backgrounds and, yes, they are educated alongside each other and under one roof. However, the school does not change its ethos or identity for that child, there is an understanding that the child can attend however the school’s religious ethos remains the same and the child “fits in”. In some respects, the child sacrices their identity to attend the school. In an integrated school, no child has to sacrice their identity to attend, as all backgrounds and faiths, and all our dferences are celebrated and nurtured. At an integrated school no child has to deny his her culture, background or religion. Imagine a place where you can honestly be yourself, where your dference is celebrated as the norm, and where you grow in the knowledge and understanding that we are all equal. This is on top of achieving high academic outcomes and successful career paths. That place doesn’t have to be imagined: it is here – in an integrated school. It is certainly true that all schools provide the NI curriculum and will provide broadly the same extra-curricular activities, but an integrated school will give this and more. Only in an integrated school will children see what is familiar from their background but also learn what is unfamiliar to them, but “the norm” for others in the class. It’s a fact that this is the only place in the world where parents set up their own schools. They did so because of a passionate belief that, after years of conflict, we could only help to solve the communal ides in this society by bringing people together. In September,  Lagan College opened its doors.  years on can we say we are truly the mixed society they wanted us to be  We have, I would suggest, still some road to travel! But the journey is worth the effort. And as Principal of Oakgrove Integrated College, I can say we are committed to making our contribution. Within our school, there is real excitement amongst staff and pupils about learning, and excitement about learning from and with each other. Integrated education brings people together as children, and keeps people together for le.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Mohamad Ali, who runs the Maiden Heaven cafe in Waterloo Place, said his shops logo bears a “a striking resemblance” to the Parachute Regiment’s. On Bloody Sunday, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment were responsible for killing  innocent civilians in the city, another man died from his injuries months later. googletag.cmd.push Since then the Parachute Regiment and its flag has proven to be a contentious issue in the city. Flags can seen displayed in loyalist ares of the city in support of Solider F, who had been charged with the murder of Bloody Sunday victims William McKinney and James Wray. At an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in , the Clyde Valley Flute Band caused controversy when theymarched through the city wearing the insignia with the letter F underneath. The flag has also been burned on bonfires in nationalist ares of the city. Mr Ali said he would never have used the logo, featuring an ice cream cone and wings, had he realised the similarity between it and the insignia the regiment. The shops barriers at its outdoor seated area also features the similar maroon colouring to berets worn by Parachute Regiment soldiers and flags featuring its insignia of an open parachute with wings. In a post on Facebook, owner Mr Ali, apologised for the logo and said that he’s “working to change it”. He said: “It has been brought to my attention over the last few days by few good friends that the logo for Maiden Heaven coffee shop and ice cream bears a striking resemblance to the Parachute Regiment insignia.     “Given the history of this city and the fact that the Parachute Regiment shot dead innocent people on the streets of Derry, I would NEVER have knowingly used a logo that would offend or hurt the people of this city that I love and the city that has been my home over the last  years. I am working now to change this. And sorryanyone was offended by this logo and color, I would never have used it to promote my business had I realised the similarity.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Much thought has gone into creating a safe and socially distanced programme this year, which has meant spreading the activities and installations out over a wider area taking in a number of exciting new locations. “The Translink service will fast track familiesthey have younger children who may not want to cover the full trail, and ensure everyone can enjoy the full experience on offer. I want to extend my thanks to Translink and all our partners for their support in bringing the magic back to the streets of Derry this Halloween.     The shuttle bus service will operate between the NW Transport Hub and Foyle Street, between pm and pm on October  to October , transporting passengers between Waterside and Cityside. The NW Transport Hub will also play a key role in transporting visitors to and from theCity, with visitor numbers expected to be high this year after the cancellation of last years celebration. Tony McDaid, Translink Service Delivery Manager said: Halloween is such an important date in the calendar for this city and were very much looking forward to playing a key role in connecting people and communities once again throughout the event. “We wish everyone a safe and fun Halloween and encourage passengers to remember to wear face masks and use hand sanitiser when travelling.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Donna McLenaghan, who lives in Smiths Falls, Ontario, is hoping to find out more about the family of her great great grandparents who left County Derry for Perth, Canada in the s. googletag.cmd.push Charles McLenaghan and his we Annboth lived in the Dungiven area prior to emigrating.  “My ancestors were originally from Derry, Ireland. They lived around Dungiven before emigrating to Canada,” explained Donna. “The family name is McLenaghan and my great great grandmother who married into the family was an Osbourne and the Osbournes owned an estate called Altmover.” Donna says, according to parish records, the McLenaghans lived in a tract known as Boveva on lands they leased from a family named Carey. They lived there for many generations, which is proved by a lease from Captain Arthur Carey, dated , to Robert McLenaghan of Ballycargan, of the whole townland of Ballycargan Manor of Pellipan for  years. Records also show that many of the McLenaghan clan were schoolmasters and generally were people of superior education. The Osbourne family, whom were also prominent in the district, were originally English, coming from Leeds.  Their estate in County Derry was called Altmover and they were squires and landlords of the neighbourhood. Altmover remained in their possession until the twentieth century, the estate being broken up in .     Ann Osbourne, who was a daughter of the family and heiress to the estate, married Charles McLenaghan. They went on to have a son, named Nathaniel, who married a woman called Jane Morris from County Wexford.  The family then emigrated to Canada. Donna says another of her ancestors, Mary McLenaghanalso emigrated to Canada with their five sons. One of her sons was called Robert Meighan, who married the sister of George Stephen, the first president of Canadian Pacic Railway. She says Robert worked with his brother-in-law to negotiate rail lines between Perth, Ontario and Toronto.  He was also involved in other business and went on to buy a renaissance mansion from his brother-in-law which was called George Stephen House, also referred to as Mount Stephen Club. It has been used by ious Hollywood stars for shooting period films. Donna is now keen to piece together her family tree and hopes to reconnect with others in the area who may have connections to her ancestors. “I decided to trace my family roots out of a very keen desire to find out more about my family roots and possibly connect with relatives that may still be living in the area. “Im also very interested in my great great grandmother Ann Osbournes family as theres mention of it being the same name as the Dukes of Leeds and I wondershe was related to them.” Donna says she hopes to travel to Ireland soon and intends to make a visit to County Derry to visit the area where her ancestors were born. “I havent visited the area although I was hoping to while on a trip to England in  and have had the desire to for many years and hope to do so in the very near future. I feel such a closeness to Ireland as well as the UK since this is the region that my ancestors are from.”  Consultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride  Minister for Infrastructure Nichola Mallon has announced the move.

The window when the sporting acumen of the local community was dissected with a fine tooth comb. The reserves took the field at two oclock in front of one man and a dog. And by the time the game headed for the final furlong, cars would be trickling in the lane for the senior game. Elbows on the wire, the elder statesmen of the club would surmise who the best reserve players were. googletag.cmd.push “Yer man would need to take a look at Johnny,” one might offer. “Hes lording it out there.” There would be a nod back. Sport is all about opinion. With more people filing into the ground, the noise level will go up. Enter the club time-bomb. We all know them. The sort who would argue a black cat white. The man from the opposing club, who was acting as linesman, would have his line ball decision questioned. And all of a sudden chests would be pumped out and a mouthful of choice words exchanged. Often, it sets the tone for the senior game. But the double header gives reserve players an identity. Some will stay togged out for the seniors. Others will get the disco shoes and the hair gel slapped on for the few scoops down the pub later. Some will huff and puff that the senior manager doesnt rate them. A few weeks back, I was in Owenbeg for Newbridges win over Coleraine. Being early, I mixed typing up a few match reports with watching the reserve game. Alan Nash let it flow from end to end, with the senior managers looking on before taking their squad away to prepare for the main event.     There was just that united feel to it all. A group of players who trained on Tuesday and Thursday night, went to the gym together, slagged each other in the same Whats App group during the week, they were all on an even keel. Give or take a man or two, Newbridge have a senior reserve  of  training most nights. Coleraines  sits around the  or  bracket. Its the most theyve had in ages offers Ryan McGeough, their affable two-time championship winning goalkeeper who has now stepped into the role as club Chairman. Mathematically, double headers are not a problem here. But it makes for a juggling act. Newbridge manager Killian Conlan offers the conundrum of how many players to hold off reserve duty. Most clubs are the same. Who am I Iikely to use in the senior game  And its not an exact science. It brings me back to the days of watching Sunday double headers. Being taken off in the reserve game was an elevation in status. “I told ye....Johnnymust be in the senior managers plans,” offers the club stalwart. This is the problem with being the fringe player. Youre caught between two stools. Half a game here, five or ten minutes there. Formation changes, injuries, black cards and poor performance all need to be thought through. The players caught in the middle can miss out on action. The four Newbridge senior subswere held off reserve duty, including Mickey ONeill who came on with minutes to go in a game that was decided while he was on the pitch. His chasing back helped force a turnover on the way to the Bridges winning point In a scenario like Newbridge, moving up the pecking order in the Derry club scene is their mantra. Men caught in the middle just have to ride it out and push like mad for a senior place. Odhran McGlones brief was to put Sean Leo McGoldrick on the back foot, which he did with four points in an all-action  minute performance before his fuel light began to flash and PJ ONeill came in to keep them ticking towards the finish line. The Bridge were the only team guaranteed to finish top of their group before a ball was kicked at the weekend. Would they have got over the line against Coleraine without fresh legs  Thats debatable. The previous night, Sean Cassidy came on in the th minute of Slaughtneils defeat to Lavey. Having played in the reserve game, he was back in action again and fisted over a point within minutes of coming on. Every clubs circumstances are dferent. There are dual clubs, there are suspensions and there is Covid. Its all rosyyou have the numbers. Sideline View conducted a mini poll of club senior  sizes, not counting short-term injuries or any Covid- related unavailability. With the exception of Claudys  of , the other  Division A clubs have a senior  capable to fielding senior and reserve teams on the same day. Of the  responses,  squads had  players or more to fuel a senior and reserve team. A further three were in the middle bracket –  to . At junior and the lower end of intermediate level, the story is totally dferent. The remaining  clubs, were under the  number required to field two teams in one day, without needing to coax a few retired players back to fill out the team to ensure everybody gets football. Concessions dominate the results pages. Of the  intermediate reserve championship group games fixed, only four were played. Four. It has been really sore on clubs who have the numbers. On top of their senior squad of , Steelstown have a reserve  of . With the need to grow GAA in the city, not having a reserve championship game leaves it very dficult to maintain player retention. Why stay when other sports can offer more. Castledawson, Faughanvale, Glenullin and Drumsurn are other intermediate teams who didnt get their full compliment of games. Intermediate champions Greenlough had a recent in-house  versus  game, with nine substitutes. Their reserves have had a in one game in almost nine weeks. In many cases, clubs cannot field a senior and reserve team on the same night. Midweek reserve fixtures at . leave it impossible for some to get home from work on time, taking the numbers even lower again. The reserve and senior double headers of old at the weekend give the best chance toto the status quo. As this column has alluded to in the past, Saturday evening would be a better option. But it doesnt suit everyone. With a fluid situation, there needs to be a look at the future of reserve football and where it fits. Clubs should only enter a teamthey can fulfil their games and allow the CCC to restructure. For example, Desertmartin seniors are playing in the junior ranks, yet have a squad of  and traditionally were always very successful at intermediate reserve championship level. Clubs could be asked for their input into how everything could fit together. Senior managers, with input from their club committees, should look into – and be accommodated by the CCC – moving their reserve game to a dferent night, possibly a training night. One of the management team could take charge of the reserves and everyone  trains. When Ronan Rocks was in charge of Desertmartin, he phoned ahead every week to request a Friday reserve fixture. It was almost always accepted. Stephen Barker, the CCC Chairman at the time, was only too glad to accommodate it and inform the referee of the revised fixture. It takes a bit of give and take between clubs, but overall it would be a step in the right direction. Andone club fails to agree a move, then the fixture remains as it is. The days of two and half three on a Sunday have gone forever in certain quarters. The next step is to make sure the level of conceded reserve games disappears until everyone is playing on a regular basis. That has to be the goal, for the long-term future of clubs.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

The farm allows small groups of people with a learning disability from the Mid Ulster area tolook after deer, pigs, geese, chickens hens, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs and a pony. They spend their day doing food preparation, feeding the animals, animal care and ground maintenance in a safe and enjoyable working environment. googletag.cmd.push Eamon Regan and Ioana ONeil and Dr Oliver and Amanda Shanks Mid Ulster Sanctuary official Opening. The farm is a joint initiative developed between Kilcreggan Homes and the Northern Health and Social Care Trust. Damian Cassidy, Chief Executive Officer of Kilcreggan Homes said: “Kilcreggan Homes are delighted to develop our services in this geographical area of the Northern Health and Social Care Trust, but especially with this specic type of therapeutic farming that we have championed over the past fteen years. We have witnessed the signicant positive impact this model has had on the lives of the service users and their families carers. “I would like to thank Mr Eamon Regan who has had a letime of interest in vulnerable groups for donating thisbeautully manicured site.  The sanctuary is open seven days a week and we are grateful to the local volunteers who provide their time throughout the week. Damian Cassidy and Eamon Regan Mid Ulster Sanctuary official Opening. “Interim findings from research carried out by Dr Laurence Taggart from Ulster University confirm further evidence of the benefits of therapeutic farming and we hope to use his findings in the development and design of future services.”     Jenner Welsh, Chief Executive of the Northern Trust said: “The therapeutic benefits of open space and small animal care, have been highlighted by our psychological services as very positive and important contributors to meeting the needs of those adults with learning dficulties. This new sanctuary offers our service users much needed le-enhancing opportunities through developing communication skills, self-esteem, self-care and helping to build relationships. The new service very much complements the opportunities provided to service users attending Trust adult day centres in the Mid Ulster area. Eamon Regan and Ioana ONeill Mid Ulster Sanctuary official Opening. But this particular model of delivery for day opportunities presents a new and innovative approach that enables community and voluntary sectors to invest in employment opportunities. It offers service users an important alternative to traditional buildings-based day care and supports the integration of service users into the community. This is fundamentally important to improving their quality of le and reducing social inequalities.” One service user who attends Mid Ulster Sanctuary said: “I love all the animals, I like gathering the eggs,I could live on the farm” A family carer said of their son’s placement: “He talks about these jobs that he does in the farm like he’s completed a day’s work. He will tell everybody about this work on a Wednesday for the full week, so to me,I think he does feel a sense of achievement, and he is so happy now.” Kilcreggan Homes is a registered charity that specialises in social housing, day opportunities and social enterprises for adults with learning disabilities, autism and acquired brain injury. In Carrickfergus they have developed a unique urban farm that provides therapeutic farming and horticulture, for these client groups with very positive outcomes for service users.

Rail lobby group, Into The West, say the site,built, will halt rail expansion from DerryReporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Campaign group, Into The West, have warned it will be game over for rail expansion from Derrythe Clanmil housing development on Victoria Street goes ahead. Earlier this year, Clanmil had successfully appealed the decision by Derry City  Strabane District Council not to grant them permission to build on the Victoria Street site. googletag.cmd.push That green-light to Clanmil came to the dismay of Into The West who saw the prospect of the dry rail line on the site being dug up to make way for the planned new flats thereby putting a spanner in the works of the rail lobby groups hopes of having passenger trains run from Derry to the south and west of Ireland. Steven Bradley met with the Councils Governance  Strategic Planning Committee to discuss rail expansion from Derry. Cllr Sean Mooneyraised the following point to him. He said: “There seems to a pressing matter that could prevent any progress on this is the one of Clanmil and the possible development on the Victoria Road.” He proceeded to ask Mr Bradley: “In your view,that goes ahead and is built, is that game over for any future prospects of a rail review. Because when you look at the map, Derry is the end of the rail line when it comes in from Belfast. How  would you address a rail line going from Derry to Donegal or Strabane ”     Mr Bradley replied: “Personally speaking, I suspect it will . “If you start with the principle of a single, central station for the city – the Waterside – andyou accept that you cant cross north of the river over the Craigavon Bridge, because the space and angles arent there, the only way youre going to get rail south to Tyrone and then west to Donegal, is to pass through the Clanmil site. “So the other options involve putting s over the River Foyle, Bearing in mind that rail is heavy, youll be getting into big engineering solutions that are very costly. The economic viability of doing this will be blown out of the water. “Thats why I cant see it being viableClanmil build their structure. “Weve met with Clanmil and had discussions with the DfI . “Everything is in Clanmils court. The have planning permission to build that structure. They could start work on it tomorrow and nothing could be done to strip them unless the will is there to compulsory purchase it – which isnt there from the DfI and I suspect is not there from the Council either. “What were trying to do is to negotiate a solution whereby one of two alternatives happen. Either Clanmil can re-design their building and leave a strip clear between that building and the river so that rail in the future could run along there. “The second alternative were pushing for is for Clanmil to find an alternative site that they could transfer their ambitions onto and wed be very keen for the Council to assist them in that. “Otherwise I cannot see how youre going to get rail going south from Waterside towards Tyrone, Fermanagh and Donegal without going through that Clanmil site.” Clonmil Housing have been approached for comment. Earlier in the meeting, Mr Bradley outlined the inequalities of the current rail network in Northern Ireland by illustrating how everything appears to be geared in favour towards rail stations east of the River Bann.  How the rail network west and south from Derry might look in the future  He said: “We have fty-four railway stations in Northern Ireland of which only three are west of the River Bann. Belfast in greatly rich in rail provision compared to what we have here. “An all-Ireland map of the rail network never fails to shock. Its like someone took a pair of scissors and cut out the railways of a very important corner of the island – the North West. We are lobbying to see that situation changed. “Theres a very clear east-west disparity in terms of rail provisions. We have a six to fix list and so far only one of those has been fixed – the option to buy a ticket online from Derry that will get you to a station in Dublin without having to buy two separate tickets and having to pay extra for that. “It used to be that every station east of Coleraine could do that but we in Derry couldnt. That was fixed in Spring of last year so were grateful for that. “However, were still in the situation whereby Northern Irelands second biggest city – Derry – has only one train that gets people to Belfast before nine am in the morning. “Whether it be for studying or working, there is only one train – leaving at twelve minutes past six in the morning – that will get you in on time. “Coleraine on the other hand, has four trains that get you to Belfast before nine am. Even Portrush, a seaside villagehas two services that do that – one more than Derry. “When you look at peak hours, between four and six pm, theres a half-hourly service that runs from Belfast all the way to Coleraine and then stops there. We in Derry only have hourly services compared to all stations east of Coleraine. “Another fix is the Saturday night service. If you want to go to a concert or an evening out in Belfast, you have to leave before nine o clock at night because the last train that will get you back to Derry on a Saturday evening leaves at ten past nine. “Which means you will have to leave your dinner table or get out of the gig around half past eight in order to catch the train on time. “However,you lived in Coleraine, your last train back from Belfast leaves at twenty to eleven which is plenty of time to fully enjoy at night out in Belfast. “Sundays are a particular bug-bear. There are only six trains on a Sunday between Derry and Belfast – thats one every two hours. If you miss one, youre snookered and have to wait two hours for the next train. “Whereas every other station from Coleraine and eastwards, has a train going to Belfast every hour and has thirteen services in total. “Theres no rationale to have a dferent quality of service on a Sunday because people still need to go and visit people, still need to go to university in Coleraine, Derry or Belfast and people need to catch flights – all things that are done on a Sunday. “Even with the network we currently have, Derry is very much the second-class relation in terms of rail provision.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Fred chose Chupacandra Wizard Bull, bred by Helena Mudrova, as the top female Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Reporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Derry canine judge, Fred Jones flew out to the Czech Republic last week to cast his expert eye in selecting who would be the Worlds top dog. Fred, , who is also a self-employed joiner, has been part of the dog show scene for close to two decades, both in the capacity of showing dogs at competitions as well as judging them. googletag.cmd.push The breed he specialises in are Staffordshire Bull Terriers which he passes judgement over using strict Kennel Club criteria. Last week he was at the World Dog Show in Brno, Czech Republic, where he had to pick a winner from  entrants in the female Staffordshire Bull Terrier category. The one he picked was a Stafford named, Chupacandra Wizard Bull, who is owned by Czech breeder, Helena Mudrova. Fred enjoys his role as a dog judge but said its a long process before you can get to cover World shows as he does. He said: “You become a dog judge through your peers. Basically, you start off showing dogs and eventually, after a few years, somebody will invite you to judge at lower level competitions. “Once you do that, theres Kennel Club exams, seminars and certain criteria you have to meet. Its a progressive thing as it takes many years to work your way up to becoming a championship show judge. “From showing to judging my first ever low-level competition took me about four years. That was in . “In , I judged my first Irish championship. Ive travelled a bit now and Ive been to thirteen countries to judge. The World Show was a very prestigious one to get.     “All dogs are judged on their breed standard as laid down by the Kennel Club which all those showing the dogs have to adhere to. Thats basically covers everything about the dog. “I judged the female Staffordshire Bulls in the World show in Brno which had a total of ninety-nine entrants. “You had dferent classes as well such as Intermediate, Junior class, Open class and winners get a ticket towards an International Beauty title show – of which a dog needs three.” Fred knows what is required for a dog to win a competition having showed dogs himself at the highest level.  Fred Jones with his legendary champion dog, Lackyle Diabhal Og in  He added: “I have showed dogs myself in both Ireland and the UK extensively. There was a dog, named Lackyle Diabhal Og, that I owned that became UK, Irish and International champion. “Hes sadly no longer with us. He was a very famous dog – he produced more champions than any other Stafford in the history of breeding in Ireland.

Fred chose Chupacandra Wizard Bull, bred by Helena Mudrova, as the top female Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Reporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Derry canine judge, Fred Jones flew out to the Czech Republic last week to cast his expert eye in selecting who would be the Worlds top dog. Fred, , who is also a self-employed joiner, has been part of the dog show scene for close to two decades, both in the capacity of showing dogs at competitions as well as judging them. googletag.cmd.push The breed he specialises in are Staffordshire Bull Terriers which he passes judgement over using strict Kennel Club criteria. Last week he was at the World Dog Show in Brno, Czech Republic, where he had to pick a winner from  entrants in the female Staffordshire Bull Terrier category. The one he picked was a Stafford named, Chupacandra Wizard Bull, who is owned by Czech breeder, Helena Mudrova. Fred enjoys his role as a dog judge but said its a long process before you can get to cover World shows as he does. He said: “You become a dog judge through your peers. Basically, you start off showing dogs and eventually, after a few years, somebody will invite you to judge at lower level competitions. “Once you do that, theres Kennel Club exams, seminars and certain criteria you have to meet. Its a progressive thing as it takes many years to work your way up to becoming a championship show judge. “From showing to judging my first ever low-level competition took me about four years. That was in . “In , I judged my first Irish championship. Ive travelled a bit now and Ive been to thirteen countries to judge. The World Show was a very prestigious one to get.     “All dogs are judged on their breed standard as laid down by the Kennel Club which all those showing the dogs have to adhere to. Thats basically covers everything about the dog. “I judged the female Staffordshire Bulls in the World show in Brno which had a total of ninety-nine entrants. “You had dferent classes as well such as Intermediate, Junior class, Open class and winners get a ticket towards an International Beauty title show – of which a dog needs three.” Fred knows what is required for a dog to win a competition having showed dogs himself at the highest level.  Fred Jones with his legendary champion dog, Lackyle Diabhal Og in  He added: “I have showed dogs myself in both Ireland and the UK extensively. There was a dog, named Lackyle Diabhal Og, that I owned that became UK, Irish and International champion. “Hes sadly no longer with us. He was a very famous dog – he produced more champions than any other Stafford in the history of breeding in Ireland. He was also top Terrier stud dog in the UK in . “Two years ago, I showed the grandson of that dog, named Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, which somebody in Scotland owns and he became a champion. He won a Reserve CCat Crufts. “I bought my first Staffordshire bull terrier as a school boy in . I joined my local Staffordshire bull terrier club in  I first became secretary of the club in  held many positions since then including secretary for the second time for the last ten years. “My first judging appointment was in  my first overseas appointment was the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of Queensland Australia in . “I have now judged my breed on twenty eight occasions in twelve countries, nineteen of these were breed club appointed shows and I also awarded CACIBin Italy in .”  Fred with Lackyles grandson, Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, who was one of the winners at Crufts in  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Councillors on Causeway Coast and Glens Leisure and Development Committee approved a date and location for the International Air Show event to be held in . googletag.cmd.push The event is set to take place on the weekend of September  and , with the flight path to be centred between the towns of Portstewart and Portrush. However, Sinn Feacutein raised concerns over an absence of budget projections on a report presented to the Committee, and during an ill-tempered spat among councillors, proposed a further report be brought. Cllr Leanne Peacock Ballymoney Sinn Feacutein councillor Leanne Peacock said the council had shown a dereliction of duty. “Weve got to this stage, agreeing specic details of this project, but were yet to have a single estimate provided to this council for what it will cost us,” she told the council. “As custodians of the public purse, its a complete dereliction of our duty to proceed without a single estimate of what this will cost our rate payers. “We have seen where such reckless decision-making has got us in the past. This council has spent thousands on consultancy fees a year before the event. “Its outrageous that members are not being provided with the most basic detail to make decisions the cost, which is usually the starting point.”     Cllr Peacock proposed a report be brought back to the Leisure and Development Committee with costings included, along with details of affordability checks carried out on the proposal. Council Mayor Richard Holmes pointed out a report with costings was already due to come back to the Committee, before opening the floor to speakers. Council officer Richard Baker said the event was still in the early stages of planning. “What weve done is set the foundation of the event the date and the location. There has been no discussion about the specics through the working group,” he said. “That will be developed and worked through the project board set up for the International Air Show in .” Cllr Aaron Callan has been central to the Air Shows planning. Limavady councillor Aaron Callan expressed his frustration with the Sinn Feacutein response to the event. “From day dot, Sinn Feacutein have opposed the air show in any form. Its not based on finances its based on ideological opposition to the fact that the RAF would be involved,” said the DUP councillor. “These events draw visitors into our area, that support the businesses that pay their rates, and the Air Show is a critical part of that going forward. “If Sinn Feacutein were so concerned about it, they would have appointed someone to the working group, which they refused to do.” Cllr James McCorkell Independent councillor for Limavady, James McCorkell, referred to a comment by Cllr Dermot Nicholl at last months committee about the event being linked to the Queens Platinum Jubilee. “At least Dermot at the meeting said she wasnt his Queen – fair enough. Call a spade a spade. I might not like it, but stop the nonsense, for goodness sake,” he said. “Just say you dont want it. Dont come up with excuses and nonsense about estimates. Weve held this air show for numerous years the estimates are already there,” added the former DUP representative.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication.

Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

When asked for a reason for his stance, Robinson said: “I wouldn’t force people to do it, it’s your choice and your body.” googletag.cmd.push Ireland manager Stephen Kenny has defended his decision to pick the striker to play in Saturdays game saying it would be extremely radical to punish players with international exclusion for refusing to be vaccinated. I think for inidual associations to just come together to decide not to select any player that hasn’t got it would create as many problems,” added Kenny. “They’re problems we don’t need to have.” Joe Duffy opened the conversation on his show Liveline today which seemed to snowball into an argument between pro and anti vaxxers, with some callers slamming Joe for bullying the  year old Robinson. Shocking stuff from @joeliveline beretating Callum Robinson for not taking a covid vaccine. The HSE clearly state the longterm effects information are limited. No one should be hounded in to taking any medication-especially a still on trial one! #liveline — Karen Luby October ,     While others felt that Robinson shouldnt be allowed to play in Saturdays game. If you are not vaccinated you shouldn’t be playing for Ireland, unless you have proper medical reasons. #liveline — Cllr Declan Meenagh ️♿ #StayHomeSaveLives October ,     Commenters on Twitter were also quick to point out that since Callum Robinson has had Covid twice, he would surely have stronger immunity towards the virus. Joe is a dummy .. imagine covering this topic and not knowing that the player is recovered from covid and has more protection now than somebody vaccinated . Luke O Neill should be interviewed on the show to shut up those who don’t follow the science of natural immunity #Liveline          — samryan October ,     The FAI has since released the following statement: The Football Association of Ireland can confirm that all players and staff are tested for COVID- before reporting for international duty with Republic of Ireland teams and are tested repeatedly in camp in line with FAI and UEFA protocols. We have encouraged all our players at all levels of the game to be vaccinated but we respect and must accept the right of all iniduals to make a personal choice on COVID- vaccination. The Association will continue to exercise the highest standards for the safety of all our stakeholders. Our COVID- testing protocols for all players and staff on international duty strictly follow UEFA protocolsand are compliant with all Irish Government guidelines. The FAI reconfirms our support for all Government, UEFA and FIFA protocols during the COVID- pandemic. We thank all our stakeholders for their ongoing exemplary compliance with Government guidelines over the last  months.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

A source close to the country star has said It becomes a big story for Garthhe gets the five nights at Croke Park he was denied before. Three nights won’t be enough. googletag.cmd.push He wants his full five shows at leasthe is ever toto Ireland. Hundreds of residents in the Croke Park area met beside the venue last week with stadium management and Aiken Promotions with concerns over the amount of concerts being planned. Residents are outraged that there could be seven potential concerts held next year and it could go to the High Court, but Dublin City Council could still refuse as they did back in . As it stands under restrictions, only three gigs can take place in Croke Park in a calendar year between January and February. As there has not been a live show in Croke Park since July , Aiken Promotions have been hoping that this would allow them room to negotiate for more gigs in . Garth Brooks May Move Gigs To Aviva If  Croker Nights Falls Through - https:t.co JfNXSWs pic qjsWujjA — Radio Nova  October ,     Pending this decision, insiders say that Brooks is willing to move some of his shows to the Aviva Stadium,hes request for five nights at Croker is denied. “But Garth could do three nights in Croke Park then another three concerts in the Aviva Stadium”,the source continued.     “He could do what Ed Sheeran did in  and add in even more concerts around the regions. This is also causing issues as Sheeran himself has booked two concerts in April . Research has shown that each Brooks gig could possibly generate €million to the local economy. Another study also showed that one concert ticket sold for a Brooks concert would provide € spent in the local area. “They remained steadfast before, and there’s no reason to think they’ll cave in to Garth this time”. “DCC are more into bicycles than heavy lorries so it doesn’t take much imagination to get their view on a fleet of heavy artics rolling in and out of Croke Park for an unprecedented numbers of concerts, added the source. The country singeris already pencilled in to perform in Croke Park for September ,  and  in .Applications have already been lodged to get two extra dates added to this.

This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district. It is time these areas saw the delivery of much needed housing, the councillor insisted.ldquoAs a Sinn Feacutein representative, the delivery of new, affordable,and social homes for those in need is one of my priorities.ldquoHousing is one of the most fundamental human needs.

Further stages of the consultation process with EA are currently underway.ldquoThe school currently has  pupils with capacity in neighbouring catholic maintained schools to support the continued provision for the pupils should the Minister approve the closure.It says St Maryrsquos is operating with five year groups in a single composite class and a further year group in two other classrooms.Over the past five years, the schoolrsquos enrolment numbers have fluctuated between  and .The EA say these statistics show no indication that numbers will increase to  pupils required by Department of Education Sustainable Schools Policy for rural schools.However, while the schoolrsquos governors, staff and parents s were informed of the closure proposal last spring, a statement issued by the school yesterday indicated they opposed the closure.It read: ldquoGovernors and parents have a great confidence in the educational provision that St Maryrsquos provides for our children.ldquoOur most recent ETIreport found education at St Maryrsquos to be of a good standard and our pastoral care has always been outstanding.ldquoSt Maryrsquos is an innovative school with new sensory and nurture rooms. These additional resources enhance the excellent education provision on offer to pupils. ldquoThe school community takes great pride nurturing our pupilsrsquo talents and interests and we will continue to do so. ldquoGovernors and staff are of the view that our school is a vital part of the Saintfield community and we are continuing with efforts to see that it will remain so for future generations.The EA said in its report it investigated other options, such as becoming a shared or integrated education and amalgamation with other schools, but concluded that closure was recommended as there was no evidence ldquoany other option considered could provide sustainable provision.It added: ldquoCCMS recognises the commitment of the governors and staff but the current challenging circumstances do not provide for a sustainable school.ldquoIt is recognised that despite the schoolrsquos best efforts, it continues to face sustainability challenges. CCMS believes that the proposal to discontinue provision at St Maryrsquos PS would not impact signicantly on other schools.It lists other Catholic primary schools in the area mdash St Caolanrsquos in Darragh Cross, St Josephrsquos in Crossgar, and St Patrickrsquos in Ballynahinch mdash as being between less than four to seven miles away from St Maryrsquos and which could take its pupils.The proposal also said closure plans had been put back for a year due to the Covid- pandemic.The SDLP councillor for the area, Cllr Terry Andrews, said he shared the concerns of parents and staff.ldquoSt Maryrsquos has provided first-class education to the community for many, many years and the staff are to be commended for their dedication to generations of families who have sent their children there, he said.ldquoI would encourage all local people to take part in the consultation to the EA and make them aware of their strong feelings to the proposal..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Business owners urged to engage over town future  ","story":"THE Downpatrick business community has been urged to play a full part in the consultation exercise on the continued economic regeneration of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is spearheading the initiative and local councillor Dermot Curran appealing to businesses to get involved.While a number of politicians are in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, local authority officials are not keen. However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address. Revitalising the town centre is crucial.Cllr Curran mdash who is in favour of appointing a town centre manager mdash believes that Downpatrick should also have a vibrant body to represent tradersrsquo interests, one that could play a key role in helping attract investment and new business to the area.He said as one of the provincersquos county towns, it is disappointing that traders do not have a dedicated body to not only represent them, but articulate their views.ldquoAs we move out of lockdown and look forward to a post-Covid world, businesses will have an increasingly important role to play, suggested Cllr Curran.ldquoPutting the needs of the business community front and centre is essential and attracting additional footfall has the potential to benefit a signicant number of traders. Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others.

Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final. He had a personal tally of -, all of which were scores of the highest quality.Drumaness and Down have a real star of the future in their ranks.

I see the tourists who visit Hard Yard every day and they remind me just how special it is. I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage. His mother is vice-principal at St Patrickrsquos.Cormac hopes to major in Government and graduate in , but has taken the opportunity to get involved in other activities such as being admitted to the John F Kennedy Junior Forum.Cormac was one of  people accepted out of  applications.ldquoItrsquos really competitive to get into to so I threw my hat into the ring not expecting to get it so I was completely blown away when I did. he said.ldquoThe group organises heads of states, politicians and leaders in business to visit campus where we moderate discussions and debates with them and a student audience.ldquoWhile Irsquom on the digital marketing team helping to promote the events, I could also find myself on stage later this year with Nancy Pelosi, the serving Speaker of the House of Representatives, which is completely mind-blowing.Cormac has suggested inviting Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission mdash a sign of his continuing interest in all things European.He met President Joe Biden when he was  after an opportunistic letter to him turned out to be beneficial.ldquoI was a massive Biden fan long before he ran for President and Irsquom still very proud that I predicted his presidency four years ago. I wrote a letter at  and saidI would like to meet himhe was ever in Ireland. My parents and I got the chance to meet him in Dublin the day after the Brexit vote.ldquoIrsquom more likely to ask him nowhersquos going over to Ireland, would he give me a lt on Air Force One, he joked.Cormac is still not behind the door connecting with famous people with his red hair helping him engage with TV host and producer mdash and fellow redhead mdash Conan OrsquoBrien when the former Hard student gave an address to new students.ldquoThe rest of the guys suggested we get a picture together as we look alike but he was great fun. The best thing was that I was wearing my Red High GAA shirt, said Cormac.While he has taken Hard and the US to his heart, Cormac retains his real love for his home.ldquoIrsquove really loved the adventure of having to adapt to the American culture and my three best friends here are all Americans.

The alternative is to face the unfortunate consequences of their actions which I donrsquot think is something anyone would want to see.Cllr Trainor said ongoing anti-social behaviour has not only impacted on the coronavirus testing centre, but work to provide a new walking track around the perimeter of the town centre park.ldquoThe recent spate of anti-social behaviour threatens to damage the positive work which has been accomplished in the area over recent times and this must not be allowed to happen.ldquoThis has been such a dficult year for everyone and we continue to emerge from Covid, more resilient and ready to see more delivered in our local communities for the better. Part of this includes the new walking path.Cllr Trainor said the work to provide the new path is ongoing with people already taking an interest in it.He added: ldquoI appeal to those responsible for a series of incidents at Dunleath Park to stop what they are doing and realise the consequences of their actions. The testing centre in particular is a key asset in the ongoing fight against coronavirus.ldquoThe excellent frontline staff who work there deserve to be allowed to get on with the job free from threats of any kind.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table. He had entered London Marathon for spring in a bid to cut his previous time of . set there in . Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances. She had to pull out in the middle of the Lecale Ultra last month due to injury but she sensibly rested enough to get back on her feet and Kevin carried on his mission with his usual understated approach.Come race day they ran well literally taking it in their stride. They finished in the same time of . which is a personal best for Clare by three minutes and four minutes for Kevin. A job well done.Jim Erskine has done a few marathons in his time, having completed his first way back in , but this time he entered at the request of his daughter, Ellen, who was making her debut.The duo followed the training schedule together keeping each other motivated in the long runs. They lined up knowing that Ellen would have the upper hand in both youth and speed but she was glad that her dad was there to keep her pacing on track. His experience paid off in spades.When they parted company at  miles, Ellen had enough reserves to finish strongly and Jim knew that he would complete at his own pace. Ellen posted a time of . ndash commendable to break four hours on her first attempt.Jim finished in . just as delighted with Ellenrsquos performance as his own.Marathons are not always about going as quickly as you can. For some, simply getting to the end is a great result as it proves that you have the determination to achieve your goal.Sam Anderson has come on literally leaps and bounds in her running. She has been a keen attender at training and while she would admit that she is not a leader in terms of pace, she is a great inspiration to others.She went under the radar and took on the Great Manchester Run recently. She didnrsquot spread the word as this was all part of her plan to do the marathon without making a drama out of her intentions.While this was not her first time doing a full marathon, it was in her words ldquothe first in a long time.She took to the roads with the masses and then set her own rhythm. She had to dig deep as the miles went on and was very grateful to meet up with a friend who then encouraged her for the latter half.Her time was immaterial mdash crossing the line, and knowing that she had done what she set out to do, was her sweet reward. A big congratulations to her for this.Not every runner on Sunday in Belfast was out to do the full route. A popular addition to the marathon is the relay event.Rachel Madine, Martin Willcox, Mark OrsquoConnor with the addition of Wayne and Daniel Giles made up a team with each of them doing a section of ying .Patrick Smith was involved in a team raising money for the Anthony Nolan Trust. They all enjoyed being part of the bigger picture and I suspect some of them might be thinking that a full marathon could be on the cards in the future. It is an addictive pastime.Janine Murray had won an entry into London Marathon at the EDAC draw in December . When her name was pulled out of the hat, she was concerned as to whether she would be ready in time. Little did she know how long she would have to train.She did complete two virtual marathons close to home but finally  months later she arrived in London for the live event.London has all the glamour and the pizzazz with , runners strung along the spectator lined course.The iconic landmarks that form the back are a sight to behold and those who have ran this marathon see it as a bucket list event.Janine had been training hard and set off with the goal of breaking four hours  minutes but also to enjoy the atmosphere to the full.She was buzzing with excitement at the finish from the run alone but when she saw her time of ., she was over the moon. She was a great representative of the club and made full use of the opportunity.Phillip Vint has completed the London Marathon many times and yet he would still say that each time is special.This year it was all the more so with the enforced layoff from competition due to restrictions. He was very content with his finish timeand also delighted that he was able to complete his th marathon in such spectacular surroundings.We as a club are based in Downpatrick but we have some members who live in other parts of the world and we love to keep in touch with them.Hannah Somanitook part in London. She ran an impeccably paced race with splits barely wavering beyond a couple of seconds per mile.This metronomic performance earned her a . finish, well within her . aim and placed th out of the female finishers. Super work, Hannah.Deo Kato works and lives in London so there was no way he was going to miss out.This was not his first marathon but it was his first in London and even though he sees the sights on a daily basis, he was blown away by the experience of running on the closed roads of the city and the support of the cheering crowds. He hopes that this will be something that he repeats next year.Wendy Findlay set off to the remote location of Loch Ness for her marathon. She loved the pipers and the Baxterrsquos soup at the finish but the monster hill at mile  wasnrsquot so welcome.She described the route as undulating but scenic and the weather, as you would expect in Autumn in the highlands, as fresh but damp.The marshals were friendly, reaching the start was easy and all in all she had a great day out. She finished in . after reaching half way in . setting a negative split in her enthusiasm to reach the finish.She mentioned that her husband Johntook part in the Festival of Running laid on for the supporters and said that this would be another reason to recommend the event to anyone considering an entry in the future.With all the talk of mileage, we mustnrsquot forget that challenges come in many dferent forms.Neil McCartan is highly unlikely to do a marathon as for him speed is king. He sticks to the track with m his preferred event with races up to K the norm. After leading out the EDAC team at the Road Relay Champs in style, he ed to Victoria Park in Belfast for the weekly parkrun.These events are not races but timed runs open to anyone who registers. Neil was taking part as a training exercise in his group coached by Mark Kirk.He lead the pack in with a super slick . for the k which was reported later as being the third quickest parkrun time recorded at any of the weekend parkruns throughout the UK.We donrsquot normally report on parkrun as it is impossible to keep on top of all the activity, but this one is worth a mention. Well done for putting EDAC on the map.We are always open to new senior members and have acquired quite a few recently who are glad that they have taken the plunge.We are an all rounder club with members chasing speed, distance and the challenges but we also have a main body who come to training to keep fit and enjoy the good company.If you are interested, please email Donal at membership@eastdownac for details..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie.jpg","title":"Francie builds boat with recycled material  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK man is realising his dream of building a river boat by using recycled materials such as wood pallets and aluminium.Instead of costing around pound, for a new boat of the same size and specication, Francie Morgan aims to finish his ft boat on a budget of pound,.The  year-old intends to launch the four-berth boat from Carrybridge in Upper Lough Erne in Co Fermanagh next May, with the help and support of his family and many friends.But before that, he would love to enter it as a float in next yearrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick.While the main structure is complete, Francie will be working over the winter and spring to fit out the inside.The father-of-seven began to build the boat last year during lockdown and scoured scrape-yards and recycled materials yards to get items which either cost him a fraction of their original price or where the owners were only too happy to get rid of them.ldquoTherersquos men who are only too happy to see me coming to take away some pallets. It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

and the Newcastle  group, were revealed last year.The plan consists of three stages mdash from the Downs Road car park to Castle Bridge, between the Newcastle Centre and Pattons Bridge and the third

about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative

open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible

A number of children have to cross the road on their way to school and it is essential that it is safe to do so, he continued.ldquoA pelican crossing can help achieve that and I hope that the roads minister will look favourably upon my request. This is a critically important issue that must be addressed.Cllr Curran said it is his understanding that the recent incident involving a child at the Downpatrick Road ldquocould have been quite serious and hopes that action will be taken to prevent any kind of repeat.He said pupils who attend the busy primary range in age from  to  and in addition to his request to Mrs Mallon, he would be keen to meet meet with roads officials on site.ldquoIt is a very serious situation when drivers are not obeying the speed limit, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoA new pelican crossing would require drivers to come to a complete stop to allow children to cross safely..Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe recent incident involving a child has reinforced the need for a dedicated road crossing and I hope that the Department for Infrastructure will respond positively to my request.

Supporters of both clubs were robbed of the pulsating midfield clash witnessed in the league meetings between these sides of Brea McKee versus Aimee Greene.St Johnrsquos star McKee has been instrumental for the Black and Whites this year, but Emily Stewart and Cara McEvoy still ensured a fine tussle in the middle sector against Greene and Lauren McGivern.The St Kevinrsquos full back line of Casement, Noade and Ferris had to be alert to the quick passes being drilled towards Aoe Stewart, Catherine McKey and Dervla McNeill.Maria Gilchristrsquosmeant that once turn-overs were made, play could be swtly transitioned directly into Rhona Gordon, Laura Carville and Kate Fitzsimons.Goalkeeper Orlagh Rice was impressive for the away side. The former Poacutec Fhaacuteda runner up, has the strongest re-starts in Division , and she launched numerous attacks, drilling accurately into the paths of Catherine McKay, Leanne Kelly and Claire Marie McCann.Her one delivery that went astray, was collected by Gordon in the th minute, who superbly struck over the bar from the tightest of angles.Jenny Greene had a good battle throughout with Cara Doyle, as did young Anna McVarnock with Niamh McEvoy.McVarnock played a superb crossfield ball into the path of Ryan, just before half time, who finished emphatically to the net, giving the Kevinrsquos a healthy eleven point lead at the break with a half time score of - to -.The second half provided further evidence of the intelligent structured game that Kevinrsquos are increasingly playing.Better combination and link-up play, especially between defence and attack, is leading to improved performance levels. The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13080159.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There has also been over , new cases in the last two weeks.Previous mathmatical modelling led by Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesfrom Imperial College London, has been highly influential in shaping the UK’s response to the pandemic - with this Queen’s research set to do the same. The study also estimates that it takes an average of . days for an exposed person to develop symptoms and become infectious to others, meaning that a symptomatic patient could spread the disease for nine days.Dr Gabor Kiss explains: “The modelling suggests that the outbreak could have entered the country undetected as it took some time for people to become infectious and develop symptoms.”“This research provides in depth data on how exactly COVID- spread in Northern Ireland and this will help to develop public health-driven strategies, not just in NI, but across the globe.”Dr Kiss added: “It lays the foundation for a decision-making support tool which could assess the state of an outbreak and help to advise on optimal interventions in the early phases of any re-emerging high consequence infectious diseases which are vaccine-preventable.”The experts also looked in detail at the first lockdown and found that the number of infectious people decreased rapdily after coronavirus restrictions were introduced by Government, such as social distancing and wearing masks. The expert team at Queen’s is now working on incorporating other aspects of the outbreak into their models, such as the geographical journey of the disease in Northern Ireland. This will give further information on the impact of localised lockdowns throughout the pandemic.The research was published in the Open Journal of Modelling and Simulation, find it here https:www.scirp.org journal paperinformation.aspx paperid"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/13079645.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The pair highlighted a report from ITV news, which claims it has seen an email from catering services firm ISS to school staff urging them to ldquotop up on long le, dried, tinned and frozen products to ensure that there will always be some form of food available in a worse case scenario.The broadcaster states the email was sent a week ago.In a statement, ISS said: ldquoOur priority is always the schools, and the children, whose meals we provide.ldquoWe would like to reassure parents and carers that our ability to continue to provide nutritious school meals is not being impacted by the well-publicised shortages of items that the UK is currently experiencing.ldquoNaturally, we have contingency plans in place to ensure that a good supply of meals remains in place. That contingency planning includes regular communication with our stakeholders during these challenging times for many schools across the country.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, said the union for head teachers was ldquoconcerned about the disruption some schools were facing with supply chain issues.ldquoWersquore not hearing widespread disruption from our members but certainly the Government does need to take notice of the inidual cases that are occurring so that the problem doesnrsquot become more widespread, he told the PA news agency.A Government spokesperson said there was ldquono evidence to suggest widespread supply issues and schools have flexibility to substitute productsparticular ingredients are not readily available.They added: ldquoWe routinely consider contingency arrangements and expect schools and catering companies supplying them to do the same.ldquoIn the event of any disruption to supply, we will work with councils and the sector to ensure warm, nutritious meals can continue to be provided..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Lib Dems and Labour criticise Government after schools face food disruption article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Instead, wages are stagnant, bills are rising, and the Conservatives are raising taxes on working families and small businesses.     ldquoAfter  years of Conservative Government, the only thing on the shelves this week has been yet more jam tomorrow and British business deserves better.Earlier, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi was asked on Sky News whether the Tories are ldquoon a warpath with business.He replied: ldquoI donrsquot agree with you.ldquoWhat I would say to everybody is letrsquos work together.ldquoWe have seen retailers who invested in technology and have done really well. Others like Topshop and Topman didnrsquot make that investment and havenrsquot done so well.ldquoWersquove seen SMEs take advantagepound billion of grants and loans to support SMEs.

There can also be pus and some may have the condition for weeks or even months.What are chilblains and how does this dfer from Covid toes Chilblains are small, itchy, red patches that can appear after you have been in the cold.Chilblains usually appear a few hours after you have been in the cold and you mostly get them on your fingers and toes, but can also get them on your face and legs.They usually clear up on their own in two to three weeks, but you may need to see a GPthey do not go away.What causes Covid toes A new study - published in the British Journal of Dermatology - has found that Covid toes could be a side effect of the immune systemrsquos response to coronavirusResearchers behind the study examined  participants with Covid toes and  with similar chilblains lesions that arose before the pandemic.The study found that one mechanism behind both types of the condition involved the body generating an immune response with high levels of certain autoantibodies, which mistakenly target and react with a personrsquos own cells and tissues as well as the invading virus.     Researchers also found an overlap with type I interferon, which is a key protein in the antiviral response.Cells lining blood vessels which supply the affected areas also appeared to play a critical role in the development of Covid toes and chilblains.Senior author of the study, Dr Charles Cassius, said the research provided a deeper understanding of the condition.He said: ldquoThe epidemiology and clinical features of chilblain-like lesions have been extensively studied and published, however, little is known about the pathophysiology involved.ldquoOur study provides new insights. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “Adam has proven himself as an outstanding local representative since being elected to Fermanagh and Omagh District Council. He’s shown real passion to improve the lives of people in his local community and across the council area. “As a science teacher he understands the reform that’s needed in our education system. He also recognises the dire need for immediate action to tackle the climate crisis to safeguard this place for future generations. “Adam is part of an ambitious SDLP team in Fermanagh and South Tyrone delivering for local people. People want to see action to address waiting lists for housing and healthcare, but they won’t get it from the status quo. We need people to choose change and vote for candidates like Adam Gannon to build a better future for everyone across the North. Mr Gannon said: “It has been a real honour to represent my local community as a councillor over the past few years and I’m delighted to have been endorsed by the SDLP as our candidate for Fermanagh and South Tyrone in the Assembly election. Since being elected I have worked to help people on a wide range of issues, both big and small, and would love the opportunity to bring the voice of local people into the Assembly chamber. “I’ve lived in this area all my le and am proud to call it home. Unfortunately, local people have been badly let down by their politicians in recent years. We have seen businesses close, the decimation of our town centres and the abandonment of our rural communities. We deserve so much better than this. “The SDLP has a strategy to transform the North and I want to be part of it. The politics of ision may suit the DUP and Sinn Feacutein but it has delivered nothing for people here. We need real action to ensure that everyone can get the medical treatment they need without having to wait years for it, that everyone has a home that meets their needs, a radical overhaul of our crumbling education system and a real commitment to tackling the climate crisis. We can’t afford to do nothing, people have had enough and it’s time for change.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_effbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbefaacddcacbfded   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1633620547856.jpg--covid_19___thu_7th_october_figures.jpg?163362054800","title":"covid  thu th october figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
