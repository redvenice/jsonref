For a boxer who has not fought in 23 months, it’s obvious Khan’s appeal stretches far beyond the ring.His popularity is swelled by a electric and combative nature, and the ongoing interest around his personal life. It’s an inevitable outcome of wanting to remain relevant and an extension of becoming famous. Stop making news in your work? Well your private life will do the business.Khan steps into the ring against Canadian Phil Lo Greco in Liverpool this weekend. The outing will end a near two-year exile from fighting. It’s not harsh to say Khan likes the limelight. He performs well there, and for the most part of his boxing career, Khan has thrived under the weight of expectation.But it cannot be underestimated how difficult it is to make the switch from celebrity to fighter, even if Khan did once occupy both spaces simultaneously. One man who found out the hard way about this tricky transition was David Haye.The heavyweight returned to boxing after three years of really enjoying retirement. He had two glitzy fights and then came unstuck against the seasoned Tony Bellew.Not only was Haye’s focus, training and strategy warped, but his body cracked under the pressure of a return to fighting. He wore the wrong kind of boots, his fitness was not up to scratch and his Achilles snapped. Granted, Haye was 36 when he fought Bellew, Khan is only 31, but he should treat what happened to his fellow Brit as a warning.His focus slipped and his body gave up on him (Picture: Getty)Bellew felt he could exploit Haye’s inactivity and he did just that. Lo Greco believes he can do the same against Khan.Khan doesn’t drink, but he’s no stranger to partying. By his own admission he has trained only intermittedly since his last fight. Lo Greco puts great stock in that fact and believes Khan has proven himself to be ‘mentally weak’ after two troubled years away from boxing.‘It all started for jokes and giggles, but he bit,’ Greco said. ‘He definitely doesn’t have thick skin, and now we’re here.Khan was subdued at the final press conference (Picture: Mercury Press)‘What happened was, I have a TV show called the ‘Culinary Fighter’. I tagged him in one of my episodes because I called him a ‘Khandashian’‘I tagged him and he blocked me. I didn’t think much of it. I’m like whatever, he took it personally, and then when he announced the fight, I called my producer and said hey man, do me a favour, knock up some photos, let’s just have some fun. But I didn’t think he was going to bite.As any world champion will tell you, performing consistently at an elite level requires an unbreakable mentality and focus. Khan was competing in I’m A Celebrity as recently as December. The stint in the jungle can be seen as a wonderful PR move to remind the paying public of Khan’s personality, but can also be viewed as another distraction.Khan believes the time off has helped his body heal and re-group from a life of boxing. It’s a good argument, but his body could have also slowed down, softened, without the stresses of training camps and fights. Problems with his right hand prolonged Khan’s absence, as he took more time than expected to recover from the surgery.Khan’s last fight was a knockout loss to Canelo Alvarez (Picture: Getty)For a fighter who relies so heavily on his speed and reflexes, it seems a massive risk to take for a reward that may not materialise.There’s also the question of whether the chilling knockout at the hands of Canelo Alvarez will linger on Khan’s body and mind. Khan was always open to be hit and Alvarez wasn’t the first man to put him straight to sleep. But it will also not be the first time Khan has had to come back from a painful stoppage.Khan’s doubters will question his mental state and his chin, but the fighter has rejected the idea he is returning for anything other than for himself.‘I’ve done a lot in the game, I’ve made a lot of money, I’ve made a big name for myself, I’ve fought in America,’ Khan said.‘I just want to achieve a ­little bit more in the game. If I win another world title I can say: ‘Thank you very much, I’ve had a great time, a great career.’I’m 31, look at Manny Pacquiao, who is 39 and started having his big fights at 31. Look at Floyd Mayweather, he is 41 years old and still fighting. I’m still a baby.Mentally, it’s been a turbulent two years out of the ring. Khan fell out with his parents, then reconciled. There was significant strain on his marriage, and it all played out in the press and on Khan’s social media.Physically, Khan has taken time to recover, and will have to face the consequences of that risk.There have been changes in Khan’s team. He was forced to take on a new trainer after his long-term coach Virgil Hunter fell ill in March. The Experienced Joe Goossen has stepped in to guide Khan, but there’s no telling how that late set-back could affect his confidence.(Picture: AFP)Matchroom boss Eddie Hearn now holds the promotional strings. Khan will be hoping the British promoting powerhouse will be able to get him the biggest fights and the opponents he wants.But the biggest test for Khan is himself. Lo Greco is a fighter he should dispatch with ease. But Khan needs to prove he’s rediscovered his focus and it may take time to produce his best form.The journey back to a world title may be longer and tougher than Khan thinks. It all starts with the Bolton-native successfully switching his mindset.

What can you talk about to ensure that there are no awkward, staring-at-the-menu silences? And most importantly, how can you impress her enough to get a second date?It can feel like a complete gamble. But don’t panic – here are some stressbusting tips to help you make sure everything goes smoothly.We know, you want to be romantic and original. You don’t want to take her to a boring bar or restaurant, so you’re thinking of a mid-day picnic in the park. Perhaps a hike to a place you’ve never been before? Ice-cream on a rollercoaster?The whole point of first dates is that you’re getting to know a stranger – you have absolutely no idea what they like. At this point, you don’t want to suggest a quirky, offbeat date that they might not enjoy (besides, ants crawling all over the two of you on a blistering July day in the park is not exactly conducive to romance).No, no, there’s a reason the classics are classics.Take her to a restaurant and just talk. Order your signature drink, ask her if she wants to split a starter. Once you know her likes and dislikes better, you’re free to plan inventive dates.First dates can feel like a job interview, in the sense that you’re both trying to see if you’re a good match. You want to skillfully highlight your time spent doing charity work in Uruguay, your extensive knowledge of Russian literature, or your piano-playing ability.But that doesn’t exactly put people in the mood for romance. Take off your interview hat and relax, so you can put her at ease.Instead of talking, listen. Ask her simple questions: ‘What’s a typical weekend like for you? Ah, do you enjoy that? That must be difficult – tell me more?’Good listeners are rare enough to be impressive.Above all else, she wants to feel that you take an interest in her, and that she’s an interesting person. If you spend the entirety of the date lecturing her on all the wonderful things about yourself, she’s going to go home bored out of her skull – no matter how varied your CV is or how funny you try to be.Sure, that’s not how you’ve seen it on TV and movies. Onscreen, first dates are filled with sexy innuendo and knock-em-dead lines. But this can easily backfire, or come off cheesy, or (worst of all) leave her feeling uncomfortable – the kind of uncomfortable where she calls for the bill and texts her friends saying: ‘Oh god, complete disaster. He was being creepy and overtly sexual the entire night.’When in doubt, keep it subtle. Maybe lay off that filthy joke you heard around the office last Friday. Don’t go straight to the pick-up line you read in some men’s Internet forum.Do compliment her: ‘You look beautiful in that dress.’ A tasteful compliment does the heavy lifting –it lets her know that you’re attracted to her, without being OTT. Remember, you can always flirt outrageously later when you know more about her preferences.It’s natural to be curious about the other person’s relationship history, or their current status. You want to swap horror stories of online dating, or talk about dealbreakers. You might both be thinking: ‘Heshe is so great, why are they single?’All of that is fine. With one notable exception: Do not talk at length about your exes. There’s just no reason to do it on the first date, no matter what. Even if you thought they were ‘crazy’ because they keyed your car.Don’t talk about why you broke up with them, or do a post-mortem of that relationship. Don’t point out that your ex’s favourite band is playing in the bar. Don’t talk about them, period. This is a date between two people, not a therapy session with the ghost of your ex in attendance.A pop-up sex shop in New York is encouraging women to ‘think with your vagina’Keep the ex references to zero – and if that’s tough, question why. If you can’t go on a date without bringing up Jenny who you loved four years ago…maybe you shouldn’t be dating.Okay, let’s skip ahead to the final five minutes of the evening. You’ve split the check after she refused to let you pay, you’re walking her to her car, and you feel so tense you can’t move. What do you do? Do you kiss her? Do you say goodbye? Do you do the stiff one-arm hug before disappearing?Relax. Watch her cues. If you’ve been flirting heavily for hours, it might be the propitious moment to lean in slightly and say ‘I’ve been thinking about kissing you the whole night.’Whatever you do, don’t lunge – it’s hugely offputting.If a kiss happens organically, fantastic. If not, don’t stress it. Handle any rejection with grace. It might not be the right time. Maybe it’ll happen on the second date, when you finally go on that picnic in the park.This is your chance to be polite and sweet. Tell her that you had a lovely time, and ask her to text you when she gets home safe. That way, she’s much more likely to say ‘Yes please’ when you text ‘Can we do this again?’MORE: How to avoid unintentionally being a d*ck to women in the street at nightMORE: How to compliment a woman without being a creepMORE: A guide to birdnesting, the hot new orce trend"},{"url":"http://metro.co.uk/author/ellen-scott/\" class=\"author url fn\" rel=\"author\"\u003eEllen Scott\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"post-date\" itemprop=\"datePublished\"\u003eThursday 19 Apr 2018 1:53 pm\u003c/span\u003e\u003cmeta itemprop=\"dateModified\" content=\"2018-04-19T14:36:20+0100","title":"can guys feel difference different vaginas just penis","story":"(Picture: Ella Byworth for usCome on, you know you’ve wondered.Do different vaginas actually feel that different?Does my vagina have a particular sensation completely unique to someone else’s?Could someone be capable of feeling the difference with their penis alone?Or are all vaginas generally the same cosy, cushioned, tunnels, indistinct from one another?It’s something we’ve pondered. And apparently we’re not alone in this eternal questioning, as someone’s started a thread all about it on Reddit, titled: ‘Do different vaginas feel different to guys during penetrative sex?’We took it upon ourselves to ask some people with penises for answers. Their names have been changed, because shockingly few people want to publicly compare people’s vaginas. Fair enough.First off, what does sex feel like when you have a penis? The general consensus is a warm, wet, cosy grip of the penis. That’s what we’re working with.Adam, 26, tells Metro.co.uk that yes, there are noticeable differences between different vaginas purely in terms of penetrative sensation.‘Some feel harder, some wetter, some deeper, some tighter, squishier, funner,’ he explains. ‘Some just feel better… comfier and easier to work with.’Tom, also 26, agrees. ‘Naturally there are differences – tightness, wetness – although I suppose the second isn’t necessarily a physical difference in vaginas,’ he muses.(Picture: Ella Byworth for usWetness makes sense as a noticeable difference. People’s vaginas will vary in terms of wetness depending on their arousal level as well as their vagina’s natural lubrication levels, and the wetter someone is, the easier penetration will be – that’s something that’s noticeable based purely on penile sensation.But within someone’s personal wetness, there are different levels of lubrication. One day they may feel wetter than another, so it’s not a particularly distinguishable trait.The same goes for warmth, which Brian, 33, says he notices as a variable. Vaginas change in temperature, and the penis can feel that, but one person’s temperature on one day doesn’t make their vagina unique to another’s.‘Some are warmer than others,’ says David, 33. ‘Some get cold when they cum.’It’s worth noting that some differences will only be noticed through digital (with your fingers) penetration, but not through the penis.‘Bumpiness is not something you notice with your penis,’ Brian tells us. ‘But you do with fingers.’Our fingers are sensitive and we use them to feel things out and pick up information. We aren’t trained to do the same kind of textural learning with the penis (in evolutionary terms, we just want to penetrate to the best of our ability to reproduce), so it makes sense that someone may not feel the intricacies of a vagina’s curves and bumps with their penis alone.So while vaginas may each be different in terms of texture and curves, it’s likely that those differences wouldn’t be picked up by penetration with the penis.(Picture: Ella Byworth for usPenis sensitivity declines with age, lessening from age 25 onwards, and one person’s penis may be more sensitive than another’s, so there’s no blanket answer for what exactly someone’s penis feels when they’re tucked up in the vagina.But as Tobias Kohler, assistant professor of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, notes, men rarely complain about their decline in sensitivity. This suggests that either sensitivity to the vagina’s textures isn’t that big of a factor in men’s sexual satisfaction, or the changes in sensitivity aren’t noticeable – possibly because the penis wasn’t that sensitive to texture and curves to begin with.If you’ve ever had a guy think he’s penetrating you when he’s in fact nestling his penis between your thighs, or had him do accidental anal, you’ll probably agree that the penis isn’t that great at figuring out what it’s encountering.The differences the penis is able to pick up, however, are warmth, wetness, and grip.‘Tightness is a massive variable and one of the only things that isn’t changed by a condom,’ says Brian.Think about it in terms of other bits of your body – if you wedge your arm into something, you might not be able to tell what it is as well as you’d be able to with the tips of your fingers, but if it tightened around your arm, you’d feel that. Feel free to test that by grabbing your arm right now, as we’ve been doing for the last hour or so.Tightness is something varies between women, but can also change over time or on different occasions. A more relaxed vagina will feel looser, so there’s not one defined grip that one vagina can deliver, although some people will have vaginas that are naturally more narrow or wider set.Body type does play a role in how the vagina will feel, although it may not be noticeable through penetration.Carl, 26, tells Metro.co.uk: ‘Some are more bony – like, hard. It’s skinny girls, actually. It’s more pleasurable with girls who are above a size ten.’(Picture: Ella Byworth for usThe biggest differences in sensation aren’t down to the uniqueness of one person’s vagina, but more so the overall experience of sex. That’s what guys will be noticing during penetration – how good the sex feels, not the vagina’s measurements and floorplan.Warmth, lubrication, and grip, all affect the general experience of sex – but these are all things that can vary not just from person to person, but moment to moment.Of all the guys we asked, none of them felt confident that they’d be able to pick out a previous partner’s vagina based on a blindfolded line-up of penis penetration. So while different vaginas may feel different, the differences aren’t stark enough to help distinguish one person’s vagina from another.It’s more so the other stuff that’s going on that would help a man tell different women apart – the movements, the warmth, the general enjoyment – not the exact way the vagina feels in terms of texture and shape‘I’m not so sure I could,’ says Tom when posed the vagina line-up scenario. ‘Obviously there’s the staple sensation of just dick in vagina, but it’s everything else that’s with it that obviously causes that specific sensation as well.‘If you were to just give me some real life replica of my girlfriend’s pussy or something and I had to f*** it blind folded it’s not gonna feel like f***ing her.’That’s because – not to get mushy – sexual pleasure and sensation isn’t about the physical structure of someone’s vagina. It’s about how you use said vagina, and all the other stuff going on as part of sex.A pop-up sex shop in New York is encouraging women to ‘think with your vagina’And none of the men said they’d had experience with an unpleasant-feeling vagina, so even if they can feel those subtle differences, it’s really not a big deal.Tom explains that he’s had sex with someone who had a ‘bad’ vagina – ‘but that might be more to just not feeling it with that person, rather than their vagina, or me being too drunk ’cause you know the IPAs don’t cooperate with my pecker.’So in short: Yes, sex feels different with different people. That makes sense.But the textural details of your vagina don’t make you distinguishable in a line-up assessed only by penetration. The things a penis feels are warmth, wetness, and grip – all of which can vary day to day.No matter what they feel though, the men we spoke to agree that vaginas on the whole are very good. So you don’t need to panic that your vagina doesn’t feel as amazing as someone else’s, or wish your vagina fit some model ideal.Now we’ve got that sorted, we can stop pondering these big questions and focus on just enjoying sex.

Fact.\u0027 Meghan’s half-sister appears to be left off the guest list along with her brother Thomas Markle Jr, his ex-wife Tracy and their children Thomas and Tyler Dooley. Today Meghan met youth delegates taking part in this week’s high-profile Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) in London. It is unusual for someone who has not yet married into the royal family to be involved in a high-profile occasion such as the Chogm summit.But the Queen, who is Head of the Commonwealth, has made clear she sees Harry and his future bride as lynchpins of her work with the so-called ‘family of nations’. Miss Markle, 36, who has given up her acting career to devote herself to being a full-time royal, has no previous links to the Commonwealth, but has worked with the UN as a women’s advocate for Political Participation and Leadership and undertaken several humanitarian missions.     Ms Grant initially expressed excitement at the prospect of being invited the the Royal wedding          Ms Grant called the decision to not invite members of the extended family the \u0027elephant in the room\u0027          She claimed that no-one had been invited to the Royal wedding so far from the Markle familyMs Grant has also confirmed she is writing a book about her half-sister.In the past, she claimed to have raised Meghan for 12 years when she was growing up in California.But other sources speculate that the pair had little to do with one another.The Palace announced last Wednesday that world leaders and politicians would not be included on the list of those attending the wedding.US President Donald Trump, UK Prime Minister Theresa May and the Obamas have not been invited to the wedding.But they invited an extra 1,200 members of the public to the castle for the celebrations as reward for their community work. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/14/4B47DBFA00000578-0-image-a-108_1524059151952.jpg","title":"Presenter Fern Britton pays touching tribute mother Ruth","story":"    Fern with her mother Ruth in an image she uploaded to Twitter after she died aged 94          She also posted this picture and a touching tribute to her mother describing her as \u0027funny and ferocious\u0027It\u0027s healthy for children to see their parents row, says...Share this articleShe added: \u0027So brave and uncomplaining.

He’d wanted to tell her story not just as a shark attack survivor or amputee but as an indomitable athlete whose surfing, attitude and routine were practically unrivalled – and Bethany’s fortitude through her unexpected pregnancy, and afterwards, completely fit with the ‘unstoppable’ theme.She gave birth to her first son, Tobias, on June 1, 2015 – and she was back on her board a few short weeks later, preparing for yet another competition. (Her second son, Wesley Phillip, was born just last month.)‘What really impresses me, and it still does to this day, is just her work ethic,’ Lieber tells DailyMail.com. ‘I’m eating a burger, I’m winding down she’s going to bed with Tobias and doing an ab workout in bed – not that I’ve seen her do it, but her husband Adam is like, “Dude, she’s doing abs in the morning, at night…” She just has this ability to go, “I am going to push through the pain and get this done.”’He points to an incident from a surfing trip to Bali with Bethany that illustrates that perseverance.‘She popped her rib out she was having trouble breathing, in a lot of pain,’ Lieber says. ‘She didn’t tell me ‘til the trip was over! Two weeks later, she was like, “Oh, yeah, I popped my rib out, I was in a lot of pain, but I didn’t want to complain.”’He adds: ‘Her work ethic, you kind of see it, but then once you get to work with her, you’re like, “Oh wow – you are on another level.”’Battered boyfriend Alex Skeel tells of his mental tortureMoment teenagers dice with death during heatwave in DevonShocking moment man shoves Met Police officer off moving motorbikeDramatic chatter between Southwest flight 1380 pilot and ATCDavid Copperfield in civil injury trail questioned about guest safetyGreat white shark circles father and his sons before BITING boatJewish man is whipped with a belt in anti-Semitic attack in BerlinCCTV captured moment truck thief hit by car as he steals bikeHilarious moment woman freaks out during Shard VR experienceQueen hosts lunch for Commonwealth leaders at Buckingham Palace    Hamilton, hospitalized after a shark attacked her and bit off her left arm while she was surfing in Hawaii, was determined to continue excelling at the sport she lovedPhoto courtesy of Noah Hamilton Photography          Hamilton competes in the Outerknown Fiji Women\u0027s Pro surfing competition in Fiji in May 2017 fellow pro surfer Tyler Wright says in the film: ‘How she’s been able to adapt and be the powerhouse that she is is absolutely incredible\u0027          Hamilton is pictured with filmmaker Lieber, who tells DailyMail.com: \u0027She could’ve chosen to live a quiet and simple life, but she has this passion for surfing, and so she works at it … My idea was to tell her story in an authentic way, and I hoped that would resonate with people and inspire them, whatever they’re struggling with in their life’          Hamilton married her husband Adam, who worked in youth ministry, in 2013 she found out she was pregnant the following year and admits in the film that she initially found the news difficult, though she had always hoped to one day be a parent          Hamilton continued to surf and even compete while pregnant she says in the film that her surfing \u0027got smoother I got better at surfing while I was pregnant\u0027The making of the film was ‘kind of this three-year process of seeing her ability against the best female surfers in the world, and seeing that there was something there beyond this idea of, yeah, she survived a shark attack. Cool,’ says Lieber, referring to when a 14-foot tiger shark bit off Hamilton’s arm in October 2003.‘But really she’s one of the best female surfers in the world – and that’s what sparked my interest, like, wow, this could be something really special,’ the filmmaker tells DailyMail.com.‘I saw all these goals that she had for her life and all these dreams and, you know, it can be challenging when people in the world tend to try to put you in this box of this or that … my goal was to capture her and document her and tell her story that is authentic to who she is.‘We’re not trying to put a twist on this or that being with her for four years and getting to know her so well really allowed me the ability to tell her story from her perspective – and obviously mine as well – but really trying to get in there and bring all that to the surface. And she works so hard.‘A lot of her peers are competing month in and month out on the world tour, so you have that peer-to-peer competition – whereas she’s doing it off on her own. To get as good as she’s gotten by herself is a feat in and of itself, regardless of limb loss or not. To work that hard is just an incredible thing to watch and really inspiring for me.’The film traces Bethany’s surf dreams from childhood, which she spent on Hawaii with her siblings and parents, all avid surfers, as her mom and dad worked multiple jobs to support the family. Her mother delivered magazines, Bethany explains in the film, enabling her to tag along on trips and surf different spots all over the island. The documentary features interviews with her family, friends, peers and others – and includes not only intimate scenes filmed by Lieber but old footage from family home videos.In one clip, filmed before Bethany lost her arm, her mother Cheri chats with Bethany and her best friend.‘Are you concerned about sharks at all? How do you deal with it?’ Cheri asks.‘Just pray,’ says a young Bethany.Her strong Christian faith sustained her after the loss of her arm she says she knew six days after the attack that she wanted to get back on her board – and she was also inspired by another surfer, Mike Coots, who continued surfing after losing his leg in a shark attack.  Hamilton is pictured before the shark attack, left, after which she wrote the book Soul Surfer, which was a New York Times bestseller later turned into a movie starring Helen Hunt, Dennis Quaid and AnnaSophia Robb          Hamilton, who became an inspirational figure around the globe following the attack and her triumphant return to surfing, has credited her strong Christian faith with helping her through the experience  Hamilton and her husband - who director Lieber calls \u0027a solid, calm, smart and supportive person\u0027 - discuss their relationship in the film she says ‘I couldn’t be where I am today without the way that he’s supported me’Family footage included in the documentary shows Hamilton and Coots chatting while she’s still in the hospital he assures the young surfer that he’s tried paddling with one arm, and it can be done – and the 13-year-old looks completely confident that she’ll get the hang of it. Sure enough, she was soon surfing again – and winning.Unstoppable follows Hamilton as she surfs some of the world’s toughest waves and Lieber, well known for his surf cinematography, worked hard to get the best shots – whether he was underwater with a go-pro or mounting a camera on her board.‘For people who don’t surf, it’s interesting and informative,’ says Lieber – adding that Hamilton’s success story translates far beyond the world of competitive surfing.‘I think we’re in a really unique space right now with everything happening politically in our country, with the women’s movement and all these different things,’ he says. ‘I think the film could speak volumes to so many, and I hope it does.‘I hope, in a world where everything seems to be a little negative spin right now, hopefully this is a little shine of positivity.’He says: ‘I really want this to impact the next generation of women coming up.’Incredible photos reveal the moment a father-of-two is...\u0027Any time, something can happen to one of us\u0027: Pro surfers...\u0027You went out surfing!\u0027 Simon Baker is scolded by reporter...Share this articleHe applauds Hamilton’s honesty and openness in the film, which showcases many intimate moments in her life – not least her struggle to accept her pregnancy.‘It’s been really fun watching her and Adam become parents,’ Lieber says. ‘That is a quantum shift from just thinking about yourself and what you want to achieve. Before she met Adam – you see I tin the film – it was very draining to go out into the world by herself and always having to be the rock in tough situations emotionally. So when Adam and her came together, Adam was (and is to this day) such a solid, calm, smart and supportive person.‘Them coming together, I saw Bethany blossom in a whole new way. That was so fun to watch and obviously to document.’     Hamilton and her husband, a former youth minister, are also very candid about their relationship in the film.‘Being a guy, I want to provide,’ says Adam, who is originally from Kansas and worked in youth ministry before traveling the world with Bethany. ‘I want to be depended on, because that’s how I grew up. That’s how everyone I knew grew up. It was definitely, like, challenging. I started out thinking, okay, for this few years or something I’m going to support Bethany and things are going to like phase out and then I’ll get a job.’She, however, says: ‘I think it would just be really hard on us to be separated so much, if he was busy with our own endeavors.’‘There’s definitely a balance that we’re trying to find,’ he says – with his wife conceding: ‘I couldn’t be where I am today without the way that he’s supported me.’           Hamilton shared details on social media of her workout regime throughout her second pregnancy, adding that she surfed up until she was about six and a half months pregnant           Hamilton\u0027s grueling workout regime is chronicled in Unstoppable, with everyone from interview subjects to the director himself marveling at her nonstop commitment to fitness          Lieber shares how Hamilton\u0027s husband told him that the surfer would often retire to bed at night with her son Tobias and still do abs workouts          Hamilton shares her love of fitness and a healthy lifestyle with fans and hopes to inspire people around the world          Lieber, who is renowned for his surf cinematography, went to great lengths to achieve the best shots for the documentary, whether it be using a Gopro underwater or mounting cameras to boards          Hamilton’s friend and fellow Hawaiian pro surfer Carissa Moore says: ‘The craziest thing for me is seeing her here in Fiji as a mom and multitasking between heats – holding Tobias, making it all happen and keeping things organized and focused – which is so cool for all the girls on tour, especially me. ‘I was like, I’m going to way til my career’s over and then have kids it’s really cool to see, hey, you can do both’          Bethany \u0027popped out a rib\u0027 while filming but didn\u0027t tell Lieber for more than a week he says \u0027She just has this ability to go, “I am going to push through the pain and get this done”’          Director Lieber says: ‘I think we’re in a really unique space right now with everything happening politically in our country, with the women’s movement and all these different things ... I think the film could speak volumes to so many, and I hope it does. ‘I hope, in a world where everything seems to be a little negative spin right now, hopefully this is a little shine of positivity.’And her friends and competitors, interviewed in the film, marvel at the level of her skill – and her unstoppable drive.‘How she’s been able to adapt and be the powerhouse that she is is absolutely incredible,’ pro surfer Tyler Wright says. ‘I don’t know how she does it.’Hamilton’s friend and fellow Hawaiian pro surfer Carissa Moore says: ‘The craziest thing for me is seeing her here in Fiji as a mom and multitasking between heats – holding Tobias, making it all happen and keeping things organized and focused – which is so cool for all the girls on tour, especially me.‘I was like, I’m going to way til my career’s over and then have kids it’s really cool to see, hey, you can do both.’And the point of the documentary is exactly that, Lieber says – showing viewers, and especially young women, what can be achieved through determination and perseverance.‘My idea is that people can be unstoppable in their own lives, and it’s a choice,’ he tells DailyMail.com. ‘She could’ve chosen to, like she says in the film, she could’ve chosen to live a quiet and simple life, but she has this passion for surfing, and so she works at it … there’s all these messages that are kind of layered in there.‘The idea of, just be unstoppable … you could apply that to your health: “Okay, I’m going to really buckle down and be healthy” or you could apply that to mental illness. There’s so many different things for everybody. My idea was to tell her story in an authentic way, and I hoped that would resonate with people and inspire them, whatever they’re struggling with in their life.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/15/4B4B023400000578-5631837-image-m-170_1524146966308.jpg","title":"TV giant Dale Winton remembered","story":"Dale Winton used his final TV interview in June 2016 to admit he couldn\u0027t find love because \u0027nobody wants a camp, over 60-year-old\u0027 like him          The star (pictured in the studio) also revealed he couldn\u0027t use internet dating because he feared he would look \u0027desperate\u0027 and \u0027deeply unattractive\u0027 to other gay menBattered boyfriend Alex Skeel tells of his mental tortureMoment teenagers dice with death during heatwave in DevonShocking moment man shoves Met Police officer off moving motorbikeDramatic chatter between Southwest flight 1380 pilot and ATCDavid Copperfield in civil injury trail questioned about guest safetyGreat white shark circles father and his sons before BITING boatJewish man is whipped with a belt in anti-Semitic attack in BerlinCCTV captured moment truck thief hit by car as he steals bikeHilarious moment woman freaks out during Shard VR experienceQueen hosts lunch for Commonwealth leaders at Buckingham PalaceBattered boyfriend Alex Skeel tells of his mental tortureMoment teenagers dice with death during heatwave in DevonShocking moment man shoves Met Police officer off moving motorbikeDramatic chatter between Southwest flight 1380 pilot and ATCDavid Copperfield in civil injury trail questioned about guest safetyGreat white shark circles father and his sons before BITING boatJewish man is whipped with a belt in anti-Semitic attack in BerlinCCTV captured moment truck thief hit by car as he steals bikeHilarious moment woman freaks out during Shard VR experienceQueen hosts lunch for Commonwealth leaders at Buckingham Palace    Dale died at this £1million home in Whetstone in north London just three weeks after moving there from his central London flat.

Please make sure everyone turns up\u0027.He added: \u0027Deep down he was a bit lonely. He needed a partner. He has had some bad picks\u0027. In the 2016 Loose Women interview Dale  admitted he was too depressed to leave the house after a messy break-up with another man but never revealed publicly who he was dating.He said: \u0027It (depression) was triggered by a very bad break-up. God, I can\u0027t half pick them\u0027.\u0027People are amazed at my taste.

I pray he has found peace\u0027 and Dale\u0027s cousin Madeleine Trehearne, 65, told MailOnline: \u0027We feel that he died far too young and we\u0027re really cut up about it.\u0027 Dale started his career in local radio and had little work for eight years until he spent nearly a decade hosting Supermarket Sweep before fronting the National Lottery show In It To Win It on BBC1 for 14 years and the Pick of the Pops show on BBC Radio 2 for ten years.But the star, known for his sunny disposition, bright smile and tan, disappeared from public life two years ago admitting he \u0027wouldn\u0027t leave the house\u0027 because of depression and regrets that he had failed to admit he was gay until he was 45.A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders. But this year he relaunched his career with a US travel show on Channel 5 called Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive.  The final episodes will now be shown at an \u0027appropriate time in the future\u0027.          This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive (pictured) but he died before the series was shown in full   TV star Dale Winton has died at the age of 62 at his London home (pictured in his last public appearance in July 2016 with friend David Walliams), and right a month later          Flowers for the \u0027kindest man I know\u0027 were left on his doorstep today by a friend nicknamed \u0027GoGo\u0027 by the starDale had moved to a five bedroom semi detached home in Whetstone worth around £1million and his silver Range Rover with a personalised number plate is still on the drive. Next door neighbour Evelyn Sawers, 68, said: \u0027Dale had only been living there about a month. \u0027He kept to himself, occasionally I\u0027d see him on his door step and he\u0027d say \u0027hello\u0027 but other than that I didn\u0027t see much of him.           Dale\u0027s big break came with Supermarket Sweep, which saw contestants racing around a supermarket collecting items. He hosted the show from 1993 to 2001, and was involved in a 2007 reboot\u0027Yesterday there were four ambulances and a lot of police and I wondered what had happened. \u0027There was a tall blonde woman by his front door talking to a policeman. She might have been a relative. \u0027It wasn\u0027t until I saw the news that I realised Dale had died. It\u0027s a shame as he seemed a nice man. I recognised him from the television\u0027. Former neighbours of Winton in Central London have paid their tributes to the TV star.\u0027I saw him a few weeks ago,\u0027 said a woman who lives on York Terrace East and declined to be identified.\u0027He was delightful, always very kind, but he hadn\u0027t been the same since Cilla (Black) died. Since then, he spent a lot more time in Florida.\u0027A man who lives opposite Winton\u0027s former residence said: \u0027He was a very nice man. Very agreeable and cheerful. He always gave me a big hello on the street. He was very neighbourly.\u0027A bouquet of white roses lay on the doorstep of Winton\u0027s old house with a card that said: \u0027The kindest man I knew. Always in my heart.\u0027 It was signed \u0027Go Go\u0027. Last night Winton\u0027s agent confirmed his death at home at the age of 62, but no further details about how or why were given. In a moving tribute to his friend David Walliams tweeted today: \u0027Dale was the best company, always outrageous \u0026amp hilarious. He adored being in show business \u0026amp loved meeting fans. He devoted his life to making everyone else happy, his friends, the public \u0026amp his godsons, even though he found it hard to be happy himself.

Although Copperfield (left in court yesterday) said it might be his fault if an audience volunteer who was participating in an illusion got hurt, the celebrated magician didn\u0027t acknowledge responsibility for injuries Gavin Cox (right) claims to have suffered when he fell          Gavin Cox  is claiming lasting brain and body injuries and more than $400,000 in medical expenses.

He explained that the site where the accident happened, about 22 feet before reaching the door to re-enter the casino, is essentially level with only a 1-degree dropCox, from Kent, claims lasting brain and body injuries and more than $400,000 in medical expenses. He claims to have suffered injuries to his brain, neck and shoulders.He and his wife, Minh-Hahn Cox, are seeking unspecified damages in their lawsuit, which also names as defendants the MGM Grand, show producer Backstage Employment and Referral, and construction firm Team Construction Management.Cox, who was at the show as the highlight of a dream trip to celebrate his 53rd birthday, claims negligence led to his fall.On Tuesday, the magician\u0027s friend and executive producer, Chris Kenner declined to say it was dangerous to lead people along a dark and unknown route over changing floor surfaces of linoleum, cement, carpet, sidewalk and tile. The illusion had been performed thousands of times over the last two decades, with about 55,000 taking part in the last ten years alone and none of them having had a problem, Kenner said.Earlier in the case, MGM Grand\u0027s attorney Jerry Popovich told the jury that Cox simply missed a step when he fell and did not slip. He explained that the site where the accident happened, about 22 feet before reaching the door to re-enter the casino, is essentially level with only a 1-degree drop. Popovich said that 10 minutes before Cox went down, Copperfield had walked through that same area as part of another illusion that did not involve audience participation. He said Copperfield would have notified staff if he had noticed any problem in the route.    Gavin Cox (pictured) was overcome with emotion as opening statements were made in the case. He claims that on returning to Britain after taking part in the trick, he suffered chronic pain while a scan showed a lesion on his brain.He said Copperfield\u0027s assistants hurried him down a secret passage, through a door and outside into the open air. He said: \u0027It was like a fire alarm went off. They were saying Hurry! Run, run, run!\u0027It was total pandemonium. You don’t know where you are going. It’s dark. There are hands pushing you on your back. As I went around a corner, my feet slipped from underneath me and I hit the ground.\u0027Mr Cox says he fell as he ran around the side of the theater.In the interview, he said that he as now forced to wear an oxygen \u0027lung\u0027 at night because he stops breathing, and he spent three months in a Californian brain trauma centre. The couple claimed they had been forced to live in the US for years as the case dragged on.Mrs Cox said in 2016: \u0027We are too broke to go out and Gavin’s injuries prevent us from enjoying a normal life. Gavin once cooked for royalty but now he can’t even bake a muffin because he has nerve damage in his hands and no sense of smell.\u0027 Mr Cox said he blacked out after his fall but remembers the audience cheering at the end of the trick. An ambulance later took Mr Cox to hospital where his right shoulder was found to be dislocated.Two days later he filled out an accident report at MGM and hired a US personal injury lawyer.  Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost pretrial bids to close proceedings to the public to avoid disclosing performance secrets, although Judge Mark Denton has said some portions of Copperfield\u0027s testimony might still be conducted behind closed doors Once back in Britain, Mr Cox said he began to suffer chronic pain, headaches and confusion. A scan would later show lesions on his brain. But Mrs Cox said NHS waiting lists were ‘too long and he needed immediate treatment’.So the couple returned to Vegas in February 2014. Their travel insurer refused to pay for ongoing treatment, but they were seen under a \u0027medical lien\u0027 – doctors agreed to treat Mr Cox and receive payment only when the lawsuit is settled.Mr Cox\u0027s career had once included years as a chef at London’s Buck’s Club, where he cooked for the Queen Mother, Margaret Thatcher and Dracula actor Christopher Lee, and running a guesthouse in Broadstairs, Kent. But he said in the interview that he has been unable to work since the accident.Having had multiple operations on his back and neck, he said he had been diagnosed with permanent brain damage and a form of Parkinson’s. The Coxes were forced to sell their guesthouse for £515,000 at the end of 2014 and had been living off their savings. At the time of the interview, the Mail On Sunday quoted Copperfield’s lawyers as saying they denied all allegations but could not comment further due to ongoing litigation.They added: ‘This illusion has been performed for more than 15 years and with more than 100,000 participants.

Kilham, with help from his sister Phoebe and his wife Debbie, takes in orphaned bear cubs until they\u0027re old enough to fend for themselves  Kilham takes in orphaned bear cubs until they are old enough to fend for themselves  A black bear roams the property of wildlife biologist Ben Kilham in Lyme, New HampshireIn addition he observes adult bears in the wild, including Squirty, who is now 22 years old and has had 11 litters.His dedication to black bears -- the most common in North America with a population of around 750,000 -- has made him such an expert that China asked for his help with the giant panda, a collaboration that inspired the recently released documentary \u0027Pandas.\u0027After a quarter of a century of study, Kilham has no doubt that bears are as close to humans as great apes, even if as he says, apes \u0027were our closest genetic relative.\u0027He quickly realized that female bears were capable, like humans, of \u0027reciprocal altruism\u0027 -- or in other words looking after each other for the greater good.Squirty provided early proof of that. Shortly after releasing her into the wild, Kilham says another wild female false-charged him in a bid to protect Squirty, despite never having seen her before.          After a quarter of a century of study, Kilham has no doubt that bears are as close to humans as great apes, even if as he says, apes \u0027were our closest genetic relative\u0027- \u0027Reciprocal altruism\u0027 -\u0027I was like \u0027Wow, what\u0027s going on?\u0027\u0027 the 65-year-old recalls.\u0027She is unrelated! That\u0027s pure altruism!\u0027 he explains. \u0027She is taking a huge risk, encountering a human which is her greatest foe, to defend unrelated cubs from me.\u0027Since then, Squirty has shared her resources with this wild female, and shows more aggression toward her own family members than she does from this unrelated female, he says.These are parallels that many scientists are still reluctant to draw, convinced that man is more capable than animal.\u0027We are learning more and more,\u0027 says Kilham. \u0027Language is probably the one thing that has brought humans where we are.\u0027Screaming gran picks up her granddaughter and flees inside...Papa bear! Virginia State Trooper rescues two orphaned bear...Share this articleBut if language has allowed humans to develop to such an extent, Kilham also believes it has corrupted their behavior.\u0027Squirty takes in real information,\u0027 he says. Bears \u0027learn first-hand information and experience,\u0027 he says.\u0027Whereas humans, we are all over the place. The quality of information as soon as the word came out became disruptive. There is air in almost everything we read. It is especially prevalent today with the internet and fake news.\u0027Kilham says he is fascinated by the impact of language on human behavior, especially since he discovered -- at age 40 -- that he was dyslexic.- Revenge of a dyslexic -  Wildlife biologist Kilham has released 165 bears back into the wild over the past 25 yearsDyslexia lay at the heart of his difficulties at school and, for a long time prevented him from pursuing graduate studies in wildlife that he had dreamt of since childhood.He grew up surrounded by animals collected by his virologist father. He studied birds and for a while the family even kept a baby crocodile, brought back from a year in Uganda, in a shower in the basement.After working as a gunsmith, Kilham\u0027s dream took off when the department of fish and game -- tipped off to his interest by a biologist friend -- entrusted him with the first bear cubs, opening the way to the first bear rehab center in New Hampshire.Twenty-five years later, Kilham has released 165 bears back into the wild and documented more than 1,500 bear interactions in nature.His work led recently to a PhD in environmental sciences, not bad for someone not great at school, whose work has been looked down on by the scientific community.He has enjoyed quite the following nonetheless, thanks to articles in National Geographic and the popularity of his book, \u0027Among the Bears,\u0027 which came out in 2002.His commitment is to raising awareness about bears, still feared and hunted in the United States. Around 10-15 percent of New Hampshire\u0027s 5,000 to 6,000 bears are killed every year in hunting season.\u0027Bears are not interested in people. Zero,\u0027 he says. \u0027They are afraid of us.\u0027Despite advice to the contrary everywhere, people still leave food out or fail to secure chicken coops, attracting an animal that needs to fatten up before hibernation and again in early spring. In human-bear situations, the bear is always the loser.\u0027We can live very easily with bears, it\u0027s a matter of educating the public,\u0027 says Kilham. \u0027Unfortunately educating the public is like herding cats. They don\u0027t take in information very well.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/12/4B48D54A00000578-5633307-image-a-16_1524137758623.jpg","title":"NONE passengers pictured Southwest flight 1380 wearing oxygen masks correctly","story":"    Incorrect: Aviation experts have pointed out that the Soutwhest Flight 1308 passengers pictured in this image are not wearing their oxygen masks correctly.

Listen to your flight attendants! ALMOST EVERYONE in this photo from Southwest Airtoday is wearing their mask WRONG. Put down the phone, stop with the selfies.. and LISTEN. **Cover your NOSE \u0026amp MOUTH.**\u0027 Aviation experts say the masks are essential in ensuring passenger safety during aircraft emergencies.The Federal Aviation Administration calls the masks \u0027the first line of defense against the potentially lethal effects of hypoxia and carbon monoxide poisoning.\u0027 Hypoxia occurs when a person isn\u0027t getting enough oxygen, which can cause dizziness, reduced vision, impaired judgment, unconsciousness and even death. Aircraft manufacturer Airbus say if a plane loses pressure at 40,000 feet, those on board have as little as 18 seconds of \u0027useful consciousness\u0027 without supplemental oxygen.According to flight attendants, at this point the masks should drop from the cabinets overhead and they can then be activated by tugging them towards you.Passengers then need to strap the masks over both their nose and mouth before fastening the white cords behind their heads. In the picture, at least three passengers can be seen pressing the masks to their own faces and only covering their mouths.Mr. Laurie\u0027s post has now been liked and re-tweeted over 20,000 times, as several others voiced their concerns over the passengers\u0027 actions. Jennifer Riordan, 43, a mother of two, was killed on the Southwest Airlines flight from New York to Dallas on Tuesday morning - the first fatal incident in US commercial aviation for nearly a decade. The Boeing 737-700 took off without incident but minutes into the flight, passengers heard an explosion in the left engine, which sent shrapnel flying through the window, shattering the glass and leading oxygen masks to drop.     Terrifying images shot from on board show the carcass of the ruined aircraft engine which malfunctioned mid-airJennifer  was nearly drawn out of the window which was next to her seat and had to be pulled back into her seat by other passengers.After the plane made a rushed emergency landing - she was taken to hospital for emergency treatment but later died.Seven other passengers were also treated for injuries, although it is unclear as yet whether any were suffering the effects of hypoxia or carbon monoxide poisoning. Marty Martinez, 29, began filming in selfie mode in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Martinez, who runs a Dallas marketing agency, said on Wednesday he wanted to communicate with loved ones, but many social media users attacked him in expletive-laced postings. The hero captain of the plane insists she was just doing her job after safely performing an emergency landing amid the crisis unfolding on board.Tammie Jo Shults showed \u0027nerves of steel\u0027 and kept calm even as she told air traffic officials that a passenger, Jennifer Riordan, had almost been sucked out of the depressurized cabin of the Dallas-bound Boeing 737.But in a statement a day after the mid-air drama, the 56-year-old and First Officer Darren Ellisor said: \u0027We all feel we were simply doing our jobs\u0027.\u0027On behalf of the entire Crew, we appreciate the outpouring of support from the public and our coworkers as we all reflect on one family\u0027s profound loss,\u0027 the two pilots said, adding that their \u0027hearts are heavy\u0027.It comes as it emerged that Shults was once turned down by the Air Force and had even been warned at a high school careers fair that \u0027there were no professional women pilots\u0027. Instead, Mrs Shults was commissioned into the Navy in 1985 and reached the rank of lieutenant commander, said Commander Ron Flanders, the spokesman for Naval Air Forces in San Diego.Women aviators were excluded from combat missions until the month after Mrs Shults got off active duty in March 1993, but Mr Flanders said Mrs Shults flew during Operation Desert Storm trainings as an aggressor enemy pilot.           Jennifer Riordan, 43, was the only person killed on the flight after a piece of shrapnel punctured the window next to her          Tragic images show where Ms Riordan was nearly sucked out of the open window and had to be pulled back in by passengers          A piece of the engine casing discovered by startled residents at the Heidelberg Country Club in Bernville, PA, approximately 60 miles from the landing site          Officials from the FBI have been called in to help investigate the cause of the incident and could be seen helping wrap up the evidenceSouthwest Airlines passenger, 29, trolled for LIVE STREAMING emergency landing | Daily Mail Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/03/4B4C072000000578-0-image-m-26_1524104630415.jpg","title":"Bovis Homes accused misleading buyers deliberately delaying repairs shoddy homes","story":"    Nearly 3,000 people have joined the \u0027Bovis Homes Victims Group\u0027 on Facebook, complaining of a long list of problems with their homes.

She also claimed her driveway was sinking. In addition she suggested the invasion of slugs, worms, beetles and spiders was a result of them having their \u0027own personal entrance\u0027 into her home.A statement issued by Bovis apologised that Ms Stacey-Pope \u0027did not get the quality she deserved\u0027. They promised the repairs would be dealt with and her property brought up to standard.

Earlier this week Mr Evans met the Pope to plead for more help to save his brain damaged son\u0027And the difficulty here is if the chance of any long term improvement is virtually nil then by actually putting Alfie at potential risk, because there are huge risks in transporting a critically ill babies.\u0027It\u0027s a question of dignity. It puts him at higher risk of dying.\u0027I can understand, as a parent myself, you want to cling on to any straw floating by in the sea to stop you from drowning.\u0027Dr Jayaram compared the case to that of terminally ill baby Charlie Gard last year whose parents were denied the right to take him to America for experimental treatment following court rulings.          Posting photos of himself kissing Pope Francis\u0027s hand, Mr Evans wrote: \u0027Your holiness save our son\u0027He said: \u0027Alfie has a condition that falls into the group of conditions called neurodegenerative conditions.\u0027Some of these have names and some have not got specific names.\u0027This is an important point because one of the arguments being put forward is that there isn\u0027t a diagnosis, there isn\u0027t a name to this neurodegenerative condition.\u0027But people know what it is and we know that the outlook is grim. The brain gradually effectively just dies away.\u0027Alfie\u0027s parents, Tom Evans and Kate James, from Liverpool, have lost fights in the high court, court of appeal, supreme court and European court of human rights (ECHR).They say \u0027the state\u0027 is wrongly interfering with their parental choice and want to move their 23-month-old son to a hospital in Rome for further treatment.Earlier this week Mr Evans met the Pope to plead for more help to save his brain damaged son after flying into Rome last night.He had a 20 minute private audience at the Vatican where the Pontiff agreed to ramp up the campaign to stop his life support being switched off.Posting photos of himself kissing Pope Francis\u0027s hand, Mr Evans wrote: \u0027Your holiness save our son.\u0027 Born on May 9 last year, Alfie is said to be in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition.Specialists at Alder Hey say life-support treatment should stop and judges have accepted evidence that shows further treatment would be futile.On Tuesday Mr Evans asked \u0027Alfie\u0027s Army\u0027 supporters to calm down and quit protesting for a while so they can enjoy time with their son in peace.He said: \u0027Can I ask that after tonight I would really appreciate if everyone has a break from the protesting please?\u0027Me and Kate need to focus on spending precious time with Alfie and focus on the next legal step, keeping the relationship with the staff at ease and peace and make sure no parents are being affected any more.\u0027Earlier this week Merseyside Police called for protesters to respect the safety of staff and patients at the hospital.Chief inspector Chris Gibson said: \u0027While many people have gathered to protest in a peaceful way, Merseyside Police is now investigating a small number of reports, some of which originate from social media, as well as instances of verbal abuse and acts of intimidation from those outside the hospital..\u0027This is extremely unhelpful for all concerned and we are investigating further to establish the full circumstances.\u0027They also expressed \u0027dismay\u0027 and \u0027concern\u0027 over reports supporters of Alfie\u0027s family had gone in to the paediatric intensive care unit at the hospital..An Alder Hey spokesperson said: \u0027We hope that staff will be allowed to continue caring for Alfie and all other children at Alder Hey without interference or disturbance.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/17/4B5099B800000578-5634359-Many_residents_were_trapped_inside_for_hours_as_the_weeds_piled_-a-3_1524154191967.jpg","title":"Tumbleweeds bury homes California Utah","story":"As many as 150 homes in Victorville, California were filled with thousands of tumbleweeds in their front and back yards           Many residents were trapped inside for hours as the weeds piled up as high as the second story or even roofs of homes on MondayBattered boyfriend Alex Skeel tells of his mental tortureMoment teenagers dice with death during heatwave in DevonShocking moment man shoves Met Police officer off moving motorbikeDramatic chatter between Southwest flight 1380 pilot and ATCDavid Copperfield in civil injury trail questioned about guest safetyGreat white shark circles father and his sons before BITING boatJewish man is whipped with a belt in anti-Semitic attack in BerlinCCTV captured moment truck thief hit by car as he steals bikeHilarious moment woman freaks out during Shard VR experienceQueen hosts lunch for Commonwealth leaders at Buckingham PalaceA high wind warning had to be issued for the region, where gusts reached as fast as 70mph, according to the National Weather Service.While tumbleweeds aren\u0027t an uncommon sight in Victorville, many residents told the Victor Valley Daily Press it was the worst they had ever seen.Nav Mangat said one of her neighbors was trapped in his home for two hours until a clean-up crew from the city could clear the front door and garage. \u0027Yesterday I can\u0027t even stand here in my garage,\u0027 she told KABC. \u0027There were like a hundred of these bushes.\u0027           Clean-up crews were sent from the city to help clear the weeds, which have prickly thorns           The weeds were blown in by high winds, which reached speeds of 35 to 70mph in the region           While tumbleweeds aren\u0027t an uncommon sight in Victorville, many residents said it was the worst they had ever seen\u0027They were just flowing like it was a tornado yesterday.\u0027 Homeowners donned gloves and armed themselves with pitchforks as they tried to hold back what they called the \u0027invasion\u0027 of the tumbleweeds. The weeds, which roll in from open fields in the area, are armed with thorns that can scratch the skin -

Should her wish be granted?This group of nations - from Canada to Cameroon, Australia to Antigua - is made up of countries and small islands which Britain inherited, conquered and used to advantage as we built an Empire.We used their people as slaves and cheap labour. We plundered their resources, dumped our convicts on their shores and took hundreds of years to belatedly allow them to claim independence.There’s a strong argument that- in the 21st century - the Commonwealth represents a paternalistic, outdated view of the world.The Queen tells world leaders that it is her \u0027sincere wish\u0027...Theresa May promises to introduce a ban on the sale of...Share this articleNevertheless, ever since the Queen took over as Head following the death of her father George VI, she has enchanted and beguiled the most republican of member states.Elizabeth made the Commonwealth her special project, travelling thousands of miles to visit the 53 territories and realms, and has shown huge compassion and understanding of the issues facing its disparate members.          Her majesty and the heir to the throne (pictured together) are followed out of the ballroom by the Duchess of Wales following today\u0027s Commonwealth summitNow, at 92 on Saturday, she’s anxious to step down, and gave up long-haul travel in 2013.Unlike most of the Commonwealth leaders, Elizabeth was born into immense privilege - she inherited wealth and far-flung places that have few ties to the United Kingdom.There are plenty of reasons why the Commonwealth should not work as a loose grouping of states - but amazingly, it continues to survive, providing a useful forum which draws countries together, rather than apart.Given that the British throne rules a diminishing number of Commonwealth nations - why should the next leader come from the House of Windsor?Would it not be fairer to let the Commonwealth Heads of Government hold a secret ballot and choose who should replace the Queen?The UK’s current immigration crisis - over the British subjects who arrived to work from the Caribbean as part of the ‘Windrush’ scheme, is an embarrassing disgrace during this week of Commonwealth ‘unity’.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe Windrush workers were invited to the UK to help rebuild Britain after the war, and are valued members of society. They were not shirkers, but newcomers who have enriched British culture.A blame game is going on, as politicians squabble over who is responsible for destroying the entry papers of over 50,000 Windrush immgrants, many of whom have been refused the right to work, to claim benefits and receive healthcare, and to obtain a British passport, all because the original documents showing their status cannot be found. Some have even been deported by mistake.This unfortunate cockup reveals how some white British politicians and the Establishment secretly view the Commonwealth.At the Commonwealth Games in Australia the other week, many of the British medal winners will be the grandchildren of Windrush families - we’re proud to call them British when it suits us.The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breeches.          The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breechesIn 2018, the Commonwealth can’t re-inforce the stereotype of a Regal head, someone who dishes out patronage and attends meaningless ceremonies and military events all over the world.The Commonwealth includes countries who still enforce the death penalty, who are not receptive to gay rights and who don’t think women should be allowed abortions. Navigating all that and pushing for change requires diplomacy, tact, and people skills - something which the Queen possesses in spades.To succeed her, a career politician or a charismatic leader is required. The only downside? They might not own palaces, sycophantic staff or be able to afford champagne and swanky canapes.Is Prince Charles truly the best candidate? He rarely looks at ease in these situations, his life has been spent waiting on the sidelines, being indulged and spoilt, and his relationship with his children has only recently improved.          Is Prince Charles truly the best candidate? He rarely looks at ease in these situations His relationship with his former wife was disastrous. Sensing that the handover might be tricky with some Commonwealth members, the Queen has been using her brand to reinforce the notion that the Royal family are willing to take on new challenges involving young people and sexual equality.Highly paid PR people and Private Secretaries are mounting a charm offensive to launch a second wave of junior Royals into key roles.Princess Eugenie - 8th in line to the throne and 15 other Commonwealth realms, according to her Dad’s website - turned up at a reception this week wearing a short dress and scuffed suede boots - hardly a suitable outfit for someone aspiring to ‘lead’ another democracy.Prince Harry - 5th in line to the UK throne and 15 countries - has just been appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his granny.He introduced Meghan Markle, his bride to be, to the assembled youth leaders as if they were leading a world-wide crusade for gay rights. It all sounded a bit like a rehearsal for their wedding next month.The notion that Meghan Markle will be touring the world telling other countries about human rights is patronising in the extreme.I don’t doubt for a moment that the couple are sincere and well-intentioned - but will any political leader be swayed by a woman from a TV soap?

Somewhere around 32,000ft, I heard a loud pop, as we all did. The flight attendants were in the aisle.   Needum was with his mother Julie and wife Stephanie at the press conference. They were on board the plane with him when the engine exploded and sent shrapnel through the passenger window next to Riordan who was sitting seven rows behind them. He fought tears as he told of the moments leading up to the emergency and stopped when he got to that point in the story          Needum, a trained firefighter and EMT, rushed to help ranch hand Tim McGinty who was trying to bring Riordan\u0027s body back into the aircraft. He said McGinty was his \u0027back up\u0027 on the flight and that he was a \u0027big guy\u0027\u0027I immediately looked to them and turned back around and the oxygen masks were deployed,\u0027 he said. Needum was sitting next to his father and his eight-year-old son was by the window.           Jennifer Riordan, 43, died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head, neck and torso. She is pictured with her husband MichaelThey all got their masks on and he turned to look at his wife, mother and five-year-old daughter who were sitting directly across the aisle to ensure they too were safe. Before he went back to help Riordan, he tried to help a young mother who was sitting behind his wife with her six-month-old daughter. She was struggling to put the baby\u0027s oxygen mask on and Needum wanted to help her. \u0027I sat back down and looked across the aisle to my wife after we heard some commotion in the rear of the plane. \u0027I looked at my wife, looked in her eyes, and she gave me the approval to go back there,\u0027 he said.  Like McGinty and Phillips, both of whom were hailed heroes for their efforts on board the flight, Needum said he did \u0027what anyone else would do.\u0027 \u0027I felt moved to act and as well as other people on that plane,\u0027 he said.           This harrowing image taken before the plane made its emergency landing shows the state of the exploded engine           \u0027She made a point of speaking to everyone\u0027: Pilot Tammie Jo Shults spoke to every passenger on the flight after making her emergency landing.

Needum and his wife Stephanie (above together) were in New York City with his parents and their son and daughter for a family vacation. They were on their way home to Texas when the engine exploded on the Southwest Airlines flight          Needum said retired nurse Peggy Phillips (shown above with McGinty once they had landed back in Dallas hours later) was a \u0027special lady\u0027 \u0027She comforted everybody.

My mum who lives closely arrived and she took over. When the paramedics came they tried as well but it was too late. My little girl had gone.\u0027 Miss Walsh explained that her daughter\u0027s bed had a guard on one side, and she thought that stuffing the gap on other side with soft toys would stop Connie Rose from falling and injuring herself.

The new bars (left) are recognisable through the updated packaging reading \u0027Extra Milk \u0026amp Cocoa\u0027. The old bars (right) were discontinuedThe advice, which is likely to sway the European Court of Justice when it makes a final decision, is the latest saga in Nestlé’s battle with rival Cadbury.The companies have been fighting over the right to use the shape for almost 12 years after KitKats were granted protected status by the EU in 2006.Nestlé has long argued the ‘iconic’ design has remained consistent since Rowntree first sold the KitKat, then called Chocolate Crisp, in 1935.After a legal bid by Cadbury’s US owner Mondelez, however, the EU’s general court annulled the registration in 2016 prompting an appeal by Nestlé.In a legal opinion yesterday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) advocate general Melchior Wathelet told judges that they should reject the challenge.‘Nestle did not adduce sufficient evidence to show that its trademark had acquired distinctive character,’ he said.To be given the protection officials would need to show that the product was sufficiently recognisable across the EU’s 28 member states.While Mr Wathelet said that KitKats were distinctive in ten EU countries, he said evidence failed to show the shape was well enough attributable to the brand in Belgium, Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and Portugal.          KitKat Senses - launched in February - are the latest new chocolate from Nestlé - an upmarket version of the famous wafer bars. They come in boxes of 20 bars with three flavours: Salted Caramel, Hazelnut, and Double ChocThe senior legal advisor said the EU office that considers intellectual property issues, such as trademarks, should ‘re-examine’ its entire decision.Although not definitive, judges in the Luxembourg-based court often follow the advice of the advocate general when coming to a final judgement.Nestle’s position in the legal fight has been belittled by the fact that a similar product called Kvikk Lunsj is produced by Cadbury’s parent company in Norway.Have a break¿ have a PINK KitKat!

Boys on scrambler bikes have been tearing up the road outside the hospital as part of at times noisy protests to save Alfie\u0027For visitors, we have been advised to put additional measures in place so our patients and families are able to access vital services without limitation by others.\u0027For example tomorrow, visitors may see more security in the hospital and a more controlled approach to access to certain areas.\u0027This will help us maintain a flow to vital services, so please be patient.\u0027However, Alder Hey remains fully operational with A\u0026ampE open for urgent and emergency care\u0027.The latest demonstration comes on the eve of a court hearing over Alfie\u0027s future.The case is set to be heard in the Court of Appeal this morning after an emergency order was signed by a judge on Thursday night.Just days earlier, a date and time for the withdrawal of Alfie\u0027s medical support had been set. Pope Francis used his traditional Sunday blessing in St Peter\u0027s Square to say he\u0027s praying for British brain damaged toddler Alfie Evans. The pontiff said the situation is \u0027very painful and complex\u0027 as he spoke on Alfie and others who are terminally ill.He expressed hope that they\u0027re always respected in their dignity and cared for in a way suitable to their conditions, with the agreement of family members, doctors and health workers.\u0027  Monsignor Vincenzo Paglia, head of the Pontifical Academy of Life, a Vatican bioethics think tank, said yesterday that Alfie\u0027s parents and hospital officials should work together so his life isn\u0027t \u0027reduced to a legal dispute.\u0027Francis\u0027 comments mark the second time in less than a year that he has intervened in the case of a terminally ill British child. Around 50 people were filmed standing outside Alder Hey hospital last night in protest at a judges ruling in favour of switching off the child\u0027s life support.In the footage the group sing Hero by Mariah Carey as cars and vans sound their horns in support of the tiny tot.

It was part of a tour of campuses organised by the NUS.A previous tour in 2015 included events campaigning against Prevent at Birmingham, Glasgow and Swansea universities.Terrorism expert Professor Anthony Glees, of Buckingham University, said the protest targeting Mr Kaplan was ‘totally unacceptable behaviour’. Prevent is ‘not an obligation on lecturers to spy on students’, he said, adding that staff ‘have a duty of care … to prevent them being drawn into extremism’.‘The hounding of this man is unacceptable and inconsistent with what should go on in a university.’ Westminster University said it supports students’ rights to make their voices heard through peaceful protest, but a spokesman added: ‘The university condemns the public naming of a member of our staff and the calls for his removal.’A Soas spokesman said its approach to Prevent was primarily ‘safeguarding the welfare our students and staff’ but that this is ‘balanced against our fundamental commitment to academic freedom’.Mr Olatunji said: ‘Students from different universities and a wide range of student groups organised independently and protested against the implementation of the widely discredited Prevent duty at the University of Westminster.‘Yusuf Kaplan has been identified as a key figurehead in pushing for draconian implementation of this policy … The protest was intended to disrupt actions at the university and push for increased transparency … which it has successfully done.’Miss Koutteineh did not respond to requests for comment.  Poor, little rich kids who spout hatredMIDDLE CLASS CHEERLEADER FOR TERRORIST GROUPSFarah Koutteineh, an international relations student at Westminster University orchestrated the campaign demanding the sacking of Yusuf Kaplan.

The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested  There could be little doubt about the prevailing view among the members as they assembled at Buckingham Palace yesterday morning for the opening ceremony of the largest Commonwealth summit in the organisation\u0027s history.It came despite reports claiming that some Commonwealth leaders remain \u0027underwhelmed\u0027 by the Prince of Wales, while senior Labour figures, including leader Jeremy Corbyn, have questioned whether he should be honoured with the role.It fell to the Maltese prime minister, as the Commonwealth\u0027s outgoing chair-in-office, to speak on behalf of his colleagues.\u0027We are elated by the vigour with which the Prince of Wales actively participates in Commonwealth affairs,\u0027 said Dr Joseph Muscat. \u0027We are certain that when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth.\u0027It remains to be seen whether the leaders decide to formalise this intention in today\u0027s end-of-summit communique. Since there is no constitutional rule about the headship, there is no requirement to do so.And although there is no vacancy yet, this was still a landmark moment. The prince has been quietly assuming more and more of the monarch\u0027s duties – investitures, overseas tours and, most recently, honouring the fallen at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday.           The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things But the Commonwealth question has always been studiously avoided. The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested.Yet having visited 44 of the 53 nations of the Commonwealth (he has been to ten in the past year alone) and having known all its leaders since birth, he probably understands \u0027the club\u0027 better than anyone alive, with the exception of his parents.Yesterday he spoke fondly of what has been \u0027a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember\u0027 and of bygone Commonwealth statesmen such as Pierre Trudeau, former prime minister of Canada, and Jomo Kenyatta, former president of Kenya. Both men\u0027s sons – Justin Trudeau and Uhuru Kenyatta – have since followed their fathers into politics. Both of them were seated on the stage yesterday with the other premiers. The Windsors are certainly not the only Commonwealth dynasty.The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things.Over nearly seven decades she has held this argumentative organisation-cum-clan together, listening to their troubles in endless private audiences, wining and dining them, breaking up fights and generally keeping the show on the road.But this was the nearest she has ever come to an instruction.Cleverly, she talked of the prince continuing her father\u0027s work as well as her own.  The Queen has told foreign dignitaries of her \u0027sincere wish\u0027 that they pick Prince Charles to take over as leader of the Commonwealth during a large summit at Buckingham Palace Commonwealth summits are unlike any other, not least because there are no interpreters. The family atmosphere was evident even before the start yesterday as the leaders gathered in the Blue Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace.Usually, royal guests in the state apartments stand around nervously, trying not to touch anything. This lot swaggered in, many giving each other bear hugs, and cheerfully plonked themselves down on priceless sofas and chairs, making themselves thoroughly at home.It is one of the reasons why the Queen has always enjoyed these summits, and why there was an added poignancy to yesterday\u0027s proceedings. For this was a farewell of sorts – not that anyone put it quite like that.The Queen, who celebrates her 92nd birthday tomorrow, no longer undertakes long-haul travel. These Commonwealth summits, held every other year, take place in Britain only every 20 years or so. The next one is scheduled for Malaysia, and the Prince of Wales will represent the Queen there.She will continue to play an active part in Commonwealth affairs and meet its leaders when they are in Britain. But her days of far-away summits are over.It explains why this gathering had attracted the largest number of premiers in Commonwealth history, with 47 heads of government present among 53 delegations.She attended her first gathering of its leaders as a princess, when her father, King George VI, created the modern organisation out of the remnants of the British Empire. There were only eight members of the Commonwealth when the Queen came to the throne.          Britain\u0027s Prince Charles greets India\u0027s Prime Narendra Modi in a receiving line for the Queen\u0027s Dinner on Thursday night In 1953, she was the dazzling debutante head surrounded by grand old stagers like Churchill, Menzies and Nehru. She would entertain the Commonwealth prime ministers on their annual trips to London until they decided to rotate these gatherings among the member nations. In 1971 the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (or CHOGM) took place in Singapore.Prime Minister Edward Heath formally advised the Queen not to attend. He warned that there would be a row over British arms sales to South Africa and that there would be a toxic atmosphere – as indeed there was. The Commonwealth came close to imploding there and then.The Queen was adamant that she would never miss another one. She has been turning up ever since, holding her audiences, her banquets and her receptions (with the exception of 2013, when the new long-haul ban ruled out a journey to Sri Lanka). All through the 1970s and 80s, all through the bust-ups over Rhodesia and South Africa, she was there in the wings, defusing the tension, raising the tone, nudging the organisation towards consensus rather than polarisation.Along the way, the Commonwealth would enjoy great triumphs – notably the end of apartheid, the return of South Africa to \u0027the club\u0027 and the creation of an independent Zimbabwe.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe fact that dozens of ex-colonies have maintained such a close bond with the once-loathed ex-imperial Crown has been, in no small part, down to the way the Queen has personally reframed that relationship.In recent years, the Commonwealth may have lost its way at a political level, eclipsed by a myriad of grander, flashier copycats – the G20, the EU and so on. Its critics suggest it is an outdated, clapped-out post-imperial has-been. But it still does its best work at the people-to-people level through numerous grass-roots associations, plugging away on tiny budgets.It has plenty of admirers and jealous rivals. The French have done their best to emulate it. There are many nations who want to join.This is a unique outfit with a unique character, forged through shared bonds of history, language, law and sacrifice. Last night\u0027s dinner was proof of that. State banquets at the Palace always have a U-shaped table with the Queen at the top. Not this one.     Last night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt Missing his Markle: Harry and William join the Queen as she...British fishing firm can appeal against a controversial...How and when will we know if Prince Charles will succeed the...King of Swaziland renames the country Kingdom of eSwatini to...Share this articleLast night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt. She sat between Dr Muscat of Malta and president Adama Barrow of The Gambia (now a Commonwealth member once more, having recently ejected the madman who used to be in charge).All the Royal Family were there, with the exception of a convalescing Prince Philip and a heavily pregnant Duchess of Cambridge. Spread all around the Picture Gallery was that old ex-imperial family to which the Queen pledged herself on her 21st birthday.By tradition, a summit newcomer had been invited to raise the toast to the Queen at the black tie banquet. President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana struck a somewhat melancholy note as he expressed \u0027our collective regret that she will no longer automatically be present at our proceedings\u0027.But he voiced a \u0027fervent hope\u0027 that \u0027her deep love for this association will continue to light the way for all of us\u0027.

One in five admit they speed for the thrill of driving so quickly.Rob Miles, director of car insurance at Direct Line said: \u0027Speeding is one of the biggest causes of accidents and casualties on UK roads. The research suggests that it is often not deliberate, as drivers may be unaware that they may are creeping above the limit. However, speed limits are set for a reason and 20mph and 30mph zones are often around schools, hospitals and other highly pedestrianised zones, where going over the limit could prove fatal in the event of an accident.\u0027The findings come amid calls from a senior police officer to get rid of the 10 per cent \u0027buffer\u0027 over the signposted limit that most police forces allow.          Millions believe there are \u0027acceptable\u0027 upper speeds they can drive at above the limitThey are typically given another 2mph allowance above this level.This leeway, which also applies to those caught on camera, is equivalent to being allowed to travel at 68mph in a 60mph zone or 35 mph in a 30mph zone.But earlier this year the chief constable of West Mercia police force Anthony Bangham said the days of the \u0027soft\u0027 treatment of offenders must come to an end.Mr Bangham, who is the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council lead on road policy, sparked a backlash from motoring campaigners and MPs for appearing to suggest that drivers should be given a ticket for travelling just 1mph over the speed limit.Mr Bangham quickly backtracked and said his comments had been misunderstood.EXCLUSIVE: Black man arrested in Starbucks was a repeat...Driver jailed for 12 years for running over pedestrian\u0027s...\u0027Ain\u0027t nobody got time for this!\u0027 911 operator is jailed for...Share this articleAnthony Bangham admitted punishing drivers for straying just one mph over the limit would not be \u0027proportionate or achievable\u0027.But speeding remains a huge problem.The equivalent of four people a minute were caught speeding in 2016, according to figures from the Home Office.In 2016 a total of 1.97 million fixed penalty notices were issued for speed limit offences across England and Wales, an extra 25,000 compared to 2015 and 107,000 compared to 2014.The most recent figures available from the Department for Transport show there were 1,792 road deaths reported in 2016 - up 4 per cent from 2015 and the highest annual total since 2011. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/00/4B41FFB300000578-0-image-a-5_1524181599124.jpg","title":"QUENTIN LETTS yesterday Parliament Yikes rude MPs","story":"    Sir William Cash asked John Bercow, pictured, asked whether trolling MPs was Contempt of Parliament whether they are abused outside or inside the house          Sir William raised the anti-Semitic abuse suffered by Labour\u0027s Ruth Smeeth, picturedHe noted the anti-Semitic abuse aimed at Labour MPs – including Stoke North’s Ruth Smeeth and Liverpool Wavertree’s Luciana Berger.

Sir William, who is among other things a country solicitor, said that the parliamentary manual ‘Erskine May’ stated it was a Contempt of Parliament ‘to molest and intimidate Members by abusive language outside or inside the precincts of the House’.

If Sir William wished to pursue the matter, he should write to him. Mr Bercow said there was ‘a concern to protect the rights of all members of the House – any members could be similarly affected’.You may ask: what is ‘Contempt of the House’ and what are the associated penalties? Contempt may be misusing the parliamentary portcullis motif or it may be passing yourself off as a parliamentary agent. It is a Contempt of the Commons to leak details of a select committee report, to be ‘disorderly or disrespectful’ on the parliamentary estate or in one of its committees, or to obstruct MPs or parliamentary officials in their duties.In the past, the House has summoned offenders to the ‘Bar of the House’ (ie the edge of the Chamber) for a reprimand. That happened in 1957 to the feisty Sunday Express editor Sir John Junor after he suggested MPs had dodged petrol rationing. Contempt culprits have also been fined and locked up in the Palace of Westminster gaol.The last to suffer that fate, in 1880, was one Charles Grizzell, a former naval lieutenant who publicly suggested he could ‘control’ a Commons committee. Modern lobbyists, please note.Grizzell legged it to Boulogne, so the Serjeant at Arms locked up his lawyer instead. See? Lawyers do have their uses.If Speaker Bercow is obliged to look into the contempt issue by Sir William, he will find that 1880’s clock-tower cell is now used for different purposes. Speaker’s Counsel may also advise him that compliance with various human rights laws may have made it harder for the Commons to impose its authority on scurvy members of the public.All this is less academic than it might sound. Only this week, the Culture select committee was flicked a V-sign by Alexander Nix of data company Cambridge Analytica. The committee wanted him to give evidence at a hearing. He told it to get stuffed. There remains an uneasy stand-off, parliamentary clerks at present just muttering dark threats.For sketchwriters – and any others who feel today’s politicians sometimes deserve raspberries (though never to the degree aimed at MPs Smeeth \u0026amp Co), this ice feels thin. A Commons factsheet says Contempt of the House may include ‘reflections on the character or impartiality of the Speaker or Deputy Speakers’.Yikes. Speaker Bercow and his predecessor have done to the Chair’s dignity what Uri Geller used to do to teaspoons. Bercow’s impartiality can be as skimpy as Borat’s thong.We may condemn recent abuse of MPs. Let it be examined for illegality under incitement laws. But in an age when parliamentarians have drifted so far from the voters, it would be a mistake to revive the notion of Contempt of the House."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/00/4B5549D000000578-0-image-m-89_1524179025556.jpg","title":"Pale gaunt Prince seen visiting doctor check up","story":"    This footage shows Prince visiting the office of Dr Michael Todd Schulenberg on April 20, one day before he died Prince was seen entering Dr Schulenberg\u0027s clinic on April 20 where he said he felt \u0027antsy\u0027 and suggested it was because he had stopped taking the non-opioid painkiller Tylenol that morning.He received a urine test and the results tested positive for opiates. This led Dr Schulenberg to suggest he could be suffering from opiate withdrawal.The Walgreens video, meanwhile, shows the singer\u0027s assistant entering the store at 5.45pm and 7pm and taking away medicines. Prince is thought to have taken out prescriptions at Walgreens stores four times in the week leading up to his death.Family members also claimed he passed at least eight pharmacies before entering Walgreens, leading to suggestions he could have picked up multiple prescriptions and tried to hide the paper trail, TMZ reported.Haunting images show the inside of Prince\u0027s Paisley Park...How and when will we know if Prince Charles will succeed the...The Queen tells world leaders that it is her \u0027sincere wish\u0027...Share this articleThe source of the Fentanyl-laced pills that were responsible for Prince\u0027s overdose is still not known.The Midwest Medical Examiner\u0027s report, released on Thursday, did reveal however that Prince himself had no idea the pills contained Fentanyl. Instead, the singer thought he was taking Vicodin in the days and weeks leading up to his death.This would suggest that neither Prince nor those close to him knew that he was addicted to Fentanyl at the time of his death.Prince died of a self-administered Fentanyl overdose according to an autopsy report released by the Midwest Medical Examiner\u0027s Office.    The Carver County Sheriff\u0027s Department also released video taken at a nearby Walgreens, also on April 20, that shows Prince\u0027s assistant filling two prescriptions within hoursThe singer\u0027s death was ruled an accident, and the only listed cause on the medical examiner\u0027s report was \u0027Fentanyl toxicity\u0027.It is unclear if that autopsy report will be edited in the wake of this new information.Prince\u0027s unresponsive body was discovered on April 21 inside an elevator at his Paisley Park estate just outside Minneapolis, Minnesota.Prince\u0027s former drug dealer believed opioids were behind the singer\u0027s death when he spoke exclusively to DailyMail.com.          Gone too soon: The doctor who prescribed Prince opioid painkillers just before his death will pay a $30,000 fineHe also revealed that the performer would spend up to $40,000 on six-month supplies of two drugs - Dilaudid pills and Fentanyl patches.Prince\u0027s dealer - who asked to be identified as Doctor D - said that he sold drugs to Prince from 1984 to 2008 and described the singer as \u0027majorly addicted\u0027.He sold him the drugs he explained because Prince was too afraid of doctors to obtain a prescription, but also had stage fright and needed them to get out and perform on stage.\u0027I first met Prince in 1984 while he was filming the movie Purple Rain and he was already majorly addicted to opiates - I didn\u0027t hook him on drugs he was already a really heavy user,\u0027 said Doctor D.\u0027In the beginning he would buy speed as well as Dilaudid. I would sell him black beauties which were a black pill and cross tops which were also speed pills.\u0027He would use that as a counterbalance to get back up again from taking opiates. That lasted for a couple of years then he would just buy Dilaudid, which is a heroin based opiate. It is highly addictive. \u0027As far as I knew he never took heroin - as that would leave you out of it for days whereas Dilaudid gives you an energy buzz as well as making you feel relaxed - so he preferred it.\u0027          Images released by the Midwest Medical Examiner\u0027s office show bottles of pills that were found in Prince\u0027s residence  It is not clear where Prince obtained the Fentanyl-laced pills that killed him. Pictured is a photo released by the medical examiner showing a pouch with the word \u0027opium\u0027 written on itHe went on to say about Prince: \u0027He needed the drugs because he was so nervous - he could be nervous in a room with just five people in it.\u0027He was scared to go out in public, he was scared to talk to people and didn\u0027t like to go on stage - he had the worst case of stage fright I\u0027d ever seen.          Dr Michael Todd Schulenberg, who has agreed to pay $30,000 to settle a federal civil violation over Prince\u0027s death is seen in an undated file photo\u0027A lot of performers rely on drugs to make them feel confident on stage but he was by far the worse.\u0027Plus he was always paranoid about doctors so he wouldn\u0027t ask them for help - he had a phobia of them.\u0027I was surprised when I heard he had been picking up prescriptions before he died.\u0027Doctor D also seemed to think that if Prince had been prescribed Percocet by a doctor that could have caused his death, suggesting that even Diludid would have been a safer choice for the singer.It was reported shortly after Prince\u0027s death that the highly addictive painkiller Percocet - which contains both acetaminophen and oxycodone - had been found in his system. There were also reports around that time claiming Prince had been treated for an overdose of Percocet just six days before his death.          Images from inside Prince\u0027s  Paisley Park estate showed how it was left after the singer\u0027s overdose          Prince\u0027s body was recovered from outside the entrance to the elevator (pictured). Much of Prince\u0027s decor reflects his flair for the artistic - such as this yellow sun pattern, on a blue carpet \u0027If Prince was just taking Dilaudid he would still be alive,\u0027 Dr Dsaid.\u0027It has less side effects than other opiate drugs such as Percocet but doctors don\u0027t like to prescribe it because it\u0027s one of the heaviest drugs.\u0027The problem with Percocet is that it is an opiate mixed with Tylenol - but he would have been taking much more than the recommended dose because he had developed a tolerance to opiates over the years.\u0027When you take that much Tylenol it can cause major problems - especially with your kidneys.\u0027But doctors would have freaked out if they knew the extent of Prince\u0027s drug problem and wouldn\u0027t know what to do.\u0027    The singer\u0027s vault contained shelf after shelf of private documents, files and even drugs           Another image of the inside of Prince\u0027s Paisley Park compound where he overdosed on FentanylHe added about the singer: \u0027He self medicated for years and was fine - so it wouldn\u0027t have been the opiates that killed him but the Tylenol.\u0027So perversely the doctors who thought they were helping him may have hurt him by prescribing Percocet.\u0027Also if they did have to give him a save shot when he overdosed like everybody is saying - that removes all traces of drugs from your system so he would have started to go into withdrawal and would have had to take a lot of drugs to feel okay again - which also could have killed him.\u0027You can\u0027t just stop taking these drugs when you have taken them for so long.\u0027But without knowing his drug history doctors wouldn\u0027t have known that.\u0027It explains why he was spotted looking nervous and pacing around at the pharmacy in the week before his death.\u0027Officials had said that the main reason the federal authorities had been brought in was so the investigation could cover the multiple states Prince had visited in the weeks before his death.          A small suitcase offers a glimpse of life at the home a wad of cash, two bottles of pills, and a box of hair dye          A shoe rack displays some of the famously short singer\u0027s eclectic taste in shoes. Many are heeled, and are metallic or glittery           These containers of pills were also found on the singer\u0027s vast estate where he died on April 21 Prince\u0027s private jet made an emergency landing in Moline, Illinois, six days before he died so he could be rushed to hospital.The singer, who was flying from a show in Atlanta, was treated for flu and did not stay the night at the hospital.He appeared at a dance party in Minnesota just days before his death to let his fans know he was recovering, telling them: \u0027Wait a few days before you waste any prayers.\u0027Prince was last pictured the night before his death leaving a Walgreen\u0027s near his home around 7pm, marking the fourth time the singer had been to the pharmacy that week.An hour later, he headed back inside his vast estate and 13 hours later he was found by friend Kirk Johnson and personal assistant Meron Bekure lying unresponsive in an elevator.Paramedics performed CPR upon arriving on the scene five minutes after receiving a 911 call but were not successful in reviving the singer.          A desk is covered with artwork, next to a Bible and a dictionary, as well as a random assortment of cash, electronics and even a floppy disk           A note was found at the house, which recommends a mixture of stress relieving and fat burning drugs and remedies. One L-Tyrosine tablet was prescribed once in the morning, for stress, two Myocalm - bioavailable forms of calcium and magnesium which affect muscle contraction and relaxation, were to be taken in the evening, along with two Rhodiola, also known as \u0027golden root,\u0027 a herb with fat-burning and energy-enhancing propertiesOfficials later stated that the singer was likely dead for approximately six hours before his body was found.An autopsy was performed the following day.The day before Prince died, his representatives reached out to California doctor Dr Howard Kornfeld to arrange a meeting according to a lawyer for the doctor.Attorney William Mauzy said Dr Kornfeld had never met or spoken to Prince before Prince\u0027s representatives contacted him on April 20.Mauzy said Dr Kornfeld was not able to travel immediately to Minnesota, so he arranged for his son Andrew to go instead.Andrew Kornfeld took a late flight on April 20 so he could be at Prince\u0027s Paisley Park studio complex the next morning. When he got there, he was with Johnson and Burke when they found Prince in the elevator, and it was he who called 911.Mauzy said Andrew was carrying a small amount of buprenorphine, which is used to treat addiction and offers pain relief with less possibility of overdose and addiction.He added that Andrew never intended to give the medication to Prince, and instead planned to give it to the Minnesota doctor who was scheduled to see Prince.The identity of that doctor is still not known at this time.Mauzy also said the elder Kornfeld arranged for a Minnesota doctor to evaluate Prince, and that the doctor had cleared his schedule for the following morning but Prince was found unresponsive before that could happen.          The singer\u0027s body was laying outside an elevator on the ground floor of the compound, where he had lived for almost all of his adult life\u0027Dr. Kornfeld was never able to meet Prince, never talked to Prince, and sadly, unable to arrive in time to help Prince,\u0027 Mauzy told reporters.When asked about the legality of his carrying buprenorphine, Mauzy declined to answer. But he said he believed Minnesota law would protect Andrew from any potential charges related to Prince\u0027s death.Under the law, a person who seeks medical assistance for someone who is overdosing on drugs may not be prosecuted for possessing or sharing controlled substances, under certain circumstances.Mauzy said it was not uncommon for Dr Kornfeld to send his son on his behalf.He said Andrew is a pre-med student and that convincing people to seek treatment is something \u0027he has done for years\u0027.The same official also said investigators are looking at whether Prince had suffered an overdose when his plane made the emergency landing in Illinois.Dr Kornfeld runs Recovery Without Walls in Mill Valley, California. His website describes the practice as \u0027specializing in innovative, evidence-based medical treatment for chronic pain and drug and alcohol addiction\u0027.Andrew is listed on the website as a practice consultant.          Many of the walls of the house are festooned with Prince\u0027s achievements, such as these columns which feature some of his best selling albums Mauzy said Prince\u0027s representatives told Dr Kornfeld that the singer was \u0027dealing with a grave medical emergency\u0027, however the doctor did not explain what the issue was.Mauzy said Dr Kornfeld hoped to get Prince \u0027stabilized in Minnesota and convince him to come to Recovery Without Walls in Mill Valley. That was the plan\u0027.Stuart Gitlow, an addiction medicine expert speaking without direct knowledge of Prince\u0027s case, questioned whether Dr Kornfeld and his son acted appropriately.\u0027If a physician feels that a patient is having an emergency, his obligation is to call an ambulance and get the patient to emergency personnel who can assess the situation — not to fly to the patient,\u0027 Gitlow said.\u0027It\u0027s not routine for doctors to fly across the country to start people on buprenorphine,\u0027 said Gitlow, a past president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine and a faculty member of the University of Florida.\u0027That\u0027s something that can be handled locally.\u0027Prince, who over the course of his career won seven Grammy Awards, seemed to live a remarkably healthy life, having been a strict vegan for over a decade and becoming a Jehovah\u0027s Witness in 2001, a faith that largely prohibits the consumption of alcohol."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/21/4B49FB2900000578-0-image-a-4_1524082396604.jpg","title":"Unstoppable New film documents one armed surfer Bethany Hamiltons journey game","story":"    Bethany Hamilton, 28, is one of the world\u0027s top surfers and allowed filmmaker Aaron Lieber extraordinary access to her life - documenting her journey from childhood in Hawaii through a shark attack that took her left arm through her rise back to the heights of international surfing          The new documentary - Bethany Hamilton: Unstoppable - also offers intimate glimpses into Hamilton\u0027s family life with husband Adam and son Tobias birth just last month she announced the birth of her second child, Wesley Phillip, not pictured          The film includes incredible footage and underwater shots, in addition to using home video footage and interviews with friends, family and members of the surfing community  Following the birth of Wesley, left, Hamilton said she and her family were \u0027overjoyed\u0027 to welcome him into the world and \u0027it\u0027s been a beautiful time getting life started with the four of us\u0027          Hamilton says in the film that motherhood had been a lifelong dream of hers‘I think it was a unique time for us – for her to realize that I’m there for her, to bring her through any challenges, that … we’re going to figure out a way to make our lives work with this kid and still be able to do the things that we love,’ Bethany’s husband, Adam, says in the documentary, which premieres this week at the Tribeca Film Festival.Bethany adds: ‘As I started to see his excitement and, like, the other people’s excitement around me, I was like, wow, this is a gift from God.’One person who was in on the secret from a very early stage was filmmaker Aaron Lieber, who was making the documentary about Bethany’s life and who flew to Hawaii to continue documenting her journey – witnessing firsthand the grueling workout regime she maintained and even capturing astounding footage of the surfer on her board while heavily pregnant.‘My surfing got smoother I got better at surfing while I was pregnant,’ says Bethany, with a hint of incredulity.Lieber, for one, remained awed by her determination, routine and physical strength. He’d wanted to tell her story not just as a shark attack survivor or amputee but as an indomitable athlete whose surfing, attitude and routine were practically unrivalled – and Bethany’s fortitude through her unexpected pregnancy, and afterwards, completely fit with the ‘unstoppable’ theme.She gave birth to her first son, Tobias, on June 1, 2015 – and she was back on her board a few short weeks later, preparing for yet another competition. (Her second son, Wesley Phillip, was born just last month.)‘What really impresses me, and it still does to this day, is just her work ethic,’ Lieber tells DailyMail.com. ‘I’m eating a burger, I’m winding down she’s going to bed with Tobias and doing an ab workout in bed – not that I’ve seen her do it, but her husband Adam is like, “Dude, she’s doing abs in the morning, at night…” She just has this ability to go, “I am going to push through the pain and get this done.”’He points to an incident from a surfing trip to Bali with Bethany that illustrates that perseverance.‘She popped her rib out she was having trouble breathing, in a lot of pain,’ Lieber says. ‘She didn’t tell me ‘til the trip was over! Two weeks later, she was like, “Oh, yeah, I popped my rib out, I was in a lot of pain, but I didn’t want to complain.”’He adds: ‘Her work ethic, you kind of see it, but then once you get to work with her, you’re like, “Oh wow – you are on another level.”’Battered boyfriend Alex Skeel tells of his mental tortureMoment teenagers dice with death during heatwave in DevonShocking moment man shoves Met Police officer off moving motorbikeDramatic chatter between Southwest flight 1380 pilot and ATCDavid Copperfield in civil injury trail questioned about guest safetyGreat white shark circles father and his sons before BITING boatJewish man is whipped with a belt in anti-Semitic attack in BerlinCCTV captured moment truck thief hit by car as he steals bikeHilarious moment woman freaks out during Shard VR experienceQueen hosts lunch for Commonwealth leaders at Buckingham Palace    Hamilton, hospitalized after a shark attacked her and bit off her left arm while she was surfing in Hawaii, was determined to continue excelling at the sport she lovedPhoto courtesy of Noah Hamilton Photography          Hamilton competes in the Outerknown Fiji Women\u0027s Pro surfing competition in Fiji in May 2017 fellow pro surfer Tyler Wright says in the film: ‘How she’s been able to adapt and be the powerhouse that she is is absolutely incredible\u0027          Hamilton is pictured with filmmaker Lieber, who tells DailyMail.com: \u0027She could’ve chosen to live a quiet and simple life, but she has this passion for surfing, and so she works at it … My idea was to tell her story in an authentic way, and I hoped that would resonate with people and inspire them, whatever they’re struggling with in their life’          Hamilton married her husband Adam, who worked in youth ministry, in 2013 she found out she was pregnant the following year and admits in the film that she initially found the news difficult, though she had always hoped to one day be a parent          Hamilton continued to surf and even compete while pregnant she says in the film that her surfing \u0027got smoother I got better at surfing while I was pregnant\u0027The making of the film was ‘kind of this three-year process of seeing her ability against the best female surfers in the world, and seeing that there was something there beyond this idea of, yeah, she survived a shark attack. Cool,’ says Lieber, referring to when a 14-foot tiger shark bit off Hamilton’s arm in October 2003.‘But really she’s one of the best female surfers in the world – and that’s what sparked my interest, like, wow, this could be something really special,’ the filmmaker tells DailyMail.com.‘I saw all these goals that she had for her life and all these dreams and, you know, it can be challenging when people in the world tend to try to put you in this box of this or that … my goal was to capture her and document her and tell her story that is authentic to who she is.‘We’re not trying to put a twist on this or that being with her for four years and getting to know her so well really allowed me the ability to tell her story from her perspective – and obviously mine as well – but really trying to get in there and bring all that to the surface. And she works so hard.‘A lot of her peers are competing month in and month out on the world tour, so you have that peer-to-peer competition – whereas she’s doing it off on her own. To get as good as she’s gotten by herself is a feat in and of itself, regardless of limb loss or not. To work that hard is just an incredible thing to watch and really inspiring for me.’The film traces Bethany’s surf dreams from childhood, which she spent on Hawaii with her siblings and parents, all avid surfers, as her mom and dad worked multiple jobs to support the family. Her mother delivered magazines, Bethany explains in the film, enabling her to tag along on trips and surf different spots all over the island. The documentary features interviews with her family, friends, peers and others – and includes not only intimate scenes filmed by Lieber but old footage from family home videos.In one clip, filmed before Bethany lost her arm, her mother Cheri chats with Bethany and her best friend.‘Are you concerned about sharks at all? How do you deal with it?’ Cheri asks.‘Just pray,’ says a young Bethany.Her strong Christian faith sustained her after the loss of her arm she says she knew six days after the attack that she wanted to get back on her board – and she was also inspired by another surfer, Mike Coots, who continued surfing after losing his leg in a shark attack.  Hamilton is pictured before the shark attack, left, after which she wrote the book Soul Surfer, which was a New York Times bestseller later turned into a movie starring Helen Hunt, Dennis Quaid and AnnaSophia Robb          Hamilton, who became an inspirational figure around the globe following the attack and her triumphant return to surfing, has credited her strong Christian faith with helping her through the experience  Hamilton and her husband - who director Lieber calls \u0027a solid, calm, smart and supportive person\u0027 - discuss their relationship in the film she says ‘I couldn’t be where I am today without the way that he’s supported me’Family footage included in the documentary shows Hamilton and Coots chatting while she’s still in the hospital he assures the young surfer that he’s tried paddling with one arm, and it can be done – and the 13-year-old looks completely confident that she’ll get the hang of it. Sure enough, she was soon surfing again – and winning.Unstoppable follows Hamilton as she surfs some of the world’s toughest waves and Lieber, well known for his surf cinematography, worked hard to get the best shots – whether he was underwater with a go-pro or mounting a camera on her board.‘For people who don’t surf, it’s interesting and informative,’ says Lieber – adding that Hamilton’s success story translates far beyond the world of competitive surfing.‘I think we’re in a really unique space right now with everything happening politically in our country, with the women’s movement and all these different things,’ he says. ‘I think the film could speak volumes to so many, and I hope it does.‘I hope, in a world where everything seems to be a little negative spin right now, hopefully this is a little shine of positivity.’He says: ‘I really want this to impact the next generation of women coming up.’Incredible photos reveal the moment a father-of-two is...\u0027Any time, something can happen to one of us\u0027: Pro surfers...\u0027You went out surfing!\u0027 Simon Baker is scolded by reporter...Share this articleHe applauds Hamilton’s honesty and openness in the film, which showcases many intimate moments in her life – not least her struggle to accept her pregnancy.‘It’s been really fun watching her and Adam become parents,’ Lieber says. ‘That is a quantum shift from just thinking about yourself and what you want to achieve. Before she met Adam – you see I tin the film – it was very draining to go out into the world by herself and always having to be the rock in tough situations emotionally. So when Adam and her came together, Adam was (and is to this day) such a solid, calm, smart and supportive person.‘Them coming together, I saw Bethany blossom in a whole new way. That was so fun to watch and obviously to document.’     Hamilton and her husband, a former youth minister, are also very candid about their relationship in the film.‘Being a guy, I want to provide,’ says Adam, who is originally from Kansas and worked in youth ministry before traveling the world with Bethany. ‘I want to be depended on, because that’s how I grew up. That’s how everyone I knew grew up. It was definitely, like, challenging. I started out thinking, okay, for this few years or something I’m going to support Bethany and things are going to like phase out and then I’ll get a job.’She, however, says: ‘I think it would just be really hard on us to be separated so much, if he was busy with our own endeavors.’‘There’s definitely a balance that we’re trying to find,’ he says – with his wife conceding: ‘I couldn’t be where I am today without the way that he’s supported me.’           Hamilton shared details on social media of her workout regime throughout her second pregnancy, adding that she surfed up until she was about six and a half months pregnant           Hamilton\u0027s grueling workout regime is chronicled in Unstoppable, with everyone from interview subjects to the director himself marveling at her nonstop commitment to fitness          Lieber shares how Hamilton\u0027s husband told him that the surfer would often retire to bed at night with her son Tobias and still do abs workouts          Hamilton shares her love of fitness and a healthy lifestyle with fans and hopes to inspire people around the world          Lieber, who is renowned for his surf cinematography, went to great lengths to achieve the best shots for the documentary, whether it be using a Gopro underwater or mounting cameras to boards          Hamilton’s friend and fellow Hawaiian pro surfer Carissa Moore says: ‘The craziest thing for me is seeing her here in Fiji as a mom and multitasking between heats – holding Tobias, making it all happen and keeping things organized and focused – which is so cool for all the girls on tour, especially me. ‘I was like, I’m going to way til my career’s over and then have kids it’s really cool to see, hey, you can do both’          Bethany \u0027popped out a rib\u0027 while filming but didn\u0027t tell Lieber for more than a week he says \u0027She just has this ability to go, “I am going to push through the pain and get this done”’          Director Lieber says: ‘I think we’re in a really unique space right now with everything happening politically in our country, with the women’s movement and all these different things ... I think the film could speak volumes to so many, and I hope it does. ‘I hope, in a world where everything seems to be a little negative spin right now, hopefully this is a little shine of positivity.’And her friends and competitors, interviewed in the film, marvel at the level of her skill – and her unstoppable drive.‘How she’s been able to adapt and be the powerhouse that she is is absolutely incredible,’ pro surfer Tyler Wright says. ‘I don’t know how she does it.’Hamilton’s friend and fellow Hawaiian pro surfer Carissa Moore says: ‘The craziest thing for me is seeing her here in Fiji as a mom and multitasking between heats – holding Tobias, making it all happen and keeping things organized and focused – which is so cool for all the girls on tour, especially me.‘I was like, I’m going to way til my career’s over and then have kids it’s really cool to see, hey, you can do both.’And the point of the documentary is exactly that, Lieber says – showing viewers, and especially young women, what can be achieved through determination and perseverance.‘My idea is that people can be unstoppable in their own lives, and it’s a choice,’ he tells DailyMail.com. ‘She could’ve chosen to, like she says in the film, she could’ve chosen to live a quiet and simple life, but she has this passion for surfing, and so she works at it … there’s all these messages that are kind of layered in there.‘The idea of, just be unstoppable … you could apply that to your health: “Okay, I’m going to really buckle down and be healthy” or you could apply that to mental illness. There’s so many different things for everybody. My idea was to tell her story in an authentic way, and I hoped that would resonate with people and inspire them, whatever they’re struggling with in their life.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/12/4B50071C00000578-5632287-image-a-56_1524138068616.jpg","title":"Britain set HOTTEST April day nearly 70 years today","story":"    Sunbathers flock to the Hot Walls in Portsmouth this morning to make the most of the sunshine          Daisy Goodman (21), right and Alley Dixon (27), left enjoy the warm weather as they relax on deckchairs at Newcastle\u0027s Quayside Seaside on the banks of the River Tyne          Sunbathers made the most of the hot weather as they laid in London\u0027s Greenwich Park on the warmest day of the year so far    A young woman is pictured making the most of the sun on the beach in Bournemouth, Dorset as temperatures soared to their hottest level in April since 1949 There is a possibility than Northern Ireland will hit temperatures of 66F (19C) while Scotland could hit 68F (20C).

Kilham, with help from his sister Phoebe and his wife Debbie, takes in orphaned bear cubs until they\u0027re old enough to fend for themselves  Kilham takes in orphaned bear cubs until they are old enough to fend for themselves  A black bear roams the property of wildlife biologist Ben Kilham in Lyme, New HampshireIn addition he observes adult bears in the wild, including Squirty, who is now 22 years old and has had 11 litters.His dedication to black bears -- the most common in North America with a population of around 750,000 -- has made him such an expert that China asked for his help with the giant panda, a collaboration that inspired the recently released documentary \u0027Pandas.\u0027After a quarter of a century of study, Kilham has no doubt that bears are as close to humans as great apes, even if as he says, apes \u0027were our closest genetic relative.\u0027He quickly realized that female bears were capable, like humans, of \u0027reciprocal altruism\u0027 -- or in other words looking after each other for the greater good.Squirty provided early proof of that. Shortly after releasing her into the wild, Kilham says another wild female false-charged him in a bid to protect Squirty, despite never having seen her before.          After a quarter of a century of study, Kilham has no doubt that bears are as close to humans as great apes, even if as he says, apes \u0027were our closest genetic relative\u0027- \u0027Reciprocal altruism\u0027 -\u0027I was like \u0027Wow, what\u0027s going on?\u0027\u0027 the 65-year-old recalls.\u0027She is unrelated! That\u0027s pure altruism!\u0027 he explains. \u0027She is taking a huge risk, encountering a human which is her greatest foe, to defend unrelated cubs from me.\u0027Since then, Squirty has shared her resources with this wild female, and shows more aggression toward her own family members than she does from this unrelated female, he says.These are parallels that many scientists are still reluctant to draw, convinced that man is more capable than animal.\u0027We are learning more and more,\u0027 says Kilham. \u0027Language is probably the one thing that has brought humans where we are.\u0027Screaming gran picks up her granddaughter and flees inside...Papa bear! Virginia State Trooper rescues two orphaned bear...Share this articleBut if language has allowed humans to develop to such an extent, Kilham also believes it has corrupted their behavior.\u0027Squirty takes in real information,\u0027 he says. Bears \u0027learn first-hand information and experience,\u0027 he says.\u0027Whereas humans, we are all over the place. The quality of information as soon as the word came out became disruptive. There is air in almost everything we read. It is especially prevalent today with the internet and fake news.\u0027Kilham says he is fascinated by the impact of language on human behavior, especially since he discovered -- at age 40 -- that he was dyslexic.- Revenge of a dyslexic -  Wildlife biologist Kilham has released 165 bears back into the wild over the past 25 yearsDyslexia lay at the heart of his difficulties at school and, for a long time prevented him from pursuing graduate studies in wildlife that he had dreamt of since childhood.He grew up surrounded by animals collected by his virologist father. He studied birds and for a while the family even kept a baby crocodile, brought back from a year in Uganda, in a shower in the basement.After working as a gunsmith, Kilham\u0027s dream took off when the department of fish and game -- tipped off to his interest by a biologist friend -- entrusted him with the first bear cubs, opening the way to the first bear rehab center in New Hampshire.Twenty-five years later, Kilham has released 165 bears back into the wild and documented more than 1,500 bear interactions in nature.His work led recently to a PhD in environmental sciences, not bad for someone not great at school, whose work has been looked down on by the scientific community.He has enjoyed quite the following nonetheless, thanks to articles in National Geographic and the popularity of his book, \u0027Among the Bears,\u0027 which came out in 2002.His commitment is to raising awareness about bears, still feared and hunted in the United States. Around 10-15 percent of New Hampshire\u0027s 5,000 to 6,000 bears are killed every year in hunting season.\u0027Bears are not interested in people. Zero,\u0027 he says. \u0027They are afraid of us.\u0027Despite advice to the contrary everywhere, people still leave food out or fail to secure chicken coops, attracting an animal that needs to fatten up before hibernation and again in early spring. In human-bear situations, the bear is always the loser.\u0027We can live very easily with bears, it\u0027s a matter of educating the public,\u0027 says Kilham. \u0027Unfortunately educating the public is like herding cats. They don\u0027t take in information very well.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/12/4B48D54A00000578-5633307-image-a-16_1524137758623.jpg","title":"NONE passengers pictured Southwest flight 1380 wearing oxygen masks correctly","story":"    Incorrect: Aviation experts have pointed out that the Soutwhest Flight 1308 passengers pictured in this image are not wearing their oxygen masks correctly.

Listen to your flight attendants! ALMOST EVERYONE in this photo from Southwest Airtoday is wearing their mask WRONG. Put down the phone, stop with the selfies.. and LISTEN. **Cover your NOSE \u0026amp MOUTH.**\u0027 Aviation experts say the masks are essential in ensuring passenger safety during aircraft emergencies.The Federal Aviation Administration calls the masks \u0027the first line of defense against the potentially lethal effects of hypoxia and carbon monoxide poisoning.\u0027 Hypoxia occurs when a person isn\u0027t getting enough oxygen, which can cause dizziness, reduced vision, impaired judgment, unconsciousness and even death. Aircraft manufacturer Airbus say if a plane loses pressure at 40,000 feet, those on board have as little as 18 seconds of \u0027useful consciousness\u0027 without supplemental oxygen.According to flight attendants, at this point the masks should drop from the cabinets overhead and they can then be activated by tugging them towards you.Passengers then need to strap the masks over both their nose and mouth before fastening the white cords behind their heads. In the picture, at least three passengers can be seen pressing the masks to their own faces and only covering their mouths.Mr. Laurie\u0027s post has now been liked and re-tweeted over 20,000 times, as several others voiced their concerns over the passengers\u0027 actions. Jennifer Riordan, 43, a mother of two, was killed on the Southwest Airlines flight from New York to Dallas on Tuesday morning - the first fatal incident in US commercial aviation for nearly a decade. The Boeing 737-700 took off without incident but minutes into the flight, passengers heard an explosion in the left engine, which sent shrapnel flying through the window, shattering the glass and leading oxygen masks to drop.     Terrifying images shot from on board show the carcass of the ruined aircraft engine which malfunctioned mid-airJennifer  was nearly drawn out of the window which was next to her seat and had to be pulled back into her seat by other passengers.After the plane made a rushed emergency landing - she was taken to hospital for emergency treatment but later died.Seven other passengers were also treated for injuries, although it is unclear as yet whether any were suffering the effects of hypoxia or carbon monoxide poisoning. Marty Martinez, 29, began filming in selfie mode in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Martinez, who runs a Dallas marketing agency, said on Wednesday he wanted to communicate with loved ones, but many social media users attacked him in expletive-laced postings. The hero captain of the plane insists she was just doing her job after safely performing an emergency landing amid the crisis unfolding on board.Tammie Jo Shults showed \u0027nerves of steel\u0027 and kept calm even as she told air traffic officials that a passenger, Jennifer Riordan, had almost been sucked out of the depressurized cabin of the Dallas-bound Boeing 737.But in a statement a day after the mid-air drama, the 56-year-old and First Officer Darren Ellisor said: \u0027We all feel we were simply doing our jobs\u0027.\u0027On behalf of the entire Crew, we appreciate the outpouring of support from the public and our coworkers as we all reflect on one family\u0027s profound loss,\u0027 the two pilots said, adding that their \u0027hearts are heavy\u0027.It comes as it emerged that Shults was once turned down by the Air Force and had even been warned at a high school careers fair that \u0027there were no professional women pilots\u0027. Instead, Mrs Shults was commissioned into the Navy in 1985 and reached the rank of lieutenant commander, said Commander Ron Flanders, the spokesman for Naval Air Forces in San Diego.Women aviators were excluded from combat missions until the month after Mrs Shults got off active duty in March 1993, but Mr Flanders said Mrs Shults flew during Operation Desert Storm trainings as an aggressor enemy pilot.           Jennifer Riordan, 43, was the only person killed on the flight after a piece of shrapnel punctured the window next to her          Tragic images show where Ms Riordan was nearly sucked out of the open window and had to be pulled back in by passengers          A piece of the engine casing discovered by startled residents at the Heidelberg Country Club in Bernville, PA, approximately 60 miles from the landing site          Officials from the FBI have been called in to help investigate the cause of the incident and could be seen helping wrap up the evidenceSouthwest Airlines passenger, 29, trolled for LIVE STREAMING emergency landing | Daily Mail Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/15/4B50E8A100000578-0-image-m-38_1524147333521.jpg","title":"Queen Prince Charles welcome heads Commonwealth Buckingham Palace","story":"Steal Sophie\u0026#39s style in a floral print dress by SuzannahWith the Duchess of Cambridge on maternity leave, we\u0026#39ve been looking to the rest of the Royal family for some style inspiration recently.

Should her wish be granted?This group of nations - from Canada to Cameroon, Australia to Antigua - is made up of countries and small islands which Britain inherited, conquered and used to advantage as we built an Empire.We used their people as slaves and cheap labour. We plundered their resources, dumped our convicts on their shores and took hundreds of years to belatedly allow them to claim independence.There’s a strong argument that- in the 21st century - the Commonwealth represents a paternalistic, outdated view of the world.The Queen tells world leaders that it is her \u0027sincere wish\u0027...Theresa May promises to introduce a ban on the sale of...Share this articleNevertheless, ever since the Queen took over as Head following the death of her father George VI, she has enchanted and beguiled the most republican of member states.Elizabeth made the Commonwealth her special project, travelling thousands of miles to visit the 53 territories and realms, and has shown huge compassion and understanding of the issues facing its disparate members.          Her majesty and the heir to the throne (pictured together) are followed out of the ballroom by the Duchess of Wales following today\u0027s Commonwealth summitNow, at 92 on Saturday, she’s anxious to step down, and gave up long-haul travel in 2013.Unlike most of the Commonwealth leaders, Elizabeth was born into immense privilege - she inherited wealth and far-flung places that have few ties to the United Kingdom.There are plenty of reasons why the Commonwealth should not work as a loose grouping of states - but amazingly, it continues to survive, providing a useful forum which draws countries together, rather than apart.Given that the British throne rules a diminishing number of Commonwealth nations - why should the next leader come from the House of Windsor?Would it not be fairer to let the Commonwealth Heads of Government hold a secret ballot and choose who should replace the Queen?The UK’s current immigration crisis - over the British subjects who arrived to work from the Caribbean as part of the ‘Windrush’ scheme, is an embarrassing disgrace during this week of Commonwealth ‘unity’.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe Windrush workers were invited to the UK to help rebuild Britain after the war, and are valued members of society. They were not shirkers, but newcomers who have enriched British culture.A blame game is going on, as politicians squabble over who is responsible for destroying the entry papers of over 50,000 Windrush immgrants, many of whom have been refused the right to work, to claim benefits and receive healthcare, and to obtain a British passport, all because the original documents showing their status cannot be found. Some have even been deported by mistake.This unfortunate cockup reveals how some white British politicians and the Establishment secretly view the Commonwealth.At the Commonwealth Games in Australia the other week, many of the British medal winners will be the grandchildren of Windrush families - we’re proud to call them British when it suits us.The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breeches.          The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breechesIn 2018, the Commonwealth can’t re-inforce the stereotype of a Regal head, someone who dishes out patronage and attends meaningless ceremonies and military events all over the world.The Commonwealth includes countries who still enforce the death penalty, who are not receptive to gay rights and who don’t think women should be allowed abortions. Navigating all that and pushing for change requires diplomacy, tact, and people skills - something which the Queen possesses in spades.To succeed her, a career politician or a charismatic leader is required. The only downside? They might not own palaces, sycophantic staff or be able to afford champagne and swanky canapes.Is Prince Charles truly the best candidate? He rarely looks at ease in these situations, his life has been spent waiting on the sidelines, being indulged and spoilt, and his relationship with his children has only recently improved.          Is Prince Charles truly the best candidate? He rarely looks at ease in these situations His relationship with his former wife was disastrous. Sensing that the handover might be tricky with some Commonwealth members, the Queen has been using her brand to reinforce the notion that the Royal family are willing to take on new challenges involving young people and sexual equality.Highly paid PR people and Private Secretaries are mounting a charm offensive to launch a second wave of junior Royals into key roles.Princess Eugenie - 8th in line to the throne and 15 other Commonwealth realms, according to her Dad’s website - turned up at a reception this week wearing a short dress and scuffed suede boots - hardly a suitable outfit for someone aspiring to ‘lead’ another democracy.Prince Harry - 5th in line to the UK throne and 15 countries - has just been appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his granny.He introduced Meghan Markle, his bride to be, to the assembled youth leaders as if they were leading a world-wide crusade for gay rights. It all sounded a bit like a rehearsal for their wedding next month.The notion that Meghan Markle will be touring the world telling other countries about human rights is patronising in the extreme.I don’t doubt for a moment that the couple are sincere and well-intentioned - but will any political leader be swayed by a woman from a TV soap?

Alfie\u0027s Army has urged people to be \u0027respectful at all times\u0027 or face being sent awayAlfie\u0027s doctors are unanimous that any treatment is \u0027futile\u0027 as the hospital caring for him urged protesters not to disturb other patients after a bouncy castle went  up outside.Alfie\u0027s parents have also urged supporters to be \u0027respectful\u0027 after people visiting Alder Hey in Liverpool complained about the noise.Men on scrambler bikes have performed noisy wheelies outside the children\u0027s hospital where Alfie  has been since December 2016, while there were also reports of protesters singing through a karaoke machine and even drinking alcohol. Yesterday the Pope intervened in the case of the British boy, appealing for his life to be shown \u0027respect\u0027 as his Vatican children\u0027s hospital offered to treat him.  Lord Justice Davis, who is heading the three-strong panel of appeal judges, told lawyers that at the start of the hearing that doctors had agreed that there was \u0027no hope\u0027.He said: \u0027We cannot have a kind of legal \u0027Groundhog Day\u0027 where you come back again and again and again on the same point.\u0027A second appeal judge, Lady Justice King, said doctors\u0027 unanimous opinion was that Alfie \u0027could not be saved\u0027.Alfie\u0027s parents were not at the appeal court hearing, which is expected to end in the next few hours.Alder Hey bosses have pleaded with Alfie Evans protesters not to disturb staff and patients with noisy demonstrations.The children\u0027s hospital urged campaigners backing Alfie\u0027s battle for survival to limit their noise due to the impact it was having on recovering patients.About 100 people were involved in a demonstration outside Alder Hey last night, with supporters chanting in support of the 23-month-old.Candles were lit in tribute and campaigners lined East Prescot Road as honking cars passed the gathered crowd.At one point they were addressed by Tom Evans from the roof of a nearby bus shelter.But photographs also show supporters brought a bouncy castle and gazebos  Alder Hey issued a statement in which it urged protesters to keep noise \u0027to a minimum\u0027.It read: \u0027We would like to make people aware of the impact the current protests are having on our patients, staff and services.\u0027Noise from recent protests has unfortunately affected our patients, so we would ask that noise levels outside the hospital are kept to a minimum. \u0027Loud and constant noise such as from car horns affects sleep and raises anxiety levels for our patients especially when recovering from procedures, so please bear them in mind.  Boys on scrambler bikes have been tearing up the road outside the hospital as part of at times noisy protests to save Alfie\u0027For visitors, we have been advised to put additional measures in place so our patients and families are able to access vital services without limitation by others.\u0027For example tomorrow, visitors may see more security in the hospital and a more controlled approach to access to certain areas.\u0027This will help us maintain a flow to vital services, so please be patient.\u0027However, Alder Hey remains fully operational with A\u0026ampE open for urgent and emergency care\u0027.The latest demonstration comes on the eve of a court hearing over Alfie\u0027s future.The case is set to be heard in the Court of Appeal this morning after an emergency order was signed by a judge on Thursday night.Just days earlier, a date and time for the withdrawal of Alfie\u0027s medical support had been set. Pope Francis used his traditional Sunday blessing in St Peter\u0027s Square to say he\u0027s praying for British brain damaged toddler Alfie Evans. The pontiff said the situation is \u0027very painful and complex\u0027 as he spoke on Alfie and others who are terminally ill.He expressed hope that they\u0027re always respected in their dignity and cared for in a way suitable to their conditions, with the agreement of family members, doctors and health workers.\u0027  Monsignor Vincenzo Paglia, head of the Pontifical Academy of Life, a Vatican bioethics think tank, said yesterday that Alfie\u0027s parents and hospital officials should work together so his life isn\u0027t \u0027reduced to a legal dispute.\u0027Francis\u0027 comments mark the second time in less than a year that he has intervened in the case of a terminally ill British child. Around 50 people were filmed standing outside Alder Hey hospital last night in protest at a judges ruling in favour of switching off the child\u0027s life support.In the footage the group sing Hero by Mariah Carey as cars and vans sound their horns in support of the tiny tot.

The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested  There could be little doubt about the prevailing view among the members as they assembled at Buckingham Palace yesterday morning for the opening ceremony of the largest Commonwealth summit in the organisation\u0027s history.It came despite reports claiming that some Commonwealth leaders remain \u0027underwhelmed\u0027 by the Prince of Wales, while senior Labour figures, including leader Jeremy Corbyn, have questioned whether he should be honoured with the role.It fell to the Maltese prime minister, as the Commonwealth\u0027s outgoing chair-in-office, to speak on behalf of his colleagues.\u0027We are elated by the vigour with which the Prince of Wales actively participates in Commonwealth affairs,\u0027 said Dr Joseph Muscat. \u0027We are certain that when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth.\u0027It remains to be seen whether the leaders decide to formalise this intention in today\u0027s end-of-summit communique. Since there is no constitutional rule about the headship, there is no requirement to do so.And although there is no vacancy yet, this was still a landmark moment. The prince has been quietly assuming more and more of the monarch\u0027s duties – investitures, overseas tours and, most recently, honouring the fallen at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday.           The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things But the Commonwealth question has always been studiously avoided. The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested.Yet having visited 44 of the 53 nations of the Commonwealth (he has been to ten in the past year alone) and having known all its leaders since birth, he probably understands \u0027the club\u0027 better than anyone alive, with the exception of his parents.Yesterday he spoke fondly of what has been \u0027a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember\u0027 and of bygone Commonwealth statesmen such as Pierre Trudeau, former prime minister of Canada, and Jomo Kenyatta, former president of Kenya. Both men\u0027s sons – Justin Trudeau and Uhuru Kenyatta – have since followed their fathers into politics. Both of them were seated on the stage yesterday with the other premiers. The Windsors are certainly not the only Commonwealth dynasty.The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things.Over nearly seven decades she has held this argumentative organisation-cum-clan together, listening to their troubles in endless private audiences, wining and dining them, breaking up fights and generally keeping the show on the road.But this was the nearest she has ever come to an instruction.Cleverly, she talked of the prince continuing her father\u0027s work as well as her own.  The Queen has told foreign dignitaries of her \u0027sincere wish\u0027 that they pick Prince Charles to take over as leader of the Commonwealth during a large summit at Buckingham Palace Commonwealth summits are unlike any other, not least because there are no interpreters. The family atmosphere was evident even before the start yesterday as the leaders gathered in the Blue Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace.Usually, royal guests in the state apartments stand around nervously, trying not to touch anything. This lot swaggered in, many giving each other bear hugs, and cheerfully plonked themselves down on priceless sofas and chairs, making themselves thoroughly at home.It is one of the reasons why the Queen has always enjoyed these summits, and why there was an added poignancy to yesterday\u0027s proceedings. For this was a farewell of sorts – not that anyone put it quite like that.The Queen, who celebrates her 92nd birthday tomorrow, no longer undertakes long-haul travel. These Commonwealth summits, held every other year, take place in Britain only every 20 years or so. The next one is scheduled for Malaysia, and the Prince of Wales will represent the Queen there.She will continue to play an active part in Commonwealth affairs and meet its leaders when they are in Britain. But her days of far-away summits are over.It explains why this gathering had attracted the largest number of premiers in Commonwealth history, with 47 heads of government present among 53 delegations.She attended her first gathering of its leaders as a princess, when her father, King George VI, created the modern organisation out of the remnants of the British Empire. There were only eight members of the Commonwealth when the Queen came to the throne.          Britain\u0027s Prince Charles greets India\u0027s Prime Narendra Modi in a receiving line for the Queen\u0027s Dinner on Thursday night In 1953, she was the dazzling debutante head surrounded by grand old stagers like Churchill, Menzies and Nehru. She would entertain the Commonwealth prime ministers on their annual trips to London until they decided to rotate these gatherings among the member nations. In 1971 the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (or CHOGM) took place in Singapore.Prime Minister Edward Heath formally advised the Queen not to attend. He warned that there would be a row over British arms sales to South Africa and that there would be a toxic atmosphere – as indeed there was. The Commonwealth came close to imploding there and then.The Queen was adamant that she would never miss another one. She has been turning up ever since, holding her audiences, her banquets and her receptions (with the exception of 2013, when the new long-haul ban ruled out a journey to Sri Lanka). All through the 1970s and 80s, all through the bust-ups over Rhodesia and South Africa, she was there in the wings, defusing the tension, raising the tone, nudging the organisation towards consensus rather than polarisation.Along the way, the Commonwealth would enjoy great triumphs – notably the end of apartheid, the return of South Africa to \u0027the club\u0027 and the creation of an independent Zimbabwe.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe fact that dozens of ex-colonies have maintained such a close bond with the once-loathed ex-imperial Crown has been, in no small part, down to the way the Queen has personally reframed that relationship.In recent years, the Commonwealth may have lost its way at a political level, eclipsed by a myriad of grander, flashier copycats – the G20, the EU and so on. Its critics suggest it is an outdated, clapped-out post-imperial has-been. But it still does its best work at the people-to-people level through numerous grass-roots associations, plugging away on tiny budgets.It has plenty of admirers and jealous rivals. The French have done their best to emulate it. There are many nations who want to join.This is a unique outfit with a unique character, forged through shared bonds of history, language, law and sacrifice. Last night\u0027s dinner was proof of that. State banquets at the Palace always have a U-shaped table with the Queen at the top. Not this one.     Last night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt Missing his Markle: Harry and William join the Queen as she...British fishing firm can appeal against a controversial...How and when will we know if Prince Charles will succeed the...King of Swaziland renames the country Kingdom of eSwatini to...Share this articleLast night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt. She sat between Dr Muscat of Malta and president Adama Barrow of The Gambia (now a Commonwealth member once more, having recently ejected the madman who used to be in charge).All the Royal Family were there, with the exception of a convalescing Prince Philip and a heavily pregnant Duchess of Cambridge. Spread all around the Picture Gallery was that old ex-imperial family to which the Queen pledged herself on her 21st birthday.By tradition, a summit newcomer had been invited to raise the toast to the Queen at the black tie banquet. President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana struck a somewhat melancholy note as he expressed \u0027our collective regret that she will no longer automatically be present at our proceedings\u0027.But he voiced a \u0027fervent hope\u0027 that \u0027her deep love for this association will continue to light the way for all of us\u0027.

One in five admit they speed for the thrill of driving so quickly.Rob Miles, director of car insurance at Direct Line said: \u0027Speeding is one of the biggest causes of accidents and casualties on UK roads. The research suggests that it is often not deliberate, as drivers may be unaware that they may are creeping above the limit. However, speed limits are set for a reason and 20mph and 30mph zones are often around schools, hospitals and other highly pedestrianised zones, where going over the limit could prove fatal in the event of an accident.\u0027The findings come amid calls from a senior police officer to get rid of the 10 per cent \u0027buffer\u0027 over the signposted limit that most police forces allow.          Millions believe there are \u0027acceptable\u0027 upper speeds they can drive at above the limitThey are typically given another 2mph allowance above this level.This leeway, which also applies to those caught on camera, is equivalent to being allowed to travel at 68mph in a 60mph zone or 35 mph in a 30mph zone.But earlier this year the chief constable of West Mercia police force Anthony Bangham said the days of the \u0027soft\u0027 treatment of offenders must come to an end.Mr Bangham, who is the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council lead on road policy, sparked a backlash from motoring campaigners and MPs for appearing to suggest that drivers should be given a ticket for travelling just 1mph over the speed limit.Mr Bangham quickly backtracked and said his comments had been misunderstood.EXCLUSIVE: Black man arrested in Starbucks was a repeat...Driver jailed for 12 years for running over pedestrian\u0027s...\u0027Ain\u0027t nobody got time for this!\u0027 911 operator is jailed for...Share this articleAnthony Bangham admitted punishing drivers for straying just one mph over the limit would not be \u0027proportionate or achievable\u0027.But speeding remains a huge problem.The equivalent of four people a minute were caught speeding in 2016, according to figures from the Home Office.In 2016 a total of 1.97 million fixed penalty notices were issued for speed limit offences across England and Wales, an extra 25,000 compared to 2015 and 107,000 compared to 2014.The most recent figures available from the Department for Transport show there were 1,792 road deaths reported in 2016 - up 4 per cent from 2015 and the highest annual total since 2011. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a0e6ba5366f636f01c505c1f2e021fe0f81332a/0_269_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=37d6ac92b65eddf4e86989a48996daeb 1240w","title":"daniel maclise palace westminster artist london","story":"Conservators unearth truth about Daniel Maclise, whose status was sullied when his murals turned murkyAlmost 150 years after he died, ending his life exhausted and depressed at apparent failure, the Irish artist Daniel Maclise has been vindicated: it was London filth, not his technique, which tarnished his reputation and the surface of his two masterpieces, the biggest paintings in the Palace of Westminster.“It is a tale of horror and disappointment,” said Malcolm Hay, curator of works of art in the palace. “The one thing I hope we can do is to turn back the clock and give poor Maclise his due.”The unveiling of the two gigantic paintings in 1865 – 100 sq metres, heaving with soldiers and sailors, guns and horses, depicting the meeting of the victorious generals Wellington and Blücher after the battle of Waterloo, and the death of Nelson at Trafalgar – should have been the greatest moment of of the artist’s life. Each had taken a year to paint and years of research. Instead his work was greeted with moans about the cost and shock that the surface of the earlier painting was turning black.A large conservation project has now started to improve on at least 30 previous attempts to make the paintings look better. Conservators are gently removing grime-infused wax and discoloured varnishes as well as the soot and dust trapped in the layers. Where the wax cannot be cleared without causing further damage, gentle warming to melt it slightly can cure the white bloom which makes the paintings even murkier.Originally the paintings were full of vivid details in red and blue. Now, on a dull day, the yellow overhead lamps help turn them sepia. Depictions of the weapons, uniform and equipment – meticulously researched by the artist, who interviewed veterans, read accounts of both campaigns, and studied relics including Wellington’s sword and the real coat Nelson was wearing when a French sniper landed the fatal shot – are all lost in the gloom. However, better lighting, experiments have proved, will also add to the dramatic difference. Maclise was the envy of every other artist in England when he won the commission to create two enormous frescoes, each costing more than £3,000, to decorate the Royal Gallery in the House of Lords when the palace was rebuilt after the fire of 1834. His full-scale drawings were a sensation at the Royal Academy, and created a buzz again in 2015 when they were exhibited for the first time in a lifetime. The Fine Arts Commission, led by Prince Albert, had insisted on the works being in fresco – seen, according to Hay, as the noblest art form. Albert sent Maclise to Germany to study the technique, which involves painting on dry plaster then spraying with a fixative. But by the time the paintings were complete Albert was dead, and the public was fed up with the endless palace work and its costs. The blackened paintings were attributed to the painter’s technique and materials, and Albert’s alien German fresco. “I think there was a very cold wind blowing on Maclise after Albert’s death,” Hay said.The conservation work, which has involved research by academics in Germany on the fresco technique, has absolved both men of blame. Despite damage from leaking windows, settlement cracks probably dating from the 19th century, and the near destruction of the gallery in the second world war when masonry from a bombed tower crashed through the roof, the frescoed plaster is still sound.“None of it was poor Maclise’s fault,” said Caroline Babington, collections care manager. “The place was still a building site and the whole city was burning coal. It wasn’t the paint turning black, it was just filthy London air.”The work will cost about £100,000 – but will also provide a condition check for the paintings before the project is dwarfed by the epic and bitterly contested restoration of the entire decaying Palace of Westminster, tentatively costed at between £3.5bn and £5.7bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a991fd62798f90eb6935fb361c442e3aa221d94/0_0_1600_1042/master/1600.jpg?w=1500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e08ca9ac8f963ace794ecfee304613dc 3000w","title":"the last town in sovietland vorkuta russia tomeu coll in pictures","story":"Up above the Arctic Circle, 40 hours by train from Moscow, sits the Russian city of Vorkuta.

But as the country’s 70th anniversary nears, the strain is showingBen-Gurion Boulevard climbs from the bustling port on Haifa’s Mediterranean shore up Mount Carmel towards the famous Bahai shrine, its gleaming golden dome surrounded by lush terraced gardens. On the south side of the palm-lined road, on a spring lunchtime, the Fattoush restaurant is packed with customers chatting noisily in Arabic and Hebrew over Levantine and fusion salads, cardamom-flavoured coffee and exquisite Palestinian knafeh desserts. “I prefer to talk of shared existence rather than coexistence,” says Yona Yahav, the veteran Jewish mayor. “Haifa’s Jews and Arabs are the same Jews and Arabs as in Jerusalem, but here things work in a stable way.” Yahav’s office is lined with portraits of his predecessors, the first two wearing Ottoman tarbooshes. The street outside bears the name of one of them, Hassan Bey Shukri. Yahav flourishes a copy of a Hebrew newspaper notice mourning Shukri’s death in 1940. “I can promise you that this won’t happen if I die,” he jokes. He is also keen to point out that his secretary, Reem, is an Arab. “I can’t tell you that all Jews love Arabs and vice versa, but people do feel safe here.” No one questions that the city is special. “If all of Israel and Palestine could be like Haifa, I’d be happy,” muses Amjad Iraqi, a twentysomething Palestinian intellectual. “It’s not lovey-dovey. Life is essentially segregated but every community accepts that you can do your own thing. It’s not perfect, but it’s still better than everywhere else.” Asaf Ron, who runs the municipally funded Beit Ha’Gefen cultural centre, argues that it is all about promoting empathy. “Many Israeli Jews don’t know any Arabs. We need to break down stereotyping and fear.”Ayman Odeh, Israel’s most prominent Arab politician, lives in the Kababir neighbourhood, with its handsome mosque and stunning views over an azure sea. He also believes his home town is different. He served on the city council before being elected to the Knesset in 2015. “The situation between Jews and Arabs has always been better in Haifa than anywhere else in Israel, but it is far from equal,” he insists. “The mood is good and there is a sense of sanity. But it is not an island.” The local HQ of Odeh’s party, the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality, is on Ben-Gurion Boulevard opposite Fattoush. It is ironic that the street is named after David Ben-Gurion, the Jewish state’s founder and first prime minister. But there are many similar examples: the Istiqlal (“Independence”) mosque is at the junction of Shavei Zion (“Returnees to Zion”) and Kibbutz Galuyot (“the Ingathering of the Exiles”) streets. Zionism Avenue snakes across the Carmel to the downtown Arab quarter of Wadi Nisnas. Identity issues will be in the air in Haifa this month and next when Israel celebrates the 70th anniversary of its independence and Palestinians mourn the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, that the 1948 war represented for them. “Arabs don’t take part in Independence Day celebrations,” says Yahav. “They don’t feel it is their holiday.” Johnny Mansour, a historian from the Greek Catholic community, will be joining a “march of return” to some of the hundreds of Arab villages destroyed after the war – the same symbolic commemoration that has triggered the recent deadly upsurge of violence on the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Fattoush, proudly flaunting its Palestinian nationalist credentials, will be closed to mark the occasion.Haifa once represented modernity and progress but feels less dynamic these days. In the twilight years of the Ottoman empire it was the terminus for a branch line of the Damascus-Hejaz railway. Allenby Street is named for the British general who freed the town in 1918, soon after the Balfour declaration backed the establishment of a “Jewish national home” in Palestine. The port opened in 1933, followed by an oil pipeline starting in Iraq. At that time, explains historian Motti Golani, half the Jewish population spoke Arabic. During the second world war, when Italian aircraft bombed the city, Jews and Arabs huddled together in basements. By 1948, the population was 70,000 Jews and 65,000 Arabs. But war changed that. In April, as fighting raged and the British prepared to leave, all but 3,000 Arabs were expelled or fled to Lebanon or the West Bank. The history of that fateful year remains bitterly contested: the Jewish mayor – unaware of military planning – urged Arab leaders to stay but they felt unable to comply with the terms for a truce. Newly arrived Jewish immigrants moved into abandoned homes in Wadi Salib. Many houses, defined as “absentee property”, are now in a state of advanced decline. The city’s flea market is held in the shadow of a crumbling Turkish bathhouse, Hammam al-Pasha. Impressive new glass and steel towers, housing the city’s courts, loom over the ruins. Haifa occupies an important place in Palestinian collective memory thanks to local luminaries such as Emile Habibi and Toufik Toubi. Habibi wrote the best-known novel by a Palestinian in Israel: The Secret Life of Saeed: The Pessoptimist. Etched on his grave are the words: “I remain in Haifa.” Acre-born Ghassan Kanafani, assassinated by the Mossad, captured the essence of the conflict in his novella Return to Haifa, in which a visiting Palestinian refugee encounters an Israeli woman who survived Auschwitz. Palmer Gate, the entrance to the port, is where Holocaust survivors came ashore and terrified Palestinians fled by boat to Acre or Beirut, mostly never to return. Haifa’s tolerance is tested at regular intervals. In October 2000, at the start of the second intifada, 13 Arab citizens were shot dead by police while demonstrating in solidarity with their kinfolk in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Yahav’s predecessor ensured the city remained calm. It was harder three years later when a woman suicide bomber from Jenin blew herself up and killed 21 others in Maxim’s restaurant – jointly owned by Jews and Arabs. In the Lebanon war of 2006, a missile fired by Hezbollah killed two elderly Arabs. Successive Israeli wars against Hamas in Gaza – in 2008-9, 2012 and again in 2014 – saw anger flare. “In Haifa, Arabs and Jews live alongside each other, but when there is tension they move apart,” argues Amjad Shbita of Sikkuy, the Association for the Advancement of Civic Equality. “Haifa’s coexistence is the best in Israel, but it can still be easily damaged.” Palestinians in Haifa and across Israel have grown closer to relatives and friends beyond the pre-1967 “green line” border with the West Bank, but their lives are very different and they have their own issues close to home. In 2013, protests erupted over a government plan to demolish the homes of“unrecognised” Bedouin communities in the Negev and build a Jewish town. Two years ago, after an unusually hot autumn, fires consumed large areas of the Carmel, triggering accusations by rightwing Jewish politicians of an “arson intifada” – though no one was ever charged. Haifa-based NGOs have their work cut out tackling discrimination in social services and budget allocations. The worst poverty is in Halissa, a mainly Arab neighbourhood where violence is blamed on rivalry between Bedouin clans and relocated collaborators from the West Bank. “The Israeli idea of coexistence is about a majority and a minority – the strong and the weak,” observes Tom Mehager of Adalah (Justice), which is devoted to securing the rights of Israel’s Arab citizens – and has vocally condemned the army’s killing of Palestinians in Gaza. “Coexistence is not equality. Speaking the same language and eating hummus together doesn’t mean Jews and Arabs are equal.” Jafar Farah, who runs the Mossawa (Equality) centre, compares the relationship between the two peoples to one between “a rider and a horse”. And that, he insists, “is how Yona Yahav deals with the Arab community in Haifa.”Education provides important insights. In Haifa, as elsewhere, Jewish and Arab children mostly attend separate schools. Many Arab children (the majority are Christians), study in fee-paying church schools, and a few dozen in Jewish ones. There are no Jews in Arab public schools, where standards are poor. The curricula are different too. “People want to stay within their own communities to speak in their native languages, have days off on their own holidays, and learn about their own history, culture and religion,” says Asaf Ron. “Assimilation through attending the other community’s schools is a free choice that almost no one chooses.” The Yad beyad (“Hand in Hand”) private network of bilingual schools complains about long waiting lists and a struggle to secure municipal support. In its kindergarten in Hadar, Arab and Jewish six-year-olds sing songs and are captivated by nursery rhymes that interchange Hebrew and Arabic – a heartwarming but highly unusual sight. “The whole country is based on separation in a very profound way,” says Merav Ben-Nun, its community organiser. Older Palestinians tend to be relaxed about this, but younger activists can be contemptuous about condescension or racism towards “colourful” natives. Many are keen to assert their growing self-confidence in the face of what they condemn as Israeli “apartheid and settler colonialism” – in the words of a strategy paper that was drawn up in the cafe Fattoush last December. The closure of Haifa’s Arab theatre, al-Midan (“The Square”), is cited as an example: state funding was withdrawn after it staged a play about a Palestinian security prisoner. The defiant response was to create an autonomous crowdfunded alternative – al-Khashabi (“The Stage”). Its Arabic-language performances are translated into English, but conspicuously not into Hebrew. “Independent Palestinian institutions do not believe in coexistence,” explains Al-Khashabi’s director, Bashar Murkus. “We believe in dialogue from a position of strength and independence.” His colleague Khoulood Tannous flatly refuses even to use the “c” word. “No one is shelling us here,” she adds. “It’s no Gaza, nor the West Bank. It’s mind games.” Politician Ayman Odeh’s disapproving view is that influence should matter more than identity to Israel’s Palestinian minority, in Haifa and beyond, and that joint struggle is the key to a more equal future. “Arabs are developing autonomy at the expense of Arab-Jewish cooperation,” warns Sikkuy’s Shbita. Neither side harbours illusions about the other. “In Haifa it’s not hate, but there’s not too much love either,” is the stark conclusion of Omer Shaffer, a Jewish Technion postgraduate who was both moved and surprised when an Arab colleague told him to “take care” when he went off to do a stint of reserve army duty at a checkpoint in the West Bank. “It’s pretty indifferent. We’ve found a way to ignore each other without killing each other.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/423063c047513fafefe978f5f2ead6c4eda3faca/0_443_4458_2675/master/4458.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ea5fb61730582349d323db2fbe6778d6 1240w","title":"political arrogance david cameron brexit","story":"It has never been difficult to distinguish between David Cameron and a humble man plagued by self-doubt.The former prime minister’s most prominent trait in power – and probably the reason he lost it – was his combination of blithe confidence with peevishness when challenged by people he judged to be his social inferiors, which covers most people. So it is not surprising to learn now, in a TV interview, that Cameron is satisfied with the decision he made to call an EU referendum (“I believe I was right”), while also believing the outcome was a bad one (“we’ve taken the wrong course”).No one likes admitting error. For public figures it can be ruinous. That is why political apologies tend to adopt the passive voice – “mistakes were made” “sorry for upset that was caused” “sorry if offence was taken”. There is nothing new in this, but it feels as if political responsibility has become especially diffuse recently. There is a culture of treating bad things that happen as acts of nature, hurricanes that formed somewhere out at sea, beyond view, and blew in without discernible cause.Theresa May, under duress, apologised for anxiety caused to the Windrush generation, whose entitlement to the security and privileges of British citizenship was callously shredded. But the prime minister is unable to articulate what, or who, caused the anxiety. Earlier this week she tried to deflect blame on to the last Labour government, as if no one would notice that her narration of the scandal omitted the operation of the Home Office between 2010 and 2016, when she was in charge of it.May’s motivation here is old-fashioned tactical evasion and partisan counter-attack, albeit not very effectively executed. But she also conveys a sincere belief in her own immunity from blame. She is not conceited in the haughty Cameron mould. She certainly doesn’t carry herself with effortless social aplomb. But her shyness must not be mistaken for modesty. She has a different kind of arrogance: a pious certainty of moral purpose that allows her to imagine her critics must be driven by motives shabbier than hers. (This, notably, is a trait she shares with the leader of the opposition.)Partly that is just a feature of a long-serving politician. A certain thickness of skin is required to survive Westminster’s vicious contact sport. And once you get into the habit of surviving criticism, it is easy to evolve the belief that none of it is justified.But there is a more profound diffusion of responsibility in British politics right now. It flows from the perversity of a government committed to a course of action that the incumbent prime minister could not bring herself to recommend to the country in a referendum. A monumental, epoch-defining thing is happening. Yet no one who believed in the idea before it became a political reality has executive control over the outcome.Boris Johnson, the highest-ranking leave campaigner in government, would rather hint that he is unhappy with the choices May is taking than demonstrate the courage required to unseat her and test different choices in practice. The foreign secretary embodies a common desire to enjoy the status of an office without the responsibility contained in that office. He wanted his ambition to be inflated by the spirit of Brexit, but not to own the consequences of Brexit.Johnson was not in Cameron’s cabinet, but the model of being pro-leave in government, without having to explain how a government might safely go about leaving, was pioneered by the former prime minister. He was so confident of winning the referendum that he allowed Tory Brexiteers to campaign against him without surrendering the security of their ministerial berths. He suspended cabinet responsibility, allowing colleagues to serve the government in the morning, criticise government policy in the afternoon, and join rallies with the government’s sworn enemies in the evening.Brexiteers have subsequently been accused of wanting to have their cake and eat it. But for years Cameron indulged radical Euroscepticism as if it were a manageable eccentricity or cultural foible, wholly compatible with the demands of responsible government. He ran the magic cake shop for Tory politicians.He did this because he worried about splitting the party and imagined that was the likelier hazard than Britain actually leaving the European Union. When it turned out he was wrong, he shrugged and left the stage, humming a little tune, with the jaunty gait of a man who has never had to clear up his own mess whose tables have always been laid before he arrives and cleared by the staff after he leaves.And now, nearly two years later, he tells us he thinks he made the right choices. Former prime ministers aren’t generally in the business of trashing their own legacies and, since the Brexit plebiscite is certain to be Cameron’s biggest contribution to the history books, he doesn’t have much incentive to think of it as a monumental blunder. Also, his position is logically consistent. A democrat can be glad that the nation was consulted and accept, with a heavy heart, a disappointing verdict.But Cameron’s heart doesn’t sound heavy. His manner is as breezy as ever. He seems to consider two notions – that the referendum was a good idea and that Brexit is a bad idea – as distinct entities in time and space and not part of a political sequence defined by actions for which he had responsibility.He doesn’t have to be sorry that the referendum was held. But he might, as a courtesy to those who agree with his verdict on the result and who now live with the consequences, sound a bit sorry that he failed to win the argument that he gambled with other people’s money and jobs, miscalculated the odds and blew it. He may not have wanted Brexit, but he still has to own it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54dc94c75de27f17fd646f26671219931083411/0_0_1365_819/master/1365.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=707b8aaecedf88533c69ef587eb319ff 1240w","title":"the guardian view on stephen lawrence we owe his parents better","story":"It is 25 years since a tragedy and crime evolved into a national scandal. Two of the five original suspects in the racist murder of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence were jailed almost two decades later, following advances in forensic science, but Scotland Yard says it has no further leads. The time it took to secure those convictions, and the fact that some of his killers remain free, is directly related to the second outrage that followed Stephen’s murder: the appalling failure of police to bring those responsible to account, and their shocking treatment of his family and his friend Duwayne Brooks, with him that terrible night, which extended even to spying on them. Only the extraordinary determination of Stephen’s parents, Doreen and Neville, confronted the wider public with the reality of racism both on the streets and within the state, and brought to light officers’ bias, sheer incompetence and alleged links to criminals. (The Guardian today reports fresh claims about those connections.) In 1999, the resulting Macpherson report exposed the institutional racism of police and forced a broader reckoning.The powerful BBC documentary series Stephen: the Murder that Changed a Nation captures these events in full. But it also shows how limited and slow progress has been. Lady Lawrence has repeatedly warned that racism still blights Britain, with discrimination persisting not only in the justice system but also education, housing and employment. This week the family’s solicitor, Imran Khan, revealed their shock on hearing an officer who had won their confidence dismiss the notion that the Metropolitan police as a whole was racist as “utter rubbish” and call Lady Lawrence ungrateful. “You cannot help but think that the improvements we so wanted to see were only skin deep,” Mr Khan wrote.Racism is not about the behaviour of an inidual but structures, he noted: the institutions and society that frame, shape and respond to it. Discussing how the 50-year-old “rivers of blood” speech by Enoch Powell – admired by members of the gang that killed Stephen – legitimised physical attacks, he added: “It\u0026nbspis politicians who set the parameters of how society behaves. It immediately filtered down.”The Macpherson report initially made public figures more careful in addressing race, and compelled institutions to face their shortcomings. Leaders had to decide whether they would tackle the worst instincts of society head-on, tolerate them as inevitable – or pander to them. As home secretary, Theresa May in some regards took up that challenge and showed a courage that predecessors lacked: calling police “too white”, criticising their use of stop and search, and meeting with the relatives of people who had died in custody.But on immigration, political rhetoric has since turned for the worse. And immigration is inextricably connected to race relations the rise in hate crimes after the Brexit vote hit not only European migrants but also British-born black and Asian citizens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8892c5ba09b6c41822ce3e68ebca8f6ff2e91faf/0_73_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c21f9c583bd4565935b6621adc11ffa8 1240w","title":"the guardian view on the imf practise what you preach","story":"It is now 10 years since the global economy was convulsed by the most serious crisis since the 1930s, and there is a sense of deja vu as finance ministers and central bank governors gather in Washington for this week’s spring meeting of the International\u0026nbspMonetary\u0026nbspFund. As was the case before 2008, growth looks brittle. Debt\u0026nbsplevels in the west, according to the IMF’s latest fiscal monitor, have not been higher than they are today since the second world war. In emerging markets, they are at levels typically associated with the sort of problems that befell Latin America in the 1980s.In another echo of a decade ago, the US is once again becoming the global consumer of last resort. The\u0026nbspgeneralised upswing in the global economy is in no small part due to the world’s biggest economy sucking in imports. Global imbalances between countries running surpluses and those running deficits – a warning sign of trouble ahead in the mid-2000s – are back. Donald\u0026nbspTrump’s fiscal policy is certain to make the global imbalances worse. The IMF thinks the extra demand stimulated by the president’s package of tax cuts and extra spending will suck in imports and boost an already high US current account deficit by $150bn in 2019.In some respects, though, the world today is more troubled than it was in 2008. For a start, in Mr Trump the US has a president willing to risk a trade war to force creditor nations such as China and Germany to reduce the size of their current account surpluses. What’s more, the public in the west now has a much more jaundiced view of globalisation in general and free\u0026nbsptrade in particular following a decade of flatlining wages and stagnant living standards. Mr\u0026nbspTrump’s “America\u0026nbspfirst” message has struck a chord with many American voters just as “take back control” resonated with many UK voters during the EU\u0026nbspreferendum.But the chances are that the Fed will start to get trigger-happy, not least because Mr Trump has no intention of heeding the IMF’s advice that he should be reducing the US budget deficit rather than increasing it through ill-timed tax cuts. Relations between the White House and the IMF are currently worse than they have been since Franklin Roosevelt’s officials shaped the new multilateral economic institutions in the latter days of the second world war. Indeed, the prospect is that Mr Trump will become still more protectionist as the US current account widens over the coming months. The risks of a trade\u0026nbspwar are very real.Three things would help avert trouble. Firstly, surplus countries could defuse trade tensions with pro-growth policies that lead to higher imports. Secondly, central banks should err on the side of caution when it comes to raising interest rates. Finally, as the IMF notes, growth should be made more inclusive. Given\u0026nbspthe Fund’s own role in putting together anti-poor rescue plans for countries such as Greece, that’s a lesson it needs to learn itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a9f2eeb329a9f7130978f5b21d7353c357aa1e2/0_0_640_388/master/640.jpg?w=940\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=742cc34145217726e8eff31ed1b8c24e 940w","title":"kendrick pulitzer black artists excellence beyonce grammys creativity equality","story":"This week the unparalleled contributions of black performers were finally recognised by the establishment. Why has it taken so long?Did she just say … Kendrick Lamar? The satisfied little smile on Pulitzer prize administrator Dana Canedy’s face as she announced the final award of the afternoon confirmed what I thought I surely had misheard. In awarding the first Pulitzer for a hip-hop album and artist, the music jury, which included the jazz violinist Regina Carter and Columbia professor Farah Jasmine Griffin, cited Lamar’s “vernacular authenticity” and “affecting vignettes … on African-American life”. In other words, the boy can rap.It has been an abundant week for black excellence: Black Panther was certified the third highest-grossing film in US box-office history Beyoncé delivered a jaw-dropping performance at Coachella and yes, Kendrick Lamar won a Pulitzer prize. We seem to be having a moment. But is it a moment of increased creativity, or just increased recognition for what we’ve been doing all along?The surprise of Lamar’s win comes, in part, from the fact that the Pulitzers don’t announce finalists ahead of time. But there’s also, obviously, another element: no one expects a young black rapper to win one of the fanciest prizes in the land. Despite the fact that black Americans have long been at the vanguard of popular music and culture – evidenced, in part, by hip-hop overtaking rock this year to officially become the top-selling musical genre – there is still a gaping chasm between black artists’ creative achievements and how that work is acknowledged by the white mainstream.Beyoncé’s riveting performance at Coachella last weekend is just one example. With her all-black marching band and string section, Formation-infused rendition of James Weldon Johnson’s “black national anthem” Lift Every Voice and Sing, and tireless vocals and choreography, she gave us a loving salute to historically black college culture that was not only artistically impressive, but a technical feat, with abundant pyrotechnics, a giant bleacher-style set, dozens of musicians and dancers in constant, meticulous motion, and top-level live video editing that is tough to get in a single take.But she was also the first woman of colour to headline the festival in its 20-year history. She is the most beloved artist on the face of the planet, but had to watch Adele, a huge Beyoncé fan, reluctantly accept the 2017 Grammy for Album of the Year over her. In previous years, Beyoncé lost that award to Beck and to Taylor Swift.There’s a reason Kanye West ran up to a different award stage, at the Video Music awards in 2009, to snatch the microphone from Taylor Swift to deem Beyoncé’s Single Ladies “one of the best videos of all time”– because mainstream institutions rarely give black artists their due. You can hold your breath waiting on that recognition or you can take matters – and mics – into your own hands.This reality harks back to what so many black children are taught by our parents: that we have to “work twice as hard to earn half as much”. That to succeed, compromises and considerations have to be made. Tina Knowles, in hearing her daughter’s idea for a Coachella show with an HBCU (historically black colleges and universities) theme for a mostly white audience, thought perhaps it would go over their heads. (And it did.) Beyoncé’s response? “At this point in my life and my career, I have a responsibility to do what’s best for the world and not what is most popular.”If you know you might not ever get a top award for your work, perhaps that allows you the creative licence to do whatever you want. For Beyoncé, whose racial politics did not discernibly enter her work until Lemonade (2016), that has meant celebrating the Black Panthers at the Super Bowl and talking about police brutality in the Formation video. At Coachella, it meant creating her own sorority, “Beta Delta Kappa”, complete with step show and an initiation – for a “historically Beyoncé college or university”. As someone who attended an HBCU, it felt so good, so special, to be directly spoken to like that. Beyoncé said she hoped young people of all races would feel inspired to further research the references made in her performance. But she didn’t make that beautiful performance for everybody. She made it for us.The same goes for Lamar and Damn. It’s an album that is explicitly political, openly black and undeniably good. His Pulitzer resonates, in part, because it’s a deviation from the norm of overlooking black artists for their unparalleled contributions to culture.It is also a major institution’s belated acknowledgment of a genre that has been award-worthy for decades. For the Pulitzers, Grammys and others, the first person of colour to do something often happens long after the founding of the organisation. Though it’s exciting to see Lamar, Beyoncé, Ava DuVernay, Tiffany Haddish and Donald Glover be so publicly lauded, it does raise the question: why did it take so long?Every year that black people and other marginalised groups get shut out from big awards (which could be every year), there are two reactions: the demand for inclusion, and the demand to “create our own awards”. There are those who seek the legitimising kiss of an Academy and there are those who know it’s not by us, or for us.The Pulitzer board’s “special citations”, which are only occasionally given, illustrate a telling pattern: Duke Ellington, John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk were only honoured long after their deaths Alex Haley was cited for Roots in 1977 when he just as easily could have won for The Autobiography of Malcolm X. It reminds me of Spike Lee’s “special” Oscar awarded in 2015 it smacks of a consolation prize.With someone as culturally invested as Lamar, it’s important to remember that a Pulitzer does not legitimate him, his work, or his art form. Though it be middle-aged, with a Harvard archive and research institute specialising in it, hip-hop has never needed formal recognition of its merits.And for black artists, who so often get passed over for recognition, many times in favour of non-black artists doing approximately the same thing (see: Macklemore beating Lamar for best rap album at the 2014 Grammys), that distinction – a guest at the table, or seated at the head – might mean the difference between the freedom to create, and the hope that one day, that kiss will be for you.It’s wonderful to see them celebrated and deified but Kendrick, Beyoncé, Lena Waithe, Jordan Peele, Cardi B, and so many more were creating works we love long before the establishment paid attention. In other words, if a black artist does her work in the woods and the white mainstream isn’t there to see it, doesn’t she still slay?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/016d49cdfa10dce9c78b65789987ee2e98681b13/0_160_1676_1005/master/1676.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dea916d0fdb58f0303fc69469dfe68ec 1240w","title":"javier bardem defends woody allen i am very shocked by this treatment","story":"The actor, who worked with Allen on Vicky Cristina Barcelona, has defended him after other stars have decided to distance themselves• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayJavier Bardem has come to the defense of Woody Allen in response to other actors distancing themselves from the film-maker.The Oscar-winning actor, who worked with Allen on 2008’s Vicky Cristina Barcelona, has said in a new interview that he is “absolutely not” ashamed of starring in the film.“If there was evidence that Woody Allen was guilty, then yes, I would have stopped working with him, but I have doubts,” he said in an interview with Paris Match.After resurfaced allegations of sexual abuse made by Allen’s daughter Dylan Farrow, a host of actors have spoken out about working with the film-maker. Stars including Ellen Page, Michael Caine and Greta Gerwig all said they would never work with him again.“I am very shocked by this sudden treatment,” Bardem said. “Judgments in the states of New York and Connecticut found him innocent. The legal situation today is the same as in 2007.” In fact no charges were filed after Farrow accused him of molesting her when she was a child, something that Allen denies. Despite a state’s attorney saying he had “probable cause” to prosecute, Allen was never put on trial, a move intended to spare Dylan Farrow the trauma of a court appearance, the prosecutor said.An op-ed from Dylan Farrow in December, criticizing the hypocrisy of actors for keeping quiet over the alleged abuse from her father, led to more speaking out. “I can only speak for myself and what I’ve come to is this: if I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film,” Gerwig said in a roundtable discussion for the New York Times. “I have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again.”Allen’s next film, A Rainy Day in New York, is still awaiting release. Two of its stars, Rebecca Hall and Timothée Chalamet, have already donated their salaries to charity. “I want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all the people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve,” wrote Chalamet in an Instagram post.Bardem’s response arrives after Alec Baldwin also made his defense of the director clear. “Woody Allen was investigated forensically by two states (NY and CT) and no charges were filed,” Baldwin tweeted. “The renunciation of him and his work, no doubt, has some purpose. But it’s unfair and sad to me. I worked w WA 3 times and it was one of the privileges of my career.”Diane Keaton has also continued to support the film-maker. “Woody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe him,” she tweeted in January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8081884f0f972674ad05ef3280d7ac70fbb63f4a/0_104_3133_1880/master/3133.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8c9904322916cfcd47a77cf67261cd63 1240w","title":"burnley chelsea premier league match report","story":"Antonio Conte identified desire, commitment and sacrifice as key ingredients in Chelsea winning back-to-back league games for the first time since December. It will console Álvaro Morata to know the Chelsea manager thought he embodied them all. Morata misses were the only blot on an otherwise encouraging night for Conte’s team at Burnley as they preserved faint hopes of Champions League qualification.Chelsea’s £58m record signing cut a furious figure when substituted shortly after squandering a glorious opportunity to seal the 65th win of Conte’s 100-game reign. The Spain international exchanged words with a mocking Burnley crowd behind the dug-out and threw away his boots in disgust before receiving a consoling pat from Cesc Fàbregas. Victor Moses’ 70th minute winner ensured Morata’s miss did not matter and, while it may hinder his chances of starting Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final against Southampton, the striker’s overall contribution alongside Olivier Giroud was ample consolation to Conte.“I think Álvaro must be angry because when you have a chance to score, especially for a striker, it can change your confidence,” the Chelsea manager said. “I think he was angry with himself for the chance he missed but I saw a very good performance. I am happy I tried two strikers. They played very well. To see Giroud and Morata play this way “there was a good combination and a desire to press. This could be an option for Sunday and maybe the future. It can be a good option when players show you this desire and sacrifice themselves without the ball for the team.”The FA Cup may have assumed greater importance than Conte dared imagine back in August but he and his players are not giving up on a top-four finish lightly. They are five points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham with four matches to play but their superiority over a Burnley side that had not lost at Turf Moor since 20 January, and had the opportunity to leapfrog Arsenal in sixth following five consecutive league wins, should restore belief beyond Wembley. Conte made six changes to the side that defeated Southampton in the league last weekend. He changed Chelsea’s formation too, opting for Giroud and Morata at the head of a 3-5-2 with Pedro in central midfield, but there was no evidence of disruption as the visitors gave a commanding display.Conte said: “It won’t be easy because it is five points to Tottenham but the only thing we can do is try to get three points in every game from now until the end.”Giroud and Morata established an immediate rapport, combining instinctively and giving the Burnley defence no respite in possession all night. The former Arsenal striker released his partner with a neat flick over James Tarkowski. Morata’s run took him wide but his low shot was goal-bound only to strike goalkeeper Nick Pope’s legs and deflect wide.The England World Cup hopeful was not so fortunate from Chelsea’s next attack. Moses was the instigator with a driving run that caught Stephen Ward unawares, although credit is due to Gary Cahill for the perfectly-timed delivery that dropped at the feet of the right wing-back. Moses pulled his cross back from the byline towards Giroud. Pope’s fingertips got there first, but only succeeded in steering the ball against the arm and thigh of Long before it dropped slowly, agonisingly, over the line.Burnley responded strongly with Ashley Barnes a constant menace but it was Chelsea who came closest to extending their lead before the interval. Giroud sent Morata through on goal for a second time only for Pope to deny the former Real Madrid and Juventus striker his 15th goal of the season.Conte had no complaints with Morata’s work rate or the pace that frequently stretched Burnley. His finishing was a different matter, however, and there was no clearer illustration of his lack of composure when sent clear for a third time. Kanté was the provider, intercepting Matthew Lowton’s attempted pass and releasing Morata from inside the Chelsea half. The striker galloped through and his options appeared to improve when Pope stayed on his six-yard line. Morata lined up his shot but, to widespread disbelief among the away fans, failed to hit the target. It would be his last contribution before being replaced by Eden Hazard, who brought a calm assurance to the closing stages.Morata’s miss assumed greater significance when Burnley levelled courtesy of a wild deflection off Barnes’ heel. Johann Berg Gudmundsson tried his luck from distance and it paid idends when his shot struck his team-mate and sailed into the far corner with Courtois stranded. Chelsea players converged on the referee to protest that Barnes was offside. He was level with Cahill when the ball was struck and Burnley were back in the game. But not for long.Emerson produced an impressive display on the left for Chelsea and it was his searching cross that produced the winner for Moses. Giroud was unable to connect with another of his scorpion kicks and the delivery dropped invitingly for the unmarked wing-back at the back post. Moses drilled a low shot past Pope for a deserved, hard-fought away win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8339a666bdeec2d8eb65868d0ae33335e2e7f40f/255_59_1678_1006/master/1678.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b24acfbf83f6083d457ff80d1b051cbe 1240w","title":"liverpool success coutinho klopp genius","story":"I have heard Jürgen Klopp cite inspirations as varied as heavy metal music and Rocky Balboa so\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspwouldn’t be surprised if the Liverpool manager\u0026nbspwas also familiar with Aristotle. After all, Klopp showed in January that his football philosophy is very much in line with the great Greek thinker who believed that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”.Klopp shocked many in the football world when almost four months ago he sanctioned the sale of his most technically gifted player, Philippe Coutinho, who had been outstanding in the first half of the season and did not replace him like for like, causing supporters and pundits to question everything from his judgment to his sanity. Instead he recruited a centre-back in Virgil van Dijk and trusted his instinct that the team would improve as a consequence.If you reflect on some of the commentary and analysis\u0026nbspof Liverpool at the end of the January transfer window you would assume that their performances would tail off without the genius and creativity of Coutinho and that they could not possibly withstand the loss of a world-class player.Instead fast forward to mid‑April and I cannot remember a time when Liverpool have been in such a strong position and fans so hopeful in the short and long term to fight for the top trophies at home and in Europe.The narrative which Klopp has superbly orchestrated is a story about the victory of team functionality, philosophy and identity where the importance of team chemistry, understanding of inidual roles within a system and collectivism is evident. This is vital in a sport where increasingly more importance is placed on the inidual superstar and the size of transfer fees and wages that come with that kind of player.What Liverpool have achieved this season, especially since Coutinho moved to Barcelona and they acquired Van\u0026nbspDijk, should be lauded and studied by fans, pundits and aspiring coaches such as me in understanding that success can be built even while losing top inidual attacking players if you have a fundamental style of play that enables a team to outweigh the sum of its parts and produce not just winning football but get supporters of all allegiances off their seats every time they play.Klopp has shown that you can improve a side while selling your best player if you cater to the needs of your most productive players in the way that you play and it is no coincidence that the signing of Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain has tactically enabled the likes of Sadio Mané, Roberto Firmino and the outstanding Mo\u0026nbspSalah to be even more of a threat.Oxlade-Chamberlain, while a gifted footballer, does not have the technical ability of Coutinho but what he does bring is an athletic dynamism and power that Coutinho doesn’t possess and an extreme intensity which creates a platform for Liverpool’s lightning transitions where the likes of Mané and Salah cause havoc. It was evident in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City where in that first half their pressing, counterpressing and attacking transitions were incredible and I question whether, if Coutinho had been playing instead of Oxlade-Chamberlain, Liverpool would have been quite as dynamic, intense and productive.Also, in addressing their need for a top centre-half Liverpool now possess an added defensive steel, giving their outstanding front three the opportunity and foundation to score and create goals. I also look at the fundamental way Klopp sets out his teams and the way that iniduals within his system have improved because they know what is expected of them.Andrew Robertson, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mané,\u0026nbspSalah, Firmino and even a veteran in James\u0026nbspMilner\u0026nbspare raising their game week after week and have\u0026nbspplayed an integral part in implementing the principles of Klopp’s coaching while justifying the faith he places not on reputation or transfer fee but the performances of those he trusts.It all comes down to team functionality and forward planning, and this can be achieved only with a top manager who understands and is faithful to his style of play regardless of the inevitable criticism he faces when times get tough. Pep Guardiola and Klopp have been criticised in this country for sticking to their football principles when results have not been up to scratch but this comes with the territory and is understandable, while the bigger picture shows that recruitment and improving the players on an inidual level increases their monetary value and gives the football club a vision and plan for the longer term.Selling Coutinho for almost £150m is a great example of this. He has been replaced in the team by a relatively young player in Oxlade-Chamberlain, who possesses a completely different football profile but fits perfectly into the team’s philosophy at a fraction of the price and has improved the team’s functionality and chemistry overall.This is managerial genius and it not only keeps the fans happy but also the directors and shareholders who are always checking the club spreadsheets!This Liverpool journey has only just begun and I am excited to see where it ends both this season and in years to come – but it is also a story of how we need to see the whole picture, as fans, coaches and in the media, that matches are rarely won by one superstar but by the collaboration and collectivism of 11 players committed to the functionality of the team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f69233fcc7a667a4cbe78bcb8dfbf1718052e1fb/0_165_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9b7848e42b8087c3cd97dc2bddab2c2d 1240w","title":"mousa dembele stuttering striker complete midfielder fa cup tottenham","story":"Never mind that his name is a mystery. A\u0026nbspplayer who, at the age of 30, is improving to the point where one of his former managers describes him as the best midfielder in the world and Mauricio Pochettino has ranked him alongside Diego Maradona and Ronaldinho deserves to be remembered.But how? As Moussa Dembélé, which was how he was known from birth until a couple of years ago? Or as Mousa Dembélé, as everybody writes his name now? Mousa (let’s go with the latest version) had been coy about it. “It’s a long story,” he told a Belgian journalist before Euro 2016. Then he revealed in a Belgian magazine it was in fact a short, simple one. When he extended his passport his name was put down with one ‘s’ by accident. Dembélé said he decided to keep it that way.There is another Moussa Dembélé in international football, a Frenchman, nine years younger, who plays for Celtic and who quality-wise does not come close. People who know the Belgian Dembélé say it is typical of him to keep a bit of mystery, to not always want to come across as the nice, balanced guy he is. They also say it was probably out of kindness to his namesake that he did not take any action.One certainty as Dembélé prepares to play for Tottenham against Manchester United in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final is that he is the complete midfielder. One team-mate describes him as a ballerina, another as a tank, but they all think he is the best player in this Spurs side.When Dembélé came to England in 2010, signed by Fulham, he was a striker now he is a midfielder, albeit one hard to categorise. He is not a typical playmaker, nor a holding midfielder or box-to-box-player. He is not merely a Zola-esque technician or a pure Keane-esque tackler he is all this combined and more.Dembélé the person is just as multifaceted. “Sometimes I think: ‘Am I crazy?’” he told the Belgian writer Raf Willems for his book Sympathy for the Devils about Belgian players in the Premier League. “I like African music but also R\u0026ampB, rap, alternative rock and classic. Put down Chinese instrumental, ballet, lounge and Malian kora as well.”As the child of a mother from the small Belgian town of Mol and a father from Mali and the streets of multicultural Antwerp, he understands different cultures. “I can empathise with different cultural expressions and am open to things that seem strange at first sight. I notice I have both African and Belgian characteristics.”And English. Rather than watching football on television he goes to West End musicals, or at least he did until he became a father.He was never one for trouble. His mother could let him play on the street and go to the gym to play football because he would be home for dinner without being asked. She motivated him to develop his skills by taping the light switch so he could turn it off and on by kicking a ball at it. The damage did not bother her. “I’m not the materialistic kind,” she has said.His parents watched all his games from Berchem Sport to Spurs, alongside Dembélé’s grandmother, who played football in Belgium but developed multiple sclerosis aged 40. Young Mousa and she were close.Dembélé made unorthodox choices. Rather than joining Anderlecht, Belgium’s biggest club with an excellent youth system, who were desperate to sign him, he went to a smaller Dutch club, Willem II, because he loved the country’s adventurous, technical football. His coach there, Robert Maaskant, was impressed by the 17-year-old’s physique: “Some of my experienced, strong defenders thought they had bumped into a tree instead of a teenager.”At his next club, AZ, Dembélé did not score freely, despite having top tutors in Louis van Gaal (coach), Shota Arveladze (fellow striker then mentor) and Patrick Kluivert (trainee coach). But he made a big impact and helped AZ to an unexpected title in 2009. The goals he did score were mostly high quality. A dashing solo effort against Willem II has a prominent place in the virtual museum for the Dutch top flight’s most beautiful goals.At AZ Dembélé became aware of the importance of scoring more. “But I will never become a real killer,” he has said. He may be too nice. With Belgium he has not been a regular for a long time and did not start their last friendly, despite his strong form. He accepts it practically without mention and seems more upset when Radja Nainggolan, with whom he is competing for a place, is criticised. Fitness problems do not help his case.“He does not beat players with speed but almost walks by them,” Maaskant says. “Then you can get a kick. He’s so tough, he didn’t really mind, just played on. Only afterwards we saw how thick his ankles were.”Strength is key to his game. “You can always count on him but he has been giving so much for 13 years,” says Martin Jol, who managed him at Fulham and regards him as the world’s finest midfielder. “Sometimes I thought of resting him but even the idea of starting without him made me sweat.”Jol gave Dembélé a permanent role in central midfield at Fulham, after Van Gaal tried him as a right midfielder. “In England, a striker has to score,” Jol says. “I wanted to take away that pressure. The stupid thing is, at training he banged balls in the top corner without a care. In midfield he was sensational, the one with the ideas, the passing ability but also the best ball winner.“There is hardly a midfielder who can and dares to beat opponents in midfield like he does. Maybe Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal but Mous can do it better, smoother.”The comparisons Pochettino reached for were even more striking. “I think it was a joke,” Dembélé has said. “I’m not a Maradona and it’s not my intention to become one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45d6f5db979873710d3be7a1d3df4c95ec82db0/0_42_4461_2677/master/4461.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b478c9142555650296540e3f8e285a0f 1240w","title":"sam allardyce fan survey give myself 11","story":"Sam Allardyce believes Everton could alleviate pressure on his position by clarifying whether he remains the man for the long term at Goodison Park.Allardyce received fierce criticism from Everton fans during the 1-1 draw at Swansea and was inadvertently caught up in a PR fiasco this week when a club survey invited season-ticket holders and members to rate his performance on a scale of zero to 10.The manager has received a personal apology from the chairman, Bill Kenwright, over the latest embarrassment in Everton’s season which the manager has blamed on the club’s director of marketing and communications, Richard Kenyon.The manager remains under contract at Goodison until next summer. But with the club linked with yet another managerial change at the end of the season he believes Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s major shareholder, or one of his officials could help his predicament by stating he retains their support.“It’s not healthy for me,” Allardyce said. “Not by any stretch of the imagination is it healthy for me. It only adds more pressure on but I have to accept that in my position. I have to have a skin like a rhino. And I have a skin like a rhino, so I can move on. I don’t bear any malice towards the marketing director. But, you know, it was extremely unfortunate for me, particularly that this survey came out. It’s quite strange it came out last year but never got picked up in the media. But it got picked up this time and with the rumours that are rumbling around at the minute, I’m not surprised.”“If there is no clarity then you have to speculate on that. I wouldn’t disagree with that. It builds the pressure, I agree with you but I’m not the boss. I’m the boss of the team and I make the football decisions with the rest of the staff but only the other boys can decide if or when they want to come out and say what they want to say.”Allardyce addressed the survey episode head-on at a press conference on Thursday, calling it a “big mistake” and claiming: “Our director of marketing is not a great understander of football.” Asked whether he had received an apology from Kenwright, he said: “Off the chairman, yes. And don’t ask me how many marks I’d get out of 10, either.” That invited the inevitable follow‑up question to which Allardyce replied, laughing: “Piss off. Eleven!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51577d61fc0d060332998db522443a0390d20f51/0_193_4850_2910/master/4850.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0cd241b628e96c0b7ac1f1138bfa377f 1240w","title":"steven pienaar football welcomes amnesty international","story":"• Former Everton midfielder now an ambassador for the club• Scheme is intended to help refugees settle in the countrySteven Pienaar retired from football at the start of March but that did not stop him from lacing up his boots again last week. Like the final days of his illustrious career, however, it did not quite go exactly to plan. “I actually joined in for a bit of five-a-side,” he says. “It was OK – the kids were happy because I lost twice but maybe tomorrow we can get some revenge.”The South African, who made more than 200 appearances for Everton in two spells, was back on Merseyside in his new role as club ambassador to take part in a weekly coaching session for refugees and asylum seekers. Part of Everton in the Community’s efforts to provide support for some of Liverpool’s most deprived people, Pienaar knows all about battling against the odds.Born in the township of Westbury in Johannesburg during the apartheid years, the 36-year-old’s career took him to Ajax as a teenager and also encompassed spells with Borussia Dortmund, Tottenham and Sunderland.Now, with a record number of 60 clubs from across the country set to take part in Amnesty UK’s second Football Welcomes initiative this weekend after the success of last year’s inaugural event, Pienaar is hoping schemes like Everton’s can continue to improve the assimilation\u0026nbspprocess.“We are working with kids from different parts of the world and trying to give them an opportunity to learn English,” he says. “Football is a special sport which brings people together – whatever problems you are having in your life they all seem to go away when you get on to the pitch. I was born in apartheid South Africa and I know how sport, including football, can help to bring people together and break down barriers. I’ve been in that situation and I’ve always wanted to get involved with the community.”Started in 2015, it is estimated 140 young people from 25 countries including Eritrea, Iraq, Sudan and Somalia have already benefited from Everton’s community project. Similar initiatives such as Middlesbrough’s Club Together scheme have sprung up around the country as Britain’s football clubs attempt to help ease the transition to a new country.On Saturday, 12 Premier League clubs including Arsenal, Everton, Tottenham, Crystal Palace and West Ham will be among those showing their support and solidarity with refugees through a variety of activities and events.“It’s wonderful to see even more clubs laying aside their rivalries this weekend and coming together to say refugees are welcome here,” says Naomi Westland, Amnesty UK’s Football Welcomes manager. “At a time when politics is often dominated by hate-filled and isive rhetoric, this shows that there is another story to be told. Football clubs are at the heart of their communities and have a vital role to play in helping people who have fled conflict and persecution settle in to a new country and culture.”Arsenal’s Granit Xhaka, Victor Moses of Chelsea, Stoke’s Xherdan Shaqiri and Manchester City women’s striker Nadia Nadim are among a number of players currently employed by English clubs who were once refugees. They are following in the footsteps of six children who escaped the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s who became professionals, including Norwich’s Antonio and José Gallego. More than 80 years on, the Championship club is hosting Norfolk Welcomes – Football Welcomes, with children from 61 local schools sending questions to the club’s Bosnia and Herzegovina international Mario Vrancic, whose family escaped the Balkan war in the 1990s. “It was clear the war in Bosnia was coming and we had to leave to find safety,” he recalled this week. “My entire family went to different countries. The hardest thing was leaving my grandparents behind and trying to start a new life in a new country.”A number of other initiatives down the football pyramid will also be taking place, including tournaments run by refugee teams in Chichester, Plymouth, Manchester and Leeds, with Women’s Super League sides Durham, Reading, Sunderland and Tottenham all offering free tickets for their matches.Pienaar, who played just four matches for Bidvest Wits in his homeland before being forced to retire due to mounting injury problems, now plans to move into coaching after this summer’s World Cup. He is grateful to be a part of Everton’s community work after not having the chance to bid farewell when he left the club in 2016. “In my last season I was fighting with a lot of injuries and I knew my contract was coming to an end,” he says. “I just wanted to go out on the field just to say goodbye. I was disappointed but it’s in the past and we just have to move on. To get the chance to come back and do something like this with Everton is fantastic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e41cd337184577de9bf0c346cc2b4b5f56ac1a5/0_556_4640_2784/master/4640.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f820f2c13c69c6f48ae241ef7724fab0 2600w","title":"scavenging grime sewage gold mumbai streets india","story":"Along the narrow alleys of one of India’s largest bullion markets, men and women scrape a living scouring the dust and even the drains for specks of the precious metal When most of Mumbai is fast asleep at 5am each day, 41-year-old Tanu Behre sets out on her hunt.Armed with a little handbrush, she walks the narrow alleys of Zaveri bazaar, one of India’s largest bullion markets, and dusts the streets for gold. She enters drains outside goldsmiths’ workshops, and gathers the black sludge in her aluminium pan. If she’s lucky, the slime will turn up the precious metal.  Named after the Hindi word for the pans they use, ghamela, there are hundreds of “ghamelawallahs” in Zaveri bazaar – men and women who scavenge grime for gold.Congested, labyrinthine lanes house scores of jewellery workshops and factories, where gold is cut, carved, and shaped. Particles make their way into streets when craftsmen walk out – gold dust gets stuck to their hands, hair or shoes. The particles even get deposited in drains, when goldsmiths wash their hands.“On an average work day, I spend four hours collecting seven to eight pounds of filth and sludge from the streets,” says Wasim Sheikh, 32, a native of the northern Indian city of Agra who migrated to Mumbai a decade ago to pursue his ancestral occupation. As with most other ghamelawallahs, generations of Sheikh’s family have been in the informal trade.After he collects the waste, he submerges it in water. Gold, being heavier, sinks to the bottom, while the mud and dirt float out. He then carries the residue to a secluded corner outside his rented home in Zaveri bazaar, where he lights a tiny furnace to refine the yellow metal. “I add mercury to the residue so that gold particles stick to it, and the trash gets separated. In order to filter out the finer waste – magnetic dust and ferrous particles, I carefully run a tiny magnet over the remains. I then add this residue to a furnace, where I cook it with nitric acid for about 10 to 12 minutes. The acid reacts with mercury to form liquid salts, leaving behind a pellet of gold.”Not every day, however, is lucrative. Mohammed Amir, a 17-year-old, who quit school to join the profession, says the monsoons leave him and his four brothers, also ghamelawallahs, struggling. “All the dirt on the streets gets washed away with rainwater, while the gutters overflow, leaving no scope to identify sewage flecked with gold. Hence, during monsoons, my brothers and I take up other jobs – construction work, hawking at traffic signals or working as domestic labour in homes.”Ghamelawallahs usually collect a gramme or two of gold before selling it to small-time goldsmiths in the bazaar. Mohammed Babloo, 34, says the rates are often lower than market prices. “They tend to haggle with us because they think we’re scavengers, living off sewage from gutters. I normally check rates with at least five buyers before parting with my gold.”But now jewellers, aware of the ghamelawallahs’ work, are increasingly getting cautious about their waste, says Jaymin Zhaveri, a 30-year-old businessman, whose family has been running a jewellery store in the bazaar for 100 years. One shop owner has begun vacuuming and storing the dust. “Workshop owners have started giving uniforms to their craftsmen, which they have to leave behind after work so that gold dust on their clothes is retained with the employers. Others clean the pavements outside their stores themselves, and some even collect the water after goldsmiths wash their hands or shower. All of this waste is preserved over time, and sold to buyers from all over India in bulk,” says Zhaveri. For government street sweepers, meanwhile, the ghamelawallahs are a nuisance. Ranjan Mule, 37, who works with Mumbai’s civic authority, says: “Hundreds of these men and women are out every morning, searching for gold. They collect the dust and sewage, but throw everything else on the streets. There have been instances where ghamelawallahs have stolen garbage off our dumpsters, and littered the waste after.”But ghamelawallahs are undeterred. “Business is good,” says Behre. “In my slum settlement I’m the only woman who wears nose rings and earrings made of real gold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d80b803b962d8eb6be276c9c61c979e1d09bbfe8/0_46_1590_954/master/1590.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39cfe82e7fa15ea9a8e6496caf6b6f19 1240w","title":"france vegetarian foods no meat words","story":"Makers of ‘vegetarian sausages’ and similar items will no longer be able to use meat-related terms after new rulingFrench MPs have voted to ban producers of vegetarian meat substitutes from using words such as steak, bacon or sausage to describe their products if they are are not partly or wholly composed of meat.

Yet even this domestic classic has a thousand variations. We cherry-pick the best to bring you an unbeatable shepherd’s pieThough they may not boast ancient pedigree, the two dishes are not as interchangeable as the likes of Martha Stewart – or indeed, and embarrassingly, the youthful me – would have you believe: just as roast lamb is not cooked in the same way as roast beef, shepherd’s and cottage pie deserve inidual attention. Having tackled the latter way back in 2010, when this column was still wet behind the ears, it feels high time we gave the shepherd his moment in the spotlight. Is this one of those dishes that’s so familiar you don’t need a recipe, or is there anything new to learn about shepherd’s pie?Originally, this was a dish designed to make the Sunday roast go further – the thrifty cook could stretch out the joint until Friday with clever cooking, and such pies were, and still are, often a Monday treat. Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham regard this as a second-best option, writing in The Prawn Cocktail Years that “there is no reason why a shepherd’s pie cannot also be made from a cooked lamb joint, but it turns out better and juicier when made from raw minced meat”.Tom Kerridge and Jamie Oliver clearly disagree, because they roast meat for the purpose: Oliver a lamb shoulder, cooked long, though not particularly low, and then slowly braised in its cooking juices and Kerridge lamb shanks. The testers are excited about these pies after I tell them how long they’ve taken to make, but confess themselves slightly thrown by their consistency, which is, they think, a bit stringy, though both lamb joints had plenty of fat on them.Even lamb mince can vary, however: Eastwood calls specifically for minced lamb shoulder, which she and my butcher explain is a fattier cut than some – and certainly better marbled, darker in colour and stronger in flavour than generic supermarket lamb mince. Whether this is down to the quality of the meat, the cut, or a bit of both is impossible to tell, because the packet stuff doesn’t specify origins, but this dish is certainly worth sourcing decent mince for: it’s never pricey (unless you go down the Ivy road and cut it with minced rib of beef, of course).If you don’t have any lamb drippings handy to cook it in (which you’re unlikely to, unless you’re making it with leftover meat), beef dripping makes a far better, meatier substitute than oil, adding an unmistakable whiff of animal to a dish that was never really going to make the vegetarian heart sing in any case.You can go rogue, if you like – the Ivy puts in shallots, Oliver red onion and Kerridge goes as far as garlic, but I prefer to keep things simple with the time-honoured trinity of yellow onion, celery and carrot, the last cubed, rather than grated as Hopkinson and Bareham suggest, because testers prefer the texture – though, sadly, they’re not keen on Oliver’s swede. I think it seems rather in keeping with the spirit of the dish, though I’d be tempted to bake it first to make it less watery.The Ivy and Eastwood both include mushrooms in their sauces, with the latter writing that many shepherd’s pies lack “depth of flavour. In poncy chef terms, it lacks umami. The mushrooms and mushroom ketchup give this recipe a savoury boost, as do the sun-dried tomatoes.” I agree with her: many recipes do indeed lack a bit of punch, but the testers aren’t keen on the texture of mushrooms here, however finely they’re chopped and the sun-dried tomatoes, though delicious, seem to belong to another dish entirely. “Too fancy,” apparently.But how to add umami without mushrooms or tomato? Meat stock seems the most obvious candidate: slow simmering the mince in lamb stock, as Brown and Hayley and Eastwood recommend, will deliver more savoury flavour than Bareham and Hopkinson’s water. If you can’t find good lamb stock, then beef stock is better than nothing (the Ivy’s veal stock will be, too).Tomatoes are also high in those all-important glutamates – the Ivy uses chopped tomatoes and tomato puree, and Eastwood, Bareham and Hopkinson ketchup, which has its fans, though I find it too sweet and vinegary. Everything ketchup touches ends up tasting of ketchup, so I’m going to use puree instead, plus a good dash of the Ivy’s Worcestershire sauce in place of the Prawn Cocktail Years’ anchovy essence and Kerridge’s red-wine vinegar, which gives his pie a tanginess that works very well with the richness of lamb and potato, but seems at odds with the culinary comfort blanket that is shepherd’s pie.A similar simplicity also seems wise in the herbs and spices department: Eastwood’s exotic star anise, Kerridge’s mace and the Ivy’s oregano are all great options, but you can’t beat thyme and rosemary with lamb.A good shepherd’s – or indeed cottage – pie, needs a solid, but fluffy top: too much milk or butter, and you’ll end up with a sloppy puree instead. Make sure you steam the potatoes dry before mashing, and season generously I like Bareham and Hopkinson’s nutmeg as well as the usual salt and pepper. If you’d like to increase the vegetable content, Eastwood’s butternut squash mash is wonderful, especially with the maple syrup to play off the natural sweetness of the meat, though there should be enough savoury flavour in the filling to negate the need for added cheese (though her parmesan works better than Oliver’s cheddar, and, inspired by Kerridge, I think a hard goat’s cheese would work best of all).Oliver lines his dish with potatoes, too, which I’m excited about – you can never have too much of a good thing – but the panel thinks it makes the dish too claggy, soaking up the gravy and blurring the satisfying distinction between molten filling and dense top. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs, if you think it needs extra crunch, but for me a shepherd’s pie needs no other adornment than its traditional crispy furrows, satisfyingly described by Dickson-Wright as “a ploughed field” of potato. And you don’t get much more rustic than that.2 tbsp good beef dripping (or lamb, if you happen to have some)800g minced lamb, goat, hogget or mutton, preferably from the shoulder, but anyway not “lean”1 large onion, thinly sliced2 large carrots, peeled and diced 3 celery sticks, diced2 sprigs each rosemary and thyme, leaves picked and roughly chopped1 tbsp flour300ml good lamb stock (or beef stock) 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 1 tbsp tomato puree1.5kg floury potatoes100g butter1 tbsp whole milkNutmeg, to grateHeat the fat in a large, heavy-bottomed casserole dish over a medium-high heat, then fry the meat in batches until crisp and well browned all over (not just beige). Transfer the browned meat into a bowl and repeat with the rest.Turn down the heat, add the onion to the pan and cook until it begins to soften. Add the carrots, celery and herbs, and cook until tender but not soft.

Remove the lid and simmer uncovered for a further 15 minutes, then set aside to cool.While the meat is cooking, peel the potatoes and cut them into evenly sized chunks. Boil in well-salted water until tender, then drain well and return to the hot pan to steam dry. Mash with the butter and milk, then season with salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4.Spoon the meat mix into a 30cm x 20cm ovenproof dish, then cover with the mash. Smooth out the top, then use a fork to make furrows over the top – do not skip this stage. Bake for about 30 minutes, until lightly golden on top, then serve with greens.• Are shepherd’s and cottage pie interchangeable (having written this recipe without looking at my cottage pie of eight years ago, I find to my embarrassment the two are remarkably similar) and if not, what changes do you ring between the two?

The second will be a collaborative effort with Kid Cudi and will launch on 8 June.The pair, who have worked together on multiple occasions before, will be known collectively as Kids See Ghost. He has also tweeted two more dates along with other names: Pusha T on 25 May and Teyana Taylor on 22 June. Both stars are part of West’s record label Good Music.The reveal arrives after the rapper has been live-tweeting a philosophy book that is set to be called Break the Simulation. “I’ve got a concept about photographs, and I’m on the fence about photographs – about human beings being obsessed with photographs – because it takes you out of the now and transports you into the past or transports you into the future,” West said in an interview with his interior designer Axel Vervoordt on the Hollywood Reporter.West’s last album The Life of Pablo was released in 2016, featuring guest appearances from Rihanna, Chris Brown and Frank Ocean. Even after the official release, he continued to make changes, calling it “a living, breathing, changing, creative expression”. It became his seventh consecutive number one album in the US yet missed out on the best rap album Grammy to Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book.

Thirty four years ago, when Paul “St Paul” Peterson was the singer in the Family, a band Prince had assembled, he was sitting in his mother’s house in Minneapolis when he received a tape containing Prince’s recording of a song he wanted Peterson to learn for the album he was producing for the group. “I was told to learn Prince’s inflections, his emotions, and the melody line,” the singer remembers, describing how capturing the song’s themes of loss and abandonment meant he had to go “deep”. “So I thought about a girl called Julie, who broke my heart in high school.”It was Nothing Compares 2 U. Prince’s recording went unreleased, the Family’s version became a barely heard album track, but Sinéad O’Connor’s smash 1990 reimagining let the world hear what is now acknowledged as one of Prince’s greatest songs. Today, as Prince’s more electronic, rockier original is finally made public, Peterson – who has been married to Julie for 28 years – is back in his mother’s house. He has just listened to the recording he last heard in 1984 and admits: “I’m freaking out here, man.”Prince’s sound engineer, Susan Rogers, goes back further: she witnessed Nothing Compares 2 U’s birth. In summer 1984, Prince was working in the Flying Cloud Drive Warehouse – his huge rehearsal space before creating Paisley Park – and was on “a creative roll, cranking out a song a day”. He was also in a relationship with the Family’s Susannah Melvoin (who can be heard on backing vocals, alongside St Paul, on Prince’s Nothing Compares 2 U). “It was clear that she was becoming more important than the other girls he’d dated,” Rogers says. “Simultaneously, his young housekeeper, Sandy Scipioni, had to leave suddenly to be with her family because her father died of a heart attack. Sandy ran Prince’s life. He kept asking, ‘When’s Sandy coming back?’”One day, he went into a room with a notebook and, within an hour, emerged with the lyrics to Nothing Compares 2 U. Rogers, who witnessed many such bursts of creativity, remembers, “The song came out like a sneeze.” As usual, she rolled the tapes as Prince laid down instrument after instrument, mixing and overdubbing in the same session (Eric Leeds overdubbed the sax part three days later). Rogers felt the finished song was “exceptional, in his Top 10”, but has a compelling theory about why Prince didn’t release the song under his own name (a live duet with Rosie Gaines appeared years later, on the 1993 compilation, The HitsThe B-Sides).“He wasn’t living with anyone, but he was a young man writing about domesticity. The line ‘all the flowers that you planted in my back yard went out and died’… it would have been Sandy who planted those flowers. ‘And I know that living with me baby is sometimes hard, but I’m willing to give it another try…’ There was no romantic relationship with Sandy. It’s not a pained ‘Help me, baby’ track. It’s: ‘You’re gone and I miss you,’ which is probably why he felt comfortable giving the song away to the Family. He released his material based on what he wanted us to know about him and, wonderful as it is, he didn’t want it to represent him.”“Prince was the most courageous person I ever met,” Rogers explains. “He realised he had to socially handicap himself to be the artist he wanted to be, and that to do that without being an asshole he had to be a complete enigma. My gut feeling is that everything he recorded should be released, so that people can understand where he came from and keep his memory alive.”• Nothing Compares 2 U is available as a stream and digital single. A 7in picture disc is exclusively available via the Prince official store. A black vinyl 7in is out on 25 May. The Family now tour and record as fDeluxe, and appear at the annual Paisley Park celebration in Minneapolis, which runs until 22 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ed86694c5bd9c84ce1139b1b6d7651c45d49b4/4_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f008834cf684aec8e781c0a2703912b9 1240w","title":"jessie js cultural revolution how a middle grade pop monster saved china","story":"Well, it was the power ballad heard around the world – by which I mean heard in a variety of Asian emerging markets, but not the UK. Anyway, Jessie J has won a Chinese TV singing competition! Not since Deng Xiaoping’s government allowed Bernardo Bertolucci to use the Forbidden City for The Last Emperor has a Chinese cultural engagement with the west felt quite so epic.Think of Jessie as The Last Empress. God knows, she does. I’m kidding, I’m kidding. It has been a few years since madam was explaining how her broken foot had given her “a different respect now for people who don’t have legs”. Still, let’s give the classic interview another hop-out.“Just after I broke my foot,” Jessie told Q magazine, “I was in the living room and I put on Beyoncé’s Save the Hero. Like, ‘If I’m not around, who saves the superhero?’ You give so much as an artist – you give, you give, you give. I break my foot and I’ve got fans going: ‘I’ve got a tummy ache, can I get a retweet?’ People think you go to a special hospital, get special casts and treatment. It’s like: ‘No, I’m the same as everyone else,’ and that was the moment when I had a proper cry.”I don’t mind admitting I cry in a happy way every time I reread that quote. Touring the vast Lost in Showbiz archive facility earlier today, I see I had filed Jessie away in a section entitled Middle-Grade Monsters of Pop. Although this latest Chinese escapade doesn’t require her to be formally reclassified, I think we can bump her up to her own dedicated shelf.But first, a recap: for the past three months, popstar and former Voice judge Jessie J has been in China competing in a televised singing competition called Singer. Contrary to many reports, this is not the equivalent of The X Factor. All the singers competing are established, so it is rather less horrendous than Jessie J twerking in professionally to pluck the opportunity away from an angelic-voiced Chinese amateur, all the while singing that it’s not about the money, money, money. Or, indeed, the cha-ching cha-ching.Here is Jessie’s version: “Last year, I was asked to compete in a singing competition in China. Performing alongside the biggest established singersartists across Asia.”Tantalisingly, the Do It Like a Dude legend doesn’t elaborate on how the request was communicated. For my part, I believe it to have been made in a bilateral Sino-British huddle during a session break of the UN security council. But I suppose it is conceivable they went via the record label. Either way, the message is that China actively wanted Jessie. She wasn’t just something atrocious we visited upon them, like the opium wars.Why did Jessie say yes? “It was an opportunity to bridge a gap between two cultures,” she explains. “For them to see a western performer and hear music some had never heard before and vice versa.”Can’t help feeling vice versa is doing some heavy lifting there. But Jessie seems determined to effect – how to put this? – a sort of cultural revolution, whereby Chinese people are improved and spiritually elevated via exposure to her personage. The show’s formal victory publicity material shows her posing in floor-length diamanté with an arched eyebrow and talking about learning experiences, an aesthetic I’m afraid I’m going to have to call “re-education high camp”.“Seeing the boundaries break down,” Jessie goes on, “and the rules be shifted made this whole experience incredible … What we all won” – Oh man, she is really doing this – “What we all won was the beginning of something really magical. I am so happy I got to play a part.”Only time will show whether historians of this era in Chinese history will ultimately judge Jessie’s part the more significant, or will plump for Xi Jinping’s recent constitutional amendment revoking the two-term limit on the presidency.What we know for sure is that Jessie won last Sunday night, singing I Will Always Love You in front of a reported TV audience of one billion. “Jessie J could earn £20m” screams a typical headline, somehow resisting the temptation to predict a great leap forward for her career. The local news outlets have gone with a different line, meanwhile. According to Xinhua, the Chinese news agency: “She said she did not participate in the show for an award but to bring more good works to the audience.” Yes, it is almost as if Jessie … just wants to make the world dance? (You will note that even Chinese state media can’t get the wretched Price Tag out of their brains. Once heard, it is incurable. Your only hope is managing the condition.)Incidentally, if you have a spare 36 hours – and which of us doesn’t? – I do recommend a visit to Wikipedia to look at the full competition rules of Singer, which make the Glass Bead game look like Snap. So byzantine are the voting procedures that you feel they could only have been conceived in a non-democracy with the specific intention of convincing the audience that suffrage is such an arcane and impenetrable time-suck that they are all much better off without it.Which reminds me: it was Simon Cowell, the Karaoke Sauron himself, who a few years ago said of X Factor-style shows: “The great thing is where you start seeing it in places like China and Afghanistan. It’s democracy. We’ve kind of given democracy back to the world.” Thank you, Simon.Quick democracy update: Xi has dispensed with consensus rule and checks on his power the biggest star of the US reality era sits in the White House with the FBI investigating his phoneline support and Cowell’s oft-stated belief that British referendums were a great idea is ageing like a fine wine. So, do take a moment to appreciate Simon. The golden age of reality TV did so much for the age that followed it, in ways we are still only beginning to understand.None of which is to detract from Jessie’s victory, which – as she makes clear – flowed from the decision specifically to target her. “I was the first international artist to ever be askedcompete,” she declares. “An honour alone.”It is certainly the most audacious Chinese claim to a British property since the 1982 summit where Deng told Margaret Thatcher that China could forcibly requisition Hong Kong if it wanted to. In the end, of course, it didn’t need to. And so with Jessie J.I suppose these handovers are best done peacefully, and I am sure we Brits handled our end of things in that wistfully dignified, post-imperial way of ours. The studio audience for Jessie’s victory song presumably included a tearful Chris Patten. There would have followed a retiring of the flag, and a Last Post feat Jessie J. All the years in flashback, all the memories crowding in – but she is theirs now. God bless her. God bless China. God bless them all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fe16c8ee820d693b4830cbefa23441f5f1db162/2_0_10413_6250/master/10413.jpg?w=10250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de1d50ca2e10c45b1f91e8e51e04fa90 20500w","title":"wolves of instagram jordan belmont social media traders","story":"Their hero is Jordan Belfort, their social media feeds display super-rich lifestyles. But what are these self-styled traders really selling? By  Symeon BrownThe original Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, was a rogue trader convicted of fraudulently selling worthless penny stocks to naive investors. His biopic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the ostentatious, money-obsessed huckster, was a box-office hit in 2013. Although it may have been intended as a cautionary tale, to thousands of young millennials from humble backgrounds, Belfort’s story became a blueprint for how to escape an unremarkable life on low pay.Within months of the Wolf of Wall Street’s UK premiere in January 2014, a stocky 21-year-old named Elijah Oyefeso from a south London housing estate, began broadcasting on social media how much money he was making as a stock-market whizzkid. His thousands of young followers were desperate to do the same. As Oyefeso’s online fame grew, he caught the attention of TV producers. In January 2016, Oyefeso was featured in the Channel 4 show Rich Kids Go Shopping, in which he bought expensive jumpers to give to homeless people and showed viewers how easy it was to make stock trades online.Even before Oyefeso’s appearance on mainstream TV, his story had already gone viral. British tabloids, including the Daily Mail, the Evening Standard and the Mirror, as well as a host of online magazines targeted at young men, all ran pieces about his success. The Mail headline described him as a university dropout who supposedly used his student loan to start trading financial products online and “now claims he earns £30,000 on a BAD month – by working just ONE HOUR a day”.It’s an image of self-made wealth and ridiculous luxury, and one that Oyefeso has intensively cultivated online. The videos on his almost comedic YouTube channel, which have hundreds of thousands of views, feature him buying £250,000 cars and boarding private jets as nonchalantly as others his age might hail an Uber. His Instagram, which regularly shows him posing next to a blue and silver Rolls-Royce, describes him as the founder of DCT, his trading firm. DCT stands for “Dreams Come True”.“I’m never going to work for someone,” Oyefeso says in one of his videos, in a somewhat cartoonish, nasal voice, while he drives his Rolls dressed in a bathrobe. “Look what I’ve built: a foundation. A brand.”For many young people from areas such as the poorer part of Camberwell in south London where Oyefeso grew up, or those who have come across him on social media, Oyefeso’s portrayal as a self-made millionaire has given him the heroic status of a footballer or rapper.“I’m just a normal guy and most people who come from where I’m from, they see if I can do it, they can do it,” Oyefeso told me. He has described DCT Trading as a future Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan – except, unlike those mammoth financial institutions, which tend to recruit from a narrow pool of elite graduates from prestigious universities, Oyefeso appeared to be opening a closed door to young people who might otherwise be excluded from the trading floor.Oyefeso has sent out thousands of invitations with the message “join my team”. The problem is, his company does not have a trading floor. It does not have an office. Dreams Come True isn’t registered at Companies House. It does not exist as anything more than a website and some social media accounts. (Oyefeso claims the parent company, Gabs Fossard Ltd, is registered, although it was dissolved without posting any income.)Oyefeso is one of the most high-profile figures of an internet subculture that reveres Jordan Belfort and has taken his Wolf of Wall Street persona to social media. Posing as ultra-wealthy kids and posting internet memes taken from the movie, its followers aggressively sign up young people to what looks like an international pyramid scheme that has helped to generate billions of pounds for large companies selling highly risky financial trading products.They are the wolves of Instagram.The financial sector has a genius for creating new products that brush against the law. A former UBS trader told me that the sector had taken advantage of the grey area between what they know they can’t do and what they believe they can get away with. In 2008, as the economy reeled under the weight of trillions of dollars of bad debt in financial products called collateralised debt obligations, another risky and obscure proposition was being designed for the public: the binary option.The concept is simple: you sign up with a minimum deposit of £250 from a debit or credit card, click a button that says you are over 18, then bet on whether the price of a stock, currency or other financial security will go up or down and by how much. The binary option is part of a family of similar financial products such as spread betting and contracts for difference. If you have ever heard a rookie investor declare that they trade currency, these are probably what they are talking about.These products became popular alongside a proliferation of online trading software and mobile betting platforms. The craze was largely driven by two countries – Israel and Cyprus – in the late 2000s. Their regulatory frameworks meant that firms could access European markets without the heavy hand of European regulators, and new binary options companies spread like chain letters. After the financial crash, in Israel alone an estimated 100 firms popped up in the space of a few years.Over the past 18 months, these financial products have taken great leaps into public life with expensive marketing campaigns. Plus500, which is to online trading what McDonald’s is to fast food, is the main sponsor of European football giant Atlético Madrid, and 24Option have sponsored the renowned MMA fighter Conor McGregor and Italian football team Juventus.Binary options are considered so volatile that they have been banned outright in the US. However, in the UK, which has some of the most liberal financial regulations in the world, they were until January of this year classified as high-risk gambling products and regulated by the Gambling Commission. Since then, they have been under the auspices of the FCA, which published a list of unauthorised firms and guidelines for aspiring traders.The mystery is how such complex products became an internet youth craze. And this is where the wolves of Instagram swagger in. Oyefeso described himself as a social media “influencer”, which means he and others like him can use Instagram and Twitter to sell the trading platforms a supply of teenagers and young adults with limited knowledge of the money markets and a hunger for success.This is how it works. Oyefeso posts images of luxury goods he claims to have bought with his winnings. He gives the pictures hashtags such as #richkidsofinstagram and mass-follows young people online. One teenager told me he and his friends were drawn in by the sight of a young black man who grew up on a council estate similar to theirs, driving a Rolls-Royce. As soon as anyone follows Oyefeso back, he slides into their DMs with a message: “I’m offering a great opportunity to earn £100-400+ per week from trading, no experience required, all done from home and only requires 15-30 min per day.” If you’re young, poor and want to defy the odds against you, the next question is: where do I sign up?What wolves like Oyefeso fail to declare is that each of the trading platforms you sign up to (with a minimum deposit of £250) pays him around £40-80 – and that recruitment, rather than betting on these predatory financial products, is the way he makes his risk-free money (Oyefeso maintains he’s making money from trading). Young people join the platforms, make a few trades and can lose anything between £250 and several thousand pounds, then realise they can make it back by repeating the trick: becoming a paid marketing affiliate masquerading as a successful trader. It looks like a vintage pyramid scheme, rebooted for the social media era using a model of e-marketing that has boomed over the last 20 years.It is almost impossible to count the number of marketing affiliates masquerading as successful traders on Instagram, but we can count the number of promotional posts they’ve made using hashtags such as #binaryoptions (222,206), #traderlifestyle (64,151), and #richkidsofinstagram (529,574). Those numbers rise by the minute and the thousands of accounts generating them appear and disappear constantly.The companies making the real money from these financial gambling products are supposed to be kept in check by the ASA, the Gambling Commission and the FCA – but this pack of regulators appears to be outfoxed by the wolves. The National Fraud Authority estimated that £59m had been defrauded from UK residents in 2017 from binary options alone.“These binary options are almost no-win gambling products masquerading as complex financial instruments,” Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, one of a number of politicians who have issued warnings about such products, told me. “It’s outrageous they are being targeted at the most vulnerable gamblers and young people.”Many of the most exploitative companies’ digital storefronts drift anonymously in the middle of the internet, virtually undiscoverable to people who don’t know they are there and aren’t looking for them. This is where the influencers and their social media accounts come in. In Oyefeso’s words: “I just saw a big hole and I filled it up, which any successful entrepreneur would do.”My first meeting with Oyefeso was on a summer’s afternoon in 2016. He and some of his friends were parked up on a private housing estate in Canary Wharf, having arrived in a convoy of supercars, including Oyefeso’s Rolls and a rented Audi R8. The neighbourhood was meant to serve as a backdrop to the world of opulence they were displaying on their Instagram feeds. It was not long before a resident came out to tell us we were trespassing. “This is a private estate, we don’t want to associate this estate with those kinds of people,” he said.Instagram – even more than Facebook or Twitter – is where people sell a version of their lives that they want people to believe. None more so than these young, self-proclaimed millionaires. They are part of the larger phenomenon of #richkidsofinstagram, a hashtag first used in 2012 to profile the genuine heirs of multimillion-pound estates – including a son of one of the West Ham football club owners – but then spread to people like Oyefeso, who were faking it. A search of the posts tagged #richkidsofinstagram reveals young men and women from across the world sharing pictures and videos of their extravagant lifestyles: suitcases filled with stacks of £10, £20 and £50 notes toddlers wearing customised Gucci denim jackets expensive cars and private jets, all set to the latest hip-hop anthems.For Oyefeso and many of his friends, the lifestyle is largely a costume drama. In his most recent video on YouTube Oyefeso appeared to hire a private jet – one that was parked up – to announce his return after he left prison. Oyefeso recounted how much money he could make in 15 minutes. Yet in reality, the only company I could find registered to Oyefeso’s address – IWANTTOTRADE Ltd, was dissolved in 2016 without posting a penny of income. Despite his glamorous trappings, Oyefeso, the son of Nigerian migrants, is, on paper at least, still residing at their council flat in south London.In reality, #richkidsofinstagram is mostly a feed of adverts selling everything from clothes to gambling products, featuring endless marketing affiliates trying to recruit young people who are under more and more pressure from friends and influencers on social media to buy their way to success. The @richkidslondon account, followed by more than 730,000 people, says it profiles the most impressive rich kids, but what it does not say is that it charges them £60 for a post or £350 for 10.According to a close friend, Oyefeso got his start in this world in 2014, when he began working at One Two Trade (OTT), a bucket shop operated out of a backstreet office in Wapping, east London, where unwitting investors could register bets online. OTT, which is not a regulated financial institution in the UK, but registered in Panama and Malta, would take a cut of every trade, and then try to hustle investors out of the rest of their money using excessive commissions and other exploitative terms. Former staff describe it as overrun with young people who had lost money on the platform, trying to make it back by signing up their friends with trading accounts.For young people with ambition but no access, who were attracted to the risk, ingenuity and wealth of investment banks and hedge funds but would not qualify for a job at a traditional Canary Wharf company, working at OTT felt like a genuine career in the City – despite being unpaid. Oyefeso began styling himself as a guru offering “signals”, or trading tips, while working as a marketing affiliate. According to one of his mentees, he was a frontrunner in a burgeoning scene of young black outsiders, most of whom knew each other, spinning stories about how they infiltrated the old white man’s world of finance.On Oyefeso’s website there is a section where he recommends a range of financial betting platforms. He also showed me a WhatsApp group he charged thousands of young people a £69.99 monthly fee to join, which would instruct them on what to bet on next. Unbeknown to his “clients”, they were the product he was selling.The flashy Instagram may have won him a following, but the biggest gift to Oyefeso was his TV appearance. “After Rich Kids Go Shopping, he was so exposed,” one of his close friends said. “Before, it was just a small black community that was going to him, people that wanted to make quick money would go to him, but when he got put on the TV he had clients in Scotland.”I asked Oyefeso who started the traders of Instagram subculture. “Without being cocky, I think I did,” he said. Without Oyefeso to “show people that you can have this, that you can buy this house, that you can buy this car”, there might not have been the traders of Instagram business model. A rival who copied him agreed. “It started from Elijah,” she said. “He was putting it all on social media. When they are seeing a young black man buy a Bentley or a Rolls-Royce and who is constantly on TV and he’s getting a lot of publicity, they’re thinking, what is this guy doing? I want to be involved.”Then came a binary options gold rush among one of the most unlikely of demographics – young people in Britain’s inner cities.Oyefeso marketed for a range of legitimate companies, including 24Option and AvaTrade, registered in Cyprus and Ireland, respectively, which have an estimated combined annual revenue of nearly $90m. (Neither company responded to a request for comment.) Oyefeso also introduced his young audience to Banc de Binary, a company he describes as “fully good”, even after it ceased trading amid fraud allegations.Banc de Binary was founded in 2009 in Israel. The man at the helm was a former Israeli paratrooper, Oren Shabat Laurent. At its peak, the company had a yearly revenue of $100m, making it a star among binary options companies. The firm sought respectability by sponsoring football teams such as Liverpool and Southampton, but both clubs dropped the company when it become embroiled in scandal.Banc de Binary faced a string of multi-million dollar lawsuits from clients, and was pursued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It was fined $11m for major regulatory breaches such as using shell offices in the UK and the US to evade financial regulations. The company was kicked out of the US in 2013, and was denied access to European markets when it lost its licence in Israel soon after that. In January 2017, the company ceased trading when it was revealed to have used software rigged against its users. Its founder, Laurent, has since reinvented himself in the world of cryptocurrency, with a bigger online following than any of the influencers who peddled binary options for him. Laurent did not respond to requests for comment.Part of what made Oyefeso and Banc de Binary’s practices so ruthless was the age of the people they were signing up. In the UK, you have to be 18 to gamble or speculate on financial transactions. But Oyefeso was openly targeting much younger teenagers. It appears that in doing so, he was violating advertising regulations on gambling products.When I spoke to Oyefeso before he went to prison, he did not exhibit much regret. “I’m not going to lie to you, there are some people under 18 who trade and use their parent’s name,” Oyefeso told me. I asked him if he had worked with anyone under 18 directly. “Of course,” he said. Aren’t you breaching the rules? I asked. “If I am, why aren’t I behind bars?” he said.It seems Oyefeso didn’t just see teenagers as a source of income. They were also a source of labour. I spoke to one 18-year-old who told me that when he was between 15 and 16, he received a message from Oyefeso telling him he could sign up to a trading platform using his mother’s details. Oyefeso then offered the boy and his school friends work running his social media accounts and messaging his followers with advertising scripts. The teenagers were paid a cut of the commission for every one they signed up.The pack of Instagram wolves has spread far beyond Oyefeso’s network in London. Twenty-three-year-old Eddy Samuel grew up on the outskirts of Manchester. The city has received billions in private and public investment, but Samuel was not well placed to benefit from the new jobs that new money created.“I hardly got any GCSEs,” Samuel recently told me. “I got one Btec. I never really had an education.” After a string of minimum-wage jobs, he did some landscape gardening. “That was my last ever job,” he said. Together with two friends, he was drawn into the supposedly glamorous Instagram-world of fast cars and designer clothes that young men the same age as them appeared to have. The pressure to join them was almost torturous.“We are all from council estates – every single one of us,” Samuel said. “Seeing other people do it and wanting to get involved in it ourselves, being broke. I’m out of a job, we’re like – we need something else to get things going.” The company they launched, called Trading XL, has never been registered at Companies House.Even those losing money on Banc de Binary and other platforms sometimes gained a sense of self-confidence and an identity they felt proud of. Young men soon started trading in their hoodies for three-piece, pinstripe suits even though they had no office to wear them to. The subculture even had an anthem. A one-time Instagram trader who goes by the handle 10KJunes released a rap track called Trading Life, which includes the line, “I be selling stocks and then I buy it back, I got the taxman thinking that I’m selling crack”.Technology has made some jobs extinct and endangered entire sectors, but in a tough jobs market, affiliate work seems like the most accessible route to money. There is no interview or licence required. All that is needed, in most cases, is an email address and a bank account. The marketers earn on commission only, so they provide a growing class of cheap labour.A decade ago, teenagers primarily used social media to keep up with their friends and interests. In 2018, many see curating their accounts as a career and there is a growing ecosystem making this a major challenge for advertising regulators. Adverts are supposed to be identifiable, but influencers blur the lines with account pages built as shop windows on their lives. This grey area allowed foreign firms reliant on UK-based influencers to operate with impunity. Experts suggest that the regulators could have gone after marketing affiliates as “facilitators of gambling” sales, but chose not to.Plus500, which is valued at over £1bn, has an estimated 100,000 marketing affiliates working for it alone. The @dailyforexsignals account on Instagram appeared to be promoting the company with posts that the Campaign for Fairer Gambling claimed were in breach of the guidelines. However, Plus500 said the account had signed up just eight clients and the company had long cancelled @dailyforexsignals affiliation. It says it offers customers a test to indicate they understand the terms of trading, and has measures to ensure protection of its customers, including limiting the amount clients can lose. It says it requires all affiliates to comply with industry standards, but it is difficult to see how a company such as Plus500 keeps tabs on the thousands of unmanaged digital workers making it money. This in turn makes it hard to stop it profiting from vulnerable consumers – in particular, from young people hooked in by the promise of easy wealth.In 2005, the Labour government liberalised gambling advertising and created the Gambling Commission to regulate commercial gambling and protect vulnerable people, including anyone under 25. Tom Watson, the current deputy Labour leader, admitted that the legislation didn’t take the digital era into account.“The yield taken from losers in the industry has gone up from £8bn in 2008 to £13bn in 2016,” Watson said. “That’s a lot of money, and when you combine that with recent news that companies are targeting the most vulnerable people who are susceptible to becoming problem gamblers – I think we’ve got a problem and our current regulations and laws are not fit for purpose.”Matt Zarb-Cousin, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, alleges that the wolves’ Instagram posts are breaching two ASA regulations, “the first of which is: you can’t market to young people, and the second is: gambling cannot be offered as a way of making money. So these adverts would never pass the regulators if they were conventional.”The Gambling Commission has admitted that it had received a growing number of complaints when it was in the process of trying to regulate binary options, but the Campaign for Fairer Gambling says neither it nor the ASA had taken strong enough action on the advertising of such profits to vulnerable young adults. The Gambling Commission acknowledged it had never even “written to Instagram relating to advertisements or posts promoting gambling, that breach the UK advertising codes” during the time of the steepest rise in complaints.Both regulators blame the 2005 legislation. The Gambling Commission said that although binary options were regulated, the rules only applied if the firm had “remote gambling equipment located in Great Britain, irrespective of whether there are offices in GB or not”. The law states that if equipment is not in Britain, any binary options that the firm offers will not be regulated. Last month, the European Securities and Market Authority decided to prohibit the sales of binary options and limit the marketing and distribution of related products to vulnerable retail consumers. However, the wolves of Instagram have already adapted their behaviour.“Everything is changing, so obviously I’ve got to change, too,” Oyefeso said to me last year, when the landscape began to shift.One of Oyefeso’s business associates has leapt headfirst into the latest gold rush. “I recently got into bitcoin about three months ago,” he said. “Young people have just jumped to it and it’s like the (binary options) trading bubble all over again.”The cryptocurrency craze is in many ways similar to the boom in binary options and digital gambling apps. There have now been over 1,560 different currencies launched. Most of them are worthless but a host of new platforms are trying to hawk them via dubious platforms that entice young people through marketing affiliates disguised as Instagram influencers.One of Oyefeso’s early proteges was a north Londoner called Olivia James, 23. She described the original Wolf of Wall Street as “a king in my eyes”, and in February tweeted “I’m do everything Belfort done and more lifestyle wise”. Hoping to take advantage of the popularity of bitcoin, James has now incorporated a new company called TRADEtoGAIN, with 20-year-old Armon Rabiee and 24-year-old Luke Arliss. The trio share a common story with many of the other young people founding pop-up sites to teach young adults how they can crack cryptocurrencies, for exorbitant fees. Arliss struggled at school, James was repeatedly turned down for entry level jobs in the City and Rabiee said he lost thousands during the binary options wave as a teenager. Together, they plan to make money as gurus of crypto.Arliss, who has a big Instagram following from his former company, which repaired bodywork on footballers’ cars, said that he gets “loads of messages” about crypto from young people “interested in the hype”. Rabiee piped in, claiming that with their special insight they “can charge people thousands”.As Oyefeso’s fairytale has unravelled, the internet has turned against him. People shared reports of his arrest and sentence with mocking comments, and published blogs accusing him of running scams. Oyefeso responded with a caption on a recent video post: “People don’t want to see a young black guy from the ends make it out to be successful,” he wrote.The problem, in Oyefeso’s case, has not been a lack of goodwill. There were many who shared his original rags to riches story, unaware that there was another version in which this apparently wealthy young trader was an invention, incentivised by companies happy to exploit the gap between the life millennials are persuaded they should be living, and the harsh economic reality they live in.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91051e1cd080a63229423c43d066ee286ab1f261/946_471_3705_2223/master/3705.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9f971ae293c3d8b25c7e2dc6f25d7066 1240w","title":"backbench mps motion force vote eu customs union","story":"Theresa May faces new rebellion after House of Lords defeat Theresa May next week faces a show of defiance from MPs fighting to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU after 10 select committee chairs tabled a motion aimed at forcing a vote on the issueThree Conservatives – Bob Neill, Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston – are among the signatories to the motion, which urges the government to “include as an objective in negotiations ... the establishment of an effective customs union”.The government lost a vote in the House of Lords on Wednesday night by a hefty majority of 123 on a cross-party amendment that would force ministers to report to parliament on their moves to keep the UK in a customs union.MPs campaigning against a hard Brexit, including Anna Soubry and Chuka Umunna, have tabled amendments to the trade bill and customs bill demanding that the option of a customs union be kept on the table.But the government has delayed bringing the legislation back to the Commons, avoiding the risk of an embarrassing defeat, so the select committee chairs are using their power to raise issues in the Commons to force a vote.Other signatories include Labour’s Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ Norman Lamb, and the Scottish National party’s Angus MacNeil.Supporters of a customs union hope the debate will underline the lack of support in parliament for taking the UK out of the customs union.Soubry said: “You will get the mood of the House: that’s important. If Theresa May wanted to, she could change her mind on this.”But Jacob Rees Mogg, chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of backbenchers, warned against the liaison committee - made up of the select committee chairs - politicising its role.“It is unusual for the liaison committee to propose a motion and makes it more a political pressure group rather than the guardians of the rights of the House of Commons. In behaving this way, it regrettably devalues itself,” he said.The motion from the committee chairs came as the government dismissed claims that its proposals for avoiding border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic had been subjected to a “forensic annihilation” by EU negotiators.After talks on Wednesday between the two sides, the Telegraph quoted senior EU diplomatic sources saying the government’s proposals for resolving the issue had been rejected. “It was a detailed and forensic rebuttal. It was made clear that none of the UK’s customs options will work. None of them.”While government sources rejected the idea that May’s proposals had been comprehensively dismantled by negotiatiors, they are concerned about what they regard as the inflexible approach adopted by the EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his team.A government spokesman said: “We have been clear that we will protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market. That commitment was set out in December’s joint report which also includes our guarantee of avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We are continuing an intensive work programme to engage on all the scenarios set out in the joint report.” Those wanting to remain in a customs union – which would avoid border checks, but constrain the UK from striking its own trade deals – are concerned about the impact on the economy if the UK left.The motion “notes the government’s expressed aim to provide the freest and most frictionless possible trade” with the EU and “further notes the importance of frictionless trade without tariffs, customs or border checks for manufacturers and businesses”.Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, and Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee, said: “With just six months to go before the Brexit deal needs to be concluded, we are running out of time for parliament to help to shape the negotiations. “Yet many of our backbench committees have forensically gathered evidence on different Brexit options and the practical implications. That is why committee chairs at the liaison committee – including those who voted leave and who voted remain, supporters and opponents of a customs union – concluded that backbench MPs should get the chance of an early constructive debate and vote on this crucial issue, not bound by the party whips, but informed by committee evidence instead.“If parliament stays silent until after the deal is done, that is just a recipe for conflict and regret later on. Far better for us to debate this properly now and let parliamentarians express their view before it is too late.”The vote will be non binding but, after the defeat in the Lords on Wednesday, its proponents hope it will demonstrate there is no majority in the Commons for leaving the customs union, something May has insisted on since her Lancaster House speech last January.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: “This is further evidence of the growing chorus of cross-party voices concerned that Theresa May’s position on a customs union is wrong in principle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4bd88332958e9ead855119d94f83982bacd2c1b/0_162_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=174bb03f9a937f8b47b03fcb1fa4395b 1240w","title":"hmrc refusal aid french inquiry lycamobile tory donor questioned","story":"MPs are to investigate an HM Revenue and Customs decision to turn down a French request for help with a criminal inquiry into a major Conservative party donor. The Treasury select committee and the public accounts committee want to explore why tax officials rejected a request from the French authorities to help with an inquiry involving the mobile network operator Lycamobile.It follows the disclosure on Thursday that the tax authority had sent correspondence to its French counterparts which pointed out that the telecoms company was the “biggest corporate donor to the Conservative party”.Labour said there were serious questions for the government and the tax authority to answer. Jeremy Corbyn said: “HMRC is a government agency, it is part of our government and it should investigate every company without fear and without favour about its tax affairs to make sure they pay the correct amount of tax and there’s no hiding place, no evasion from it, whoever they are.”Lycamobile had donated more than £2.1m to the Conservative party until French police two years ago launched an inquiry into alleged criminal activity by iniduals at the company. No legal proceedings have been taken against Lycamobile itself.In March 2017, French officials asked HMRC to assist with investigations in the UK, but the request was refused.The parliamentary investigations have been launched after correspondence between British and French tax officials was leaked to the news website BuzzFeed. One letter, sent to French officials from the team at HMRC that handles law enforcement requests from foreign governments, said: “It is of note that they are the biggest corporate donor to the Conservative party led by Prime Minister Theresa May.” A spokesman for Lycamobile said: “Lycamobile has not contributed to the Conservative party since July 2016. Lycamobile continues to deny all allegations being implied by BuzzFeed.” Whitehall sources said the information about donations had been “regrettably” included as background information only and had no bearing on the decision. An HMRC spokesman said the organisation had acted correctly as there were not enough details given by the French authorities to secure a search warrant. “The application contained insufficient detail to satisfy the legal requirements to secure a warrant. “After the French request was rejected, HMRC continued to liaise with the French authorities to explain the statutory requirements for a UK search warrant, and offered to meet the French judge face to face to explain those requirements. “HMRC always investigates suspected rule-breaking professionally and objectively and is never influenced by political considerations.”May’s spokesman told a Westminster briefing: “HMRC never takes political donations into account when it makes decisions on whether to investigate a business. The request was rejected because it did not contain sufficient information for HMRC to seek a search warrant.”A Conservative party spokesman said: “All donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law.” Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, said: “This clearly raises all sorts of questions and is completely inappropriate. I would expect the committee to look into this as part of our economic crime review and to have some early questions for HMRC about the correspondence that they sent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/427f20ed1ec4bfc90949c48c00f410c7495a8192/82_91_1458_875/master/1458.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=edad10b1ac9be5c167609707a2150ba0 1240w","title":"destruction at the ancient site of mari in syria","story":"The ancient city was one of the first archaeological sites to be occupied by Islamic State. Now new photos are revealing the fate of this important site as archaeologists continue to count the cultural cost of IsisThree weeks ago, the Syrian antiquities directorate released new photos showing another devastated archaeological site. Outside Syria the news has received fairly limited press attention, except in France, where Mari, the site in question, is much better known. French archaeologists have been excavating at Mari since 1933, the most recent expedition running until 2010 when the Arab Spring and growing unrest made the site inaccessible. In light of the level of damage which is now evident, perhaps it’s worth sparing a moment to look at why Mari matters to archaeologists, historians and the cultural heritage of Syria.When Islamic State emerged, the part of Deir ez-Zor province in which Mari lies was one of the first areas to fall under its control in early 2014. Under IS, the site suffered an immediate explosion of looting satellite images revealed the change from archaeological site to lunar landscape in a matter of months. More than 1,500 new looting pits were recorded at Mari between 2013 and 2015, likely representing the removal of a huge quantity of ancient objects, sold into the illegal antiquities market to fund Isis and its war.Sadly, this is a story common to many archaeological sites across the region, but Mari isn’t just another site. For archaeologists it’s one of the most important sites so far excavated for those interested in understanding the great urban centres of Bronze Age Mesopotamia, or in ing into the turbulent politics of the second millennium BC. Mari was home to an extraordinary palace. The earliest major structure dates to around 2500-2300 BC, and part of this early palace was restored and preserved at the site, providing a unique opportunity to walk through a third millennium BC Mesopotamian palace, standing almost to its roof beams. This palace area is now very badly damaged. Its protective roof was compromised by a sand storm in 2011, and the security situation at that time left it impossible to make repairs, but the recently released photos show that large parts of the palace’s 2m thick walls have now collapsed. Prof Pascal Butterlin, who directed excavations at the site up until 2010, believes such a level of destruction suggests that explosives, either ground based or more likely from air strikes, were probably involved, adding to the damage caused by looting for financial gain. Butterlin gave a paper detailing the plight of Mari at the International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East conference in Munich two weeks ago, to general dismay.For archaeologists and historians, Mari’s royal palace is more famous in its later form. In around 1800 BC the palace was remodelled and expanded by the Lim dynasty and the excavation of this building has provided the most complete picture available of the life of a royal palace and the functioning of a Bronze Age city state. This is in part due to the good preservation of the architecture and the almost complete excavation of the palace’s 300 rooms, but also to the 25,000 cuneiform tablets recovered during the excavations, which mostly date to this time. The texts preserved on the tablets have left us the names of the rulers of Mari, provided a wealth of detail about the city and its people, and opened an exceptional window on the politics and diplomacy of the ancient Near East through the preservation of royal letters between the kings of Mari and the rulers of neighbouring kingdoms. Ruling Mari wasn’t an easy job the city was surrounded by more powerful kingdoms and beset by frequent internal troubles. King Yaggid-Lim was killed by his servants, while Yahdun-Lim was assassinated by his own son, who in turn was also assassinated after a reign of just two years. The best-known king of Mari was Zimri-Lim a contemporary of the mighty Hammurabi of Babylon, famous for the earliest surviving law code.Zimri-Lim, whose father also seems to have been assassinated by untrustworthy servants, managed to wrestle Mari back from a rival royal house. He married Shibtu, a princess from the kingdom of Yamad, centred at modern Aleppo. They had at least eight daughters and many letters between the king and his grown-up daughters survive to illustrate a close and fond fatherly relationship. Zimri-Lim was less successful in his relationship with Hammurabi. After being an ally of Babylon in its wars with Elam and the city state of Larsa, the diplomatic relationship between Zimri-Lim and Hammurabi gradually soured, culminating in a Babylonian army being dispatched to conquer Mari in 1761 BC. It’s impossible to tell how much more of this history may have been hacked out of the ground by the IS-sponsored looters, written on tablets which were sold to fund the fighting.Zimri-Lim disappeared from the historical record when his city fell, presumably because he didn’t survive the encounter, but his palace did survive along with the records of his fourteen-year reign. The palace constructed by the kings of Mari was of unusual magnificence, and the diplomatic texts suggest it was famous in its day as one of the largest and most luxurious royal palaces in existence, the envy of other rulers. The huge courtyards were planted with palm trees and the walls of the palace were painted with elaborate scenes and decorative designs, including a large fresco showing the investiture of Zimri-Lim as King, now displayed in the Louvre. The palace’s chapel contained a life-sized statue of a goddess, which was drilled through so that real water could run from the mouth of the vase held in the goddess’ hands. Sadly, the palace chapel and all the royal reception rooms are now a mass of huge looters pits.Given the wonders of the palace of Mari and the importance of this site, it’s disappointing that the destruction of the palace and the plundering of the site in search of tablets and other saleable objects hasn’t received more attention. The first explanation is that cultural destruction in the Middle East has been so widespread in recent years that it’s ceased to be news-worthy in all but the most extreme cases, which is a depressing thought. A second disadvantage Mari has over more high-profile sites, such as Palmyra, is that its buildings were made of mud, and not the classical stonework which produces photogenic ruins and screams its artistic worth to a general audience. Nevertheless, Mari deserves to be considered as a loss on the same scale as any of the more celebrated sites to have suffered during the Isis conflict.

Instead they rely on weights, handmade wooden goggles – and a single breath of air.But while the Bajau people’s talents have long been known, it was unclear whether the skill was the result of practice, as in the case of the excellent underwater vision of Thai “sea nomad” children, or the result of adaptations which have their roots in the Bajau people’s DNA.Now experts say they have the answer: over time the Bajau people have undergone natural selection, resulting in certain versions of genes becoming widespread – many of which are linked to biological changes, including having a larger spleen, that could help the Bajau to hold their breath underwater for many minutes at a time.The team say the findings could eventually prove useful in medical settings, potentially allowing experts to identify patients that might be at greater risk of death if they experience a lack of oxygen, for example during surgery.“There seems to be so much to learn from the Bajau and other ing populations about how the human body is able to react to oxygen deprivation, which is an important medical issue,” said Dr Melissa Ilardo, first author of the study who was at the University of Copenhagen at the time of the research. Writing in the journal Cell, the scientists reveal how they unpicked the mystery following a clue from previous research: species of seals which can e for longer have larger than expected spleens – an organ which, among its functions, can store oxygen-carrying red blood cells. As a result the team used an ultrasound device to measure the spleen in 43 Bajau people and 33 people from a neighbouring group of farming people, the Saluan.The team note the trend held regardless of whether the Bajau inidual was themselves a er, and even when factors such as age, sex and height were taken into account.Genetic testing revealed that certain versions of genes are more commonly found in Bajau people than would be expected, with many apparently linked to biological changes that could help iniduals cope with low-oxygen conditions. Among them is a form of a gene linked to an increased spleen size – an effect the team reveal is likely down to an increase in thyroid hormone levels. Crucially, a contraction of the spleen is one of the features of the so called “ing reflex” – a set of responses in mammals that occur when the head is submerged. A large spleen means even more oxygen-carrying red blood cells can be pumped into the circulatory system when the organ contracts, allowing iniduals to stay underwater for longer.Another is a form of a gene linked to a different feature of the ing reflex: narrowing of the blood vessels to the extremities, aiding delivery of oxygenated blood to organs such as the brain, heart and lungs.Further analysis by the team revealed that these genetic boons are not the result of chance, but evolutionary adaptations arising from natural selection. Stephen Stearns, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University who was not involved in the research, saidthe study adds to evidence for recent natural selection on certain genes in human populations – with previous examples including genes for lactose tolerance that cropped up with the advent of domestication of dairy animals, and genes for adaptation to high altitude in Tibetans and Native Americans in the Andes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb918081c01ee9b35027df4d8836d158155f125/0_10_2254_1352/master/2254.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=26b70aa735437fb27459730daeee1f44 1240w","title":"tess nasa planet exoplanet hunt satellite","story":"The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite will take an elliptical path around Earth to observe stars for evidence of exoplanetsNasa’s next planet-hunting mission has launched from Cape Canaveral air force station in Florida.The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess) took to the skies at 23.51 BST (18.51 EDT).

It is expected to discover thousands of previously unknown worlds, some of them potentially habitable, by detecting the small drops in light that occur when each planet passes across the face of its parent star. The launch was originally scheduled for Monday 16 April but delayed because of a potential issue with the rocket’s guidance system. In the event, the launch went without a hitch and Tess lifted off on a reusable SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Tess is comparatively cheap with a price tag of $200m (£140m) plus an additional $87m for launch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddd58a8750d2bd2195788c578b69025b42b16afc/0_315_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ac87cf9f032ed31c497b9b59f201be86 1240w","title":"cow could soon be largest mammal left due to human activity study says","story":"Researchers examining extinction of large mammals as humans spread across the world see worrying trend The cow could be left as the biggest land mammal on Earth in a few centuries, according to a new study that examines the extinction of large mammals as humans spread around the world. The spread of hominims – early humans and related species such as Neanderthals – from Africa thousands of years ago coincided with the extinction of megafauna such as the mammoth, the sabre-toothed tiger and the glyptodon, an armadillo-like creature the size of a car. “There is a very clear pattern of size-biased extinction that follows the migration of hominims out of Africa,” the study’s lead author, Felisa Smith, of the University of New Mexico, said of the study published in the journal Science on Thursday. Humans apparently targeted big species for meat, while smaller creatures such as rodents escaped, according the report, which examined trends over 125,000 years. In North America, for instance, the mean body mass of land-based mammals has shrunk to 7.6kg (17lb) from 98kg after humans arrived. If the trend continues “the largest mammal on Earth in a few hundred years may well be a domestic cow at about 900kg”, the researchers wrote. That would mean the loss of elephants, giraffes and hippos. In March, the world’s last male northern white rhino died in Kenya. But other research casts doubt on a continued shrinking of mammals, partly because of conservation efforts to stave off threats to wildlife such as climate change, loss of forest habitats, pollution and expanding cities.The International Union for Conservation of Nature chief scientist, Thomas Brooks, who was not involved in the study, said the projection of ever smaller mammals was “doom and gloom”. “Happily, I don’t think it’s very likely,” he said, adding that other research suggests large animals such as elephants are more likely to benefit in protected areas than smaller ones. And a red list of threatened species, maintained by the union, also lists some wild mammals roughly the size of a cow – such as the African buffalo or the brown bear – as unendangered. The Science study also excludes marine mammals such as the blue whale, the largest creature that has ever existed. It is listed as endangered on the red list but the populations are rising after a moratorium on hunting. Smith said “my optimist hat would like to say that it’s not going to happen because we love elephants”. But she said populations of large land mammals were falling and “declining population is the trajectory to extinction”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/353b4af183e1dee8bcd7f1d38ea7bf38306f7076/392_0_6493_3896/master/6493.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b8aebddf72e8254038d404b861532097 1240w","title":"long days journey into night review george costigan","story":"Citizens, GlasgowGeorge Costigan is magnificent as the patriarch of the fraught Tyrone family, imprisoned in a jail of their own makingThe Connecticut summer house of the Tyrone family in Eugene O’Neill’s autobiographical classic is usually realised as a solid architectural feature, bulky and permanent. Not so in Tom Piper’s design for Dominic Hill’s bruising revival, a co-production between Glasgow’s Citizens and Manchester’s Home. His set is a skeletal outline, just scaffolding, precipitous staircases and transparent walls. It looks provisional and unfinished – unattractive even – and it has an alarming effect. Because every time someone is out of the room and every time the conversation turns to them – which is nearly always – you’re convinced they’ll be able to hear. They seem certain to be within earshot of every heated exchange, sure to stumble in and make a volatile situation worse. “This is not a jail,” says patriarch James Tyrone at one point, yet his wife and sons seem to have imprisoned themselves in a place where they cannot escape each other. They are convicts held by their own family bonds. There is also an appropriate theatricality about Piper’s sketchiness – it’s the idea of a house, not the house itself – because the Tyrones are forever role-playing. It’s not just that James is a sometime stage star who has cajoled his eldest son, Jamie, to enter the profession. It’s also that all of them insist on masking their true selves. Where James acts big but has wasted his talent and Jamie walks tall but has underachieved, mother Mary is in denial about her morphine addiction, and younger son Edmund – a close fit for O’Neill himself – tries to conceal the symptoms of consumption. It’s the things they hide that make them at once needy and vulnerable, drawn to the very people who will tear them apart. In a play full of spite, recrimination and rage, there’s a surprising amount of hugging and cuddling that goes on in Hill’s production. It’s a constant push and pull of pain and affection. In a recent interview, Hill said the play was “essentially four tragedies in one show” and he duly fields four heavyweight actors (not forgetting a witty Dani Heron as the maid) to punch the drama home. Lorn Macdonald’s Edmund is wiry and resigned, the sickly and sensitive young poet who feels duty-bound to hold his dysfunctional family together, yet revealing his true colours in his moments of focused fury. As big brother Jamie, Sam Phillips has a fearsome presence, hunched like he’s ready to lash out, unyielding in his stare and with a demeanour as dry and bitter as the whiskey he knocks back in such quantity. With fingers crunched by rheumatism, Bríd Ní Neachtain’s Mary switches from the banal to the protective to the vindictive by the sentence. The more evasive – and more stoned – she becomes, the more she addresses her lines to the floorboards. Best of all is George Costigan as James, forever checking himself in his bouts of explosiveness, bringing his anger under control until it erupts irrepressibly again. It’s all delivered at a stormy conversational speed, lines frequently bursting out on top of each other, with an emotional exposure that can be excruciating to watch. In its sense of dark and relentless existential despair, it echoes Hill’s earlier productions, ranging from Crime and Punishment to the plays of Samuel Beckett bleak, feverish and compelling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/935f942135de59fe562d7bc1bf6a9feb09e9ae54/53_60_5799_3480/master/5799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=83a5c10007bf43c5a8cf31d50be777e2 1240w","title":"whats the best email service that doesnt scan emails for ad targeting","story":"Jim doesn’t want his emails scanned for targeted ads, but while there are ways to avoid it, surveillance-based advertising is rifeWhat’s the best free email service provider that does not scan or use the data in your emails for advertising? JimFree email services are usually paid for by showing you advertisements. Some email services scan your emails in order to show you personalised or targeted ads. You could argue that that’s a benefit, because you’ll see ads in which you might have some interest. You could also argue that your emails are private, so it’s an invasion of privacy. Either way, it’s different from scanning your emails to stop viruses and phishing attempts, which nobody wants to stop.There are several options, but the problem is bigger than you may think, and likely to get worse.When Google launched Gmail in 2004, it did indeed scan your emails for advertising purposes. You could only avoid it by using a paid-for version of the service. That changed last summer, when Google announced that it would no longer scan emails to tailor adverts.That didn’t mean you would get adverts picked at random. As Alex Hern explained here, “the adverts will now be targeted in the same way as other Google services, based on information gleaned from other activity on users’ profiles, such as their searches, browsing activity, and even physical locations”.Google has the world’s largest known tracking system, thanks partly to Google Analytics – which is used on far more websites than any Facebook tracker – and its DoubleClick advertising business. Add Google Search and it already knows so much about you that scanning your emails may well be superfluous. The good news is that you can delete a lot of it, with the help of a Guardian article by Dylan Curran: Here is all the data Facebook and Google have on you.The problem is that Google has lots of other reasons to read your email, and you may find some of them useful. For example, Google might tell you about traffic jams or flight delays, put appointments in your calendar, or offer to write quick email replies for you. These features involve AI software reading your emails, tracking your website visits, and your location. In the future, it may include information from home speakers (Google Home etc), household gadgets (Nest etc), fitness bands, smartwatches, cars (Waymo) and other connected devices.As AI gets smarter, there will be more and more opportunities for companies to track you, profile you, and help you.In other words, scanning emails to tailor advertising is a relatively minor issue in the great scheme of things. The larger problem is that the whole web economy is based on surveillance, and there’s very little you can actually do about it. Even if you try to stay anonymous and block cookies, you might be identified by techniques such as device profiling, fingerprinting, and AI systems that can recognise your typing.Neither of the two largest email services – Google’s Gmail and Microsoft’s Outlook.com – scans your emails for advertising purposes. If you want to avoid those, Zoho Mail is a good alternative. It’s primarily aimed at business users, and includes an online office suite and other features. It offers a free service with 5GB of mail storage space, so you can try it. You may find it’s worth paying €24 per year for 30GB of storage and other features such as domain aliases and Microsoft Active Sync support.ProtonMail, which is based in Switzerland, is one of the most privacy-conscious email services, and offers encrypted and self-destructing emails. However, it only provides 500MB of storage to non-paying users. ProtonMail Plus costs €48 per year for 5GB of storage, while ProtonMail Visionary costs €288 per year for 20GB. You’d be more likely to use this as a supplementary service than for all your emails.FastMail is a popular alternative, because it offers good support with no ads and no tracking, but it’s not free. The Basic service with 2GB of storage costs $30 per year, while 25GB costs $50 and 100GB costs $90 per year. There’s a 30-day free trial so you can test it first, and a migration guide to help you switch from another supplier.Most people now access their email service via a web browser. The pre-web alternative was to use an email client program to download new emails to your PC. If you use an email client then you won’t see any targeted adverts even if your emails are scanned.In the old days, email programs used POP3, the Post Office Protocol. The software downloaded your emails then deleted them from the mail server. This has mostly been replaced by IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), which downloads emails and leaves them on the server, unless you delete them deliberately. This means you can download the same emails to several PCs, or read them online with a different smartphone, tablet or PC, etc.Email programs have fallen on relatively hard times, and Microsoft has discontinued the Windows Live Mail program that was popular with Ask Jack readers, (although it still works). This is partly because devices may already include a mail app, and the Mail and Calendar app in Windows 10 is actually pretty good for most users. It supports multiple accounts, not just Outlook.com, and there are companion Outlook apps for Android and Apple smartphones.Alternatives include Mozilla’s free and open source Thunderbird, which runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux, and Windows programs such as Mailbird and eM Client. Mailbird Lite is free but you can get Mailbird Pro for $39 (or $19.50 at the time of writing). eM Client is free for non-commercial use but there’s a Pro version for £35.94.Business users tend to use Microsoft Outlook, which is one of the main Office programs. Outlook is not included in the Home and Student edition, but you could pick up a cheap version of Office 2016 Professional. Alternatively, you could subscribe to Office 365 Personal (£$59.99 per year for one user), or Office 365 Home (£$79.99 per year for five users), and download it. Each Office 365 user gets 1TB of storage, which makes it economical.The online advertising industry has a self-regulatory body called the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which offers advice to consumers. There’s also the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a non-profit organisation that describes itself as “the leading self-regulatory association dedicated to responsible data collection and its use for digital advertising”.The NAI has an “opt out” page, which sets an opt-out cookie that will be respected by NAI members. You will still see ads, but most will not be targeted ads. It offered me the chance to opt out of targeted ads from 90 members, including Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. You have to run it in every browser you use.You can also install the EFF’s Privacy Badger andor the open source Ghostery browser add-on. Privacy Badger tries to enforce Do Not Track if you have that turned on in your browser.Another idea is to use Firefox’s first-party isolation (FPI) feature, which Mozilla has adopted from the Tor browser. To turn it on, paste the following into the address bar and set the top preference to True:This may create log-in problems so it’s better to use an extension instead.A more practical idea, currently, is to use a Firefox container to isolate a particular site. Mozilla offers a Facebook Container extension, which makes it easy. The full Multi-Account Containers extension lets you keep any site – or group of sites – separate. It was designed to let you, for example, log into two or more different accounts on one service in the same browser at the same time. However, you could use a container to isolate Gmail or any other service.Have you got a question?

Here, writers, rangers and guides reveal their favourite spotsExploring Britain and appreciating the charms of its incredible landscape wasn’t always a top priority for me. Like many, I ignored what was on the doorstep as I rushed abroad. Which is nothing new. Celia Fiennes, an early pioneer of the Great British road trip, argued in the 17th century that we should all get out more and explore our homeland to “cure the evil Itch of overvalueing fforeign parts”.Her words ring truer now than ever. In my case, it took a trip to the other side of the planet to jolt me out of my complacency. Back from New Zealand, raving about its scenery, I was swiftly put in my place by a friend: “Haven’t you been to the Highlands of Scotland?”I hadn’t. But since then, I’ve been making up for lost time. Glen Coe, one Britain’s most dramatic landscapes, is popular, being only 30 minutes from Fort William but it’s big enough to feel properly wild, with empty Rannoch Moor providing a suitably contrasting backdrop to the mountains. Some friends and I recently enjoyed a night’s bivvy at the top of Buachaille Etive Mòr, the iconic mountain, but not without incident.A large bird, possibly in league with Satan, tore into our food supplies while backs were turned and then cackled at us all the way down the hill the next day. An incredible place for a night’s sleep but consider bringing a scarecrow. Humphrey Butler, publisher of the Joyously Busy Great British Adventure Map (£14.99, marvellousmaps.com)While northern Dartmoor is beautiful and hilly, the south is vast open moorland with no one around, and Duck’s Pool is one of its remotest parts. We call it the Bermuda Triangle because a lot of Duke of Edinburgh groups tend to get lost there – it’s featureless, boggy and sometimes misty, so can be disorientating and a bit scary. It’s not for the fainthearted and you need to know how to navigate, but the solitude and beauty make it a wonderful place – you can walk for several hours across open terrain.For me, it’s real Dartmoor, the high moorland that only hardier walkers see. It is the site of one of the first “letterboxes”. Letterboxing is a hobby dating back to the 19th century, where walkers follow clues and document their experience by stamping a visitor’s book kept in a “letterbox”. This letterbox is also the site of a memorial stone for William Crossing, who wrote Crossing’s Guide to Dartmoor. John Diplock, director Dartmoor-based activity operator Spirit of AdventureMam Nick is the road that climbs steeply from Edale to Mam Tor, deep within the Peak District national park. The road looks pretty straightforward in cycling terms but once the overhanging trees disappear, the road swings lefts over the Noe river and kicks up twice, hardly giving you chance to appreciate the spectacular views of the valley towards Win Hill. As the road snakes around, there are great views of Back Tor, Lord’s Seat and Kinder Scout behind you, if you care to stop for a breather.I first discovered this route on my bike in 2009 and was surprised how quiet it was compared with the hum of tourists and traffic at better-known Peak District attractions. The road is quiet throughout the week, and used mainly by ramblers and walkers at weekends. The only sound is the occasional call of a red kite or buzzard. Perhaps this is because you won’t find it written on a map – only locals call it Mam Nick.It is one of the toughest cycling climbs and, in the opposite direction, one of the most exhilarating descents in Derbyshire, on what is left of the abandoned Shivering Mountain (Mam Tor) road and the hair-raisingly steep Winnats Pass. Both roads boast amazing views back towards the Hope valley. Thom Barnett, founder of Sheffield-based clothing company MamnickFrom the start of the drive from Llandovery (the nearest town, 10 miles away), you sense that you’re delving deep into the rugged heart of the Cambrian mountains, a truly undiscovered gem of Carmarthenshire. Gwenffrwd–Dinas is an RSPB reserve, set up to protect the habitat of this ancient Atlantic oak woodland. It covers 600 hectares and is best experienced on a circular walk over a couple of hours.Initially, the trail runs alongside the still-infant Towy river, which, even in the driest season, roars across the rocks through the gorge from its source at Llyn Brianne as it cuts through the mystical oak and alder woodland. Use the steps cut out of boulders to take on the challenge of finding the well-hidden cave of Twm Siôn Cati (the Welsh highwayman). The feeling of tranquillity and isolation is spectacular, as red kites, pied flycatchers and tree pipits soar overhead. My favourite time in Dinas is May, when bluebells cast a violet haze over the valley.Alan Warner, countryside rangerThe Lakeland landscape can be ided into four parts, each feeling and looking quite different. The east shifts from scoured fells to woody limestone crags. The south-west is spacious, wild-valleyed and overlooked by the scowling buttresses of England’s highest mountains. The north-west is all jumbled, knuckled hills plunging to lake-floored vales. Then there’s the far north. There are no lakes here. No roads. Here the fells swoop and bulge, looking more Scottish than English. Unbroken by the gapes of crags, it’s Arctic-esque in the snow, pristine white rolling into white.You can lose yourself in 100 sq km or so. It is rampart-edged and slashed by valleys, with a high central keep. Caught within the encircling noose of roads are familiar fells – Skiddaw, Blencathra – and odd, unfamiliar names: Dead Crags, Thief Gill, Trusmadoor. It’s not impenetrable: the Cumbria Way splits on the way in, running around its centre like a moat. There’s even a bothy, in awesome isolation. I’d tell you where but no explorer wants directions.Hesket Newmarket lies to the north, a stone village with the Old Crown pub serving beers named after the local fells: Brim Fell, Old Carrock, High Pike.You couldn’t call any part of the Lakes a wilderness in itself. But by night, under cloud, or in winter, this is as wild a place as you’ll find. Simon Ingram, editor of Trail magazineLand’s End is one of the busiest places in Cornwall. Yet just a mile to the south along the South West Coast Path, and two miles north of popular Porthgwarra, is a bay of towering cliffs and caves that has two names: Nanjizal and Mill Bay. I love exploring this one-mile stretch of heathland and disused copper-mining shafts, along a mainly vertiginous footpath between two craggy granite promontories. These headlands are called Carn les Boel and Carn Boel, and the latter is my favourite, with remnants of an iron age settlement.Here I can be alone and observe seals, seabirds and peregrines rearing their young. On a clear day in May, you’re immersed in yellow gorse, orange lichen, aquamarine sea and the light and dark browns of granite glinting with feldspar. I often bring my walking guests to this bay, where we sit up high, on one side or the other of Carn les Boel, depending on the wind direction, watching the breaking waves with the sound reverberating around the bay. On extreme low tides, a walkable sand bar appears.Paul Simmons, founder of walkitcornwall.co.ukSprawled across the counties of Derry and Tyrone, the Sperrins are Ulster’s wildest land. The thickest sheets of the last ice age scoured these mountains into smooth undulations that banner the skyline. But don’t be fooled by gentle curves – the Sperrins’ heart is vastly bleak.Begin by following my favourite road through the foothills to Banagher Glen’s ancient forest of oak and ash. Here, having evaded St Patrick’s banishment, Ireland’s last serpent lurks in a pool swollen by the Altnaheglish and Glenedra burns. Climbing, the forest thins to mountain bog stretching across the uplands. The view pans to the Foyle Estuary. From Sawel, the highest peak in the range, you can gaze east all the way to the Mournes, and to Binevenagh on the north coast.Then turn around. There’s an aching wilderness of montane heath loping to the interior. With soaring buzzards to guide you, trek the lengths of eskers skirting peat-dark tarns and pools. If rough ground speckled with summer’s bog cotton keeps your eyes lowered, you’ll spy cloudberry and sundew among the coarse grasses and heather. But meadow pipit and wheatear will draw your gaze skyward to where a peregrine might slice it.Or you’ll stumble into the neolithic. Monuments, like Clogherny Wedge Tomb, cued by boulder erratics, litter the moorland with standing stones and circles. Heading west, past the Mullaghs, old bog roads descend to the glacial valleys of Glenelly and Owenkillew patchworked by gorse-seared hill-farms. Further pockets of forest shelter red squirrel and pine marten. As ravens acrobat in the wind, you could fancy you hear the howls of one of the last Irish wolves: mac tíre – aptly the son of the country – still haunting his tundral domain. Mary Montague, poet and author of Tribe (Dedalus Press, £9)If you want wild and remote, head to Handa, off the Sutherland coast. It’s not far from the North Coast 500 route, which is attracting growing numbers of visitors, but as an island we are one of the most isolated spots along this coastline. We look out of our bothy on to nothing, just mountains. Handa was last inhabited in 1847, when the islanders were relocated to Nova Scotia (voluntarily). Now it is an internationally important breeding site for seabirds, protected by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. Much of the island is surrounded by spectacular sandstone cliffs, which provide nesting sites for fulmars, kittiwakes, one of the UK’s largest guillemot colonies and 200 pairs of puffins. But on the east side, there are pristine beaches and sand dunes. Inland, the boggy moorland is home to the great skua, or bonxie as it’s known here. Most people arrive by ferry from Tarbet on the mainland (April-Sept, handa-ferry.com) but it is possible to kayak over and wild camp – if you check with the rangers first. • scottishwildlifetrust.org.ukCraig Nisbet, ranger, Handa island Don’t be put off by images of people and trains chuffing up Snowdon – Snowdonia is one of Britain’s greatest wildernesses, second only to Scotland’s Cairngorms in size and emptiness. My favourite part is the northern Rhinogs, where I lived for many years, and which has rugged bony peaks, high tarns and glimpses of the Irish Sea. is an abundance of bronze age sites linked by a prehistoric track, recently christened the Ardudwy Way, that once connected Ireland to Britain via the natural harbours of the coast.Standing proud like a crown of thorns is Bryn Cader Faner, a spectacular stone circle thought to be a prince’s burial cairn. From here, a network of lakes and tarns spread out and buzzards soar around the lonely granite top of Moel Ysgyfarnogod, or hare mountain. The glacial Cwm Moch valley drives a scar to the north, descending into the precipitous gorge of Llennyrch, among some of finest examples of Atlantic rainforest in Europe. Mosses and lichen drape the sessile oaks, bilberries abound and walkers can bathe in a Narnia of waterfalls and pools.Daniel Start, co-author of Wild Guide to Wales and the Marches (Wild Things Publishing, out 1 May, £16.99)Between the stunning north Norfolk coast, a stone’s throw to the north, and the commercialised Norfolk Broads to the south, lies the best-kept secret in Norfolk: the Bure valley, with the beautiful river Bure meandering through it. The clear waters are home to numerous aquatic creatures, from shoal upon shoals of silvery darting fish to lobster-like crayfish crawling across the river bed. You may spot the iridescent flash of a kingfisher patrolling his “beat” and in search of his next meal, the unmistakable stream of fizzing bubbles as the elusive otter speeds off into the distance, or a Chinese water deer at the river’s edge.A footpath runs alongside the river for about nine miles from Aylesham to Coltishall, and the Bure Valley Steam railway roughly follows the same route, so you can walk one way and get the train back. Much of the river is privately owned so there are few boats on it, and it’s quite possible to canoe for two days and not see another soul. To have that tranquility just two hours from London is incredible.

He said there would be no “capitalist restoration”, but promised to make better use of the internet and push on with “the modernization of our social and economic model”.He finished his address with the familiar rhetorical flourish: “Socialism or Death! We will triumph!”Raúl Castro, 86 – who stood down as president after 12 years in the office but remains first secretary of the Communist party – embraced Díaz-Canel, and gave his presidency a ringing endorsement.But he left no doubt where power still lies. In an uncharacteristically long speech, in which he repeatedly joked and went off script, Castro emphasised the need to fight corruption – and said he would stay on to guide his successor.An electronics engineer by training, Díaz-Canel became party chief in his home province of Villa Clara in the 1990s. In 2003, he was moved to be party chief in Holguin province, a centre of Cuba\u0027s burgeoning tourism industry and foreign investment. In 2009, he was summoned to Havana to be higher education minister, and in 2013 Castro appointed him as first-vice president. Since then he has stood in for Castro at political events, received foreign dignitaries and travelled abroad on behalf of the government.\u0026nbspDíaz-Canel\u0027s policy views remain mostly an enigma in a country where political campaigning is banned. On the one hand he is from a younger generation of leaders and has advocated modernising Cuba on the other he is a longtime Communist party apparatchik who is not expected to push for sweeping political change.As a young provincial party chief, he bucked party orthodoxy by backing an LGBT-friendly cultural centre in Santa Clara, reportedly listening to rock music and sporting long hair. At a national level, he called for more critical coverage of events in state-run media and broader internet access to open one of the world\u0027s least web-connected societies.\u0026nbspUltimately though, he appears to have earned Castro\u0027s trust by sticking to the party line on key political and economic issues, analysts say.While Díaz-Canel\u0027s public persona has been reserved, even dour, since he joined the national government nine years ago, residents in his home province of Villa Clara enthuse about him as a handsome, friendly man of the people who gets things done.\u0026nbspFuel was so scarce in the 1990s that he cycled to work wearing shorts instead of commuting by Soviet-made Lada like other party leaders, locals said. He has also been lauded for backing the Santa Clara culture centre at a time when homophobia was commonplace in the party.\u0026nbspA music lover, Díaz-Canel would reportedly bring his two children from his first marriage to the centre\u0027s youth events, dancing there himself in the evenings. ReutersCastro said he expected Díaz-Canel to serve two five-year terms as president before replacing him as first secretary of the party when he retires in 2021. “From that point on, I will be just another soldier defending this revolution,” Castro said.Amid the anachronistic language, there were signs that the new president was trying to forge a more modern image for the island’s ruling Communist party.  In what appeared to be a centrally managed information operation, the hashtag #somoscontinuidad (#wearecontinuity) was trending on Twitter.Internet access has expanded rapidly in recent years, but still remains below the regional average. All major international news websites can be accessed from the island, but government censors block critical blogs as well as webpages financed by the US state department.Communist party insiders say Díaz-Canel is aware of the economic benefits that wider internet access could bring the island’s economy, but fears the island’s political system could be overwhelmed.Under the Obama administration, USAid worked on developing a “Cuban twitter” aimed at fomenting unrest, and in January the US state department launched a Cuba Internet Task Force, which Havana sees as another attempt to undermine it.Díaz-Canel assumes office at a tricky time for the island after the Trump administration partially reversed the fragile détente announced by Castro and Barack Obama in 2014.The US has said Cuba was “responsible” for a series of mysterious health ailments affecting US embassy personnel on the island and has withdrawn more than half of its diplomatic staff. Washington has also warned US citizens not to visit the island – a move which is starting to choke off tourism revenues.Cuba’s main ally, Venezuela, is in crisis, and has heavily cut back on highly subsidized oil shipments to Cuba, upon which the island is heavily reliant.One of Díaz-Canel’s first tasks as president will be to unify the island’s byzantine dual-currency system. Analysts say that if not managed correctly, unification could provoke inflation which could hit the purchasing power of poorer Cubans who form the base of the government’s support. Unlike the carefully orchestrated election, currency unification has the potential to unsettle the island’s seemingly rock-solid political stability.Cubans were ided about the new president. “It’s not good news for me,” said Liliam Rodríguez, 33, who works as a tour guide. “He’s looks like he’s against the private sector in recent speeches.”“I don’t see him as a president,” Gerardo Cartalla, 56, a taxi driver. “In the current situation, I’d have liked Raúl to stay on as president. He’s somebody everybody respects.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04e5bb11b968afe273e38fedbf9d2c07213ac999/0_32_3472_2084/master/3472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ef3aa70101b67d1a6f300ee6ebb2b99a 1240w","title":"daphne project meps and authors crank up pressure on maltese authorities","story":"Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood and Tom Watson among those calling for more to be done to investigate murder of journalist Daphne Caruana GaliziaMalta’s government has been told to take urgent action to implement EU anti-money laundering rules, as MEPs rang the alarm about the dangers for journalists investigating financial crime following the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.The pressure intensified as the country’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, attended the Commonwealth heads of government summit in London amid further calls for him to provide reassurance that her death is being fully and impartially investigated. Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, called on the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, to challenge Muscat “over this very serious case … It is clear not enough progress has been made in the investigation of this terrible murder.” The intervention came two days after the launch of the Daphne Project, a collaboration between international media organisations, including the Guardian, that came together in response to her murder and have pledged to continue her work.The reverberations from the launch continued today across the political and cultural spectrums. Seventy-two MEPs, from six political groups, added their names to an open letter from 250 international authors, including Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood and Ian McEwan, demanding the removal from office of Jason Micallef, the chairman of Valletta 2018, the European Capital of Culture.In a letter to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, they accused Micallef of ridiculing Caruana Galizia. The commission itself piled pressured on Malta, one of eight EU member states that missed a deadline last year to put an EU anti-money laundering directive into national law. The EU directive, agreed in 2015, tightened up anti-money-laundering checks, requiring authorities to create registers that disclose the true owners of companies.The European commission said on Thursday that it was “in dialogue with the Maltese authorities” on the implementation of the rules. “There are ongoing infringement proceedings against several member states, including Malta, and we expect them to transpose the relevant EU rules urgently,” a commission spokesperson said.The European Banking Authority has also been asked to ensure “that financial institutions established in Malta satisfy the requirements laid down in union anti- money laundering and counter terrorism legislation,” the spokesperson added.Malta’s government announced last week a three-year strategy to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Police will be required to create an anti-money-laundering unit, while courts will be asked to do more to trace and freeze the proceeds of crime. Other measures include more staff at Malta’s financial intelligence unit and the creation of transparency registers to reveal the true owners of companies, trusts and charities.Transparency registers for companies will eventually have to be available to all citizens, not only government officials, after MEPs on Thursday backed measures to extend EU anti-money-laundering checks. Under the 2015 version of the law, which Malta has failed to implement, only national officials have access to a register of beneficial owners of companies, but the EU has now agreed to open these registers to journalists, NGOs and other citizens.The change, which will take at least 18 months to be implemented, has been hailed by anti-corruption campaigners as a big step in the fight against tax evasion, although trusts will escape scrutiny.Demands for transparency gained momentum after the Panama Papers exposed how secretive offshore companies were used to evade tax, shelter criminal funds and hide political bribes. Terror attacks in Paris and Brussels also exposed loopholes used by terrorists to move funds across borders.A fearless anti-corruption journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia’s reporting came to international attention with her exposes in the 2016 Panama Papers project.On 16 October the following year, the Maltese reporter was murdered by a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of her car.The Daphne Project was created to continue her investigations. It is a collaboration of 18 media organisations in 15 different countries, including the Guardian, Reuters, Le Monde and the New York Times.The project is the first to be led by\u0026nbspForbidden Stories, an international network of journalists who stand ready to take over when colleagues are silenced through imprisonment or murder.The project will publish a series of fresh revelations, setting out the dangers that alleged political corruption and poor controls on money laundering inside Malta pose to law and order in Europe.Separately on Thursday, MEPs backed a resolution calling for better protection of journalists and whistleblowers across the EU. The text, approved by 573 of the parliament’s 751 members, was drawn up largely as a response to the murder of Slovak journalist Ján Kuciak, who had been investigating extortion of EU agricultural funds by the Italian mafia, allegedly supported by local politicians. Kuciak and his fiancee, Martina Kušnírová, were murdered in their home, prompting Slovakia’s biggest street protests since the fall of communism and the resignation of the prime minister.In the resolution, MEPs said they were concerned about “the allegations of corruption, misuse of EU funds, abuse of power and conflicts of interest in Slovakia, which could cause the deterioration of democracy”.The European parliament’s special committee on financial crimes should “evaluate the allegations of VAT fraud, money laundering and misuse of European funds … with special regard to the work of Ján Kuciak and other investigative journalists,” it said.The parliament “is appalled by the fact that this is the second fatal attack on a journalist in the EU in the past six months after journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was assassinated”.The European parliament hopes to step up pressure on Maltese and EU authorities over the killing of Caruana Galizia. A special delegation of MEPs has called for meetings with the Maltese authorities and the European commission’s vice-president in charge of safeguarding the rule of law, Frans Timmermans.Sven Giegold, the German Green MEP who convened the group, has long accused the commission of not doing enough. “The European commission has to overcome its light-touch policy on the rule of law problems in Malta and urgently act as the guardian of European values,” he said.Malta’s “cash for passports” scheme is also under the scrutiny of EU authorities. There are fears that the country is selling EU citizenship to wealthy non-residents with little connection to the island. Campaigners are planning protests outside a gala dinner event to promote Malta’s “inidual investor programme”. Muscat is expected to attend the event in central London on Friday.

The transfers are detailed within a 120-page draft report by the Maltese financial intelligence unit seen by the Guardian.A fearless anti-corruption journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia’s reporting came to international attention with her exposes in the 2016 Panama Papers project.On 16 October the following year, the Maltese reporter was murdered by a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of her car.The Daphne Project was created to continue her investigations.

But the disclosure of a plan for a business relationship between the companies has raised new questions for both Mizzi and Schembri, whose offshore companies only came to light thanks to the Panama Papers investigation.Earlier the chair of a European parliament inquiry into the Panama Papers demanded Mizzi and Schembri resign or be sacked.“Minister Mizzi and Keith Schembri have to step down or be dismissed,” said Sven Giegold, one of a number of MEPs to have expressed concerns about the rule of law in Malta following the murder of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.“The European commission has to overcome its light touch policy on the rule of law problems in Malta and urgently act as the guardian of European values,” said Giegold, who was part of a European parliament inquiry launched following the Panama Papers.The latest disclosure follows months of research by the Daphne Project, an international alliance of media organisations continuing the work of Caruana Galizia, who was murdered in a car bombing in October.An email found in the Panama Papers describes how Schembri and Mizzi’s Panamanian companies, Tillgate Inc and Hearnville Inc, were intended to be used for an array of potential business opportunities, including recycling, gaming, infrastructure projects, fishing and tourism.Both Panama companies would be owned by separate trusts in New Zealand to which a distribution would be made “every now and again” according to an email in the leak. The beneficiaries of the New Zealand trusts were Mizzi and Schembri.The same email identified the “main target clients” of the Panamanian companies as 17 Black Limited and Macbridge Limited. Caruana Galizia had hinted that she was investigating 17 Black in two blogposts on her website early last year.The draft report by the Maltese financial intelligence unit alleges that 17 Black received $1.4m in payments from an offshore company in the Seychelles.The report claims that transactions relating to 17 Black were flagged by the US financial intelligence unit as possible “shell company activity, suspicious wire transfers and money laundering”.A separate payment of $200,000 was made to 17 Black by a different company belonging to a local agent for an energy infrastructure project, according to the report.There is no evidence that any payments were ever ultimately made from 17 Black to either of the Panamanian companies. The Panama Papers suggest that as of December 2015 efforts were being made to open bank accounts for the Panamanian companies in the Bahamas. In February 2016 Caruana Galizia began writing about the offshore structures.He said: “My companies make dozens of business plans such as these. However, it is a fact that neither 17 Black nor MacBridge ever became clients of my business group, and no transactions were ever recorded with these companies, or with me personally. “I have no knowledge of the transfers referred to, nor any knowledge of the alleged payment.”Schembri has previously responded to questions about the Panama Papers by saying that he was following advice from professional financial advisers, and that nothing those advisers did was illegal.He added that “the Panamanian company Hearnville Inc held no bank account and received no money from any source”, and said an international audit firm had found the structure’s financial statements were presented fairly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5a00879b0b0fdd2953922b81e494cd685f5284a/0_57_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b67d1a91c16e5705a0ec15333aa47384 1240w","title":"north korea wants complete denuclearisation says seoul","story":"South Korea’s president says Pyongyang has not attached any conditions such as US troop withdrawalNorth Korea has expressed a desire for the “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula without attaching preconditions such as the withdrawal of US troops, the South Korean president has said.The statement, unconfirmed by North Korea, comes before a summit between the leaders of the two countries on 27 April, to be followed in May or June by a meeting between Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, and Donald Trump.The US president on Wednesday pledged to meet Kim “in the coming weeks” but said he was prepared to walk away if the talks were not fruitful.The key question at any summit between Trump and Kim is whether the North Korean leader is serious about dismantling his regime’s nuclear weapons, and what he would demand from the US in return.The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, told reporters that North Korea had not “attached any conditions that the US cannot accept, such as the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. All they are expressing is the end of hostile policies against North Korea, followed by a guarantee of security.”Robert Wood, the top US envoy to the UN-hosted conference on disarmament, said the country would maintain a “maximum pressure campaign” to convince North Korea to denuclearise, even as preparations for the summit continued, adding that it “has had an important impact in the North’s decision to return to the table”.At a news conference on Thursday, before a meeting next week on nuclear nonproliferation, Wood said the US welcomed Pyongyang’s willingness to talk about denuclearisation, and called the summit planned for late May or early June a “momentous time”.Meanwhile, the European Union imposed travel bans and asset freezes on four people suspected of “deceptive financial practices” to benefit North Korea’s arms programme. The EU did not name the four, but said they brought the number of people on its North Korea blacklist to 59, as well as nine entities. It has also mirrored the UN’s sanctions list, which covers 80 people and 75 entities.The anti-nuclear weapons group that won last year’s Nobel peace prize has said it is “very supportive” of the proposed summit, after months of heightened tensions between Washington and Pyongyang.The executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said mutual threats between the two leaders had made the risk of nuclear confrontation “really dangerously high”. Speaking to reporters, Beatrice Fihn said if the summit in late May or early June made progress on disarmament, “we’ll definitely applaud it … Every step forward is positive.”There has never been a summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, though Bill Clinton came close to agreeing to meet Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2000.“As you know, I will be meeting with Kim Jong-un in the coming weeks to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” the US president told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Wednesday. “Hopefully, that meeting will be a great success and we’re looking forward to it.”North Korea has defended its weapons programmes, which it pursues in defiance of UN security council resolutions, as a necessary deterrent against perceived US hostility. There are 28,500 American troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war.North Korea has said over the years that it could consider giving up its nuclear arsenal if the US removed its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear deterrence umbrella from South Korea and Japan.The North may have found a way to make a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a missile, but firing one at the South is likely to provoke retaliation in kind, which would end the regime.\u0026nbspPyongyang has enough conventional artillery to do significant damage to Seoul, but the quality of its gunners and munitions is dubious, and the same problem – retaliation from the South and its allies - remains.In the event of a non-nuclear attack, Seoul\u0027s residents would act on years of experience of civil defence drills, and rush to the bomb shelters dotted around the city, increasing their chances of survival.South Korea announced on Wednesday that it was considering how to convert a decades-old armistice with North Korea into a full peace agreement. Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Trump confirmed this week that the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, had travelled to North Korea to meet Kim, paving the way for Trump to hold the summit.The mission, which came shortly after Pompeo was nominated as secretary of state, was the highest-level meeting between the two countries since 2000, when Madeleine Albright met Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang. It also marked the first time Kim Jong-un had met a senior western official."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f25e53176648c27748ffc56201dd7a0d4433ce0/0_294_5031_3019/master/5031.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=753f2b464146f4376fe921880da0eddd 1240w","title":"queen suggests prince charles should be next commonwealth head","story":"Wish expressed as leaders of member states meet in London for biennial two-day summitThe Queen has expressed her desire for Prince Charles to succeed her as the leader of the Commonwealth, voicing her views the day before top government officials from the 53-nation body meet at Windsor Castle to discuss the issue.Her unusually candid declaration was made at what will almost certainly be her last attendance at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (CHOGM) as she welcomed presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers to the two-day biennial summit at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.“It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity to future generations and will decide one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949,” she said.Decision day, according to Downing Street officials this week, is likely to be on Friday, when the leaders retreat to Windsor Castle in Berkshire without aides or advisers present to mull over issues confronting the organisation, not least the vexed question of its next leader.The position is not hereditary and not automatically held by a British monarch, and there has been speculation for years over whether Charles would become its titular head. It seems unlikely Commonwealth leaders will defy such a directly expressed wish of their host, especially the day before the Queen’s 92nd birthday on Saturday.The Queen, who presides over the summit but does not take part in discussions, revealed her hand at the first CHOGM to be held in London for 32 years. As she no longer goes abroad, the current summit will almost certainly be her last. Charles has represented her at recent CHOGMs.A 53-gun salute in London’s Green Park marked the formal opening of the gatheringwith a ceremony in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace. Forty-six government leaders from the 53 nations attended, along with foreign ministers. They arrived in motorcades driven on to the palace forecourt where they were greeted by a guard of honour formed by the Coldstream Guards, whose officers and soldiers lined up in their scarlet tunics and bearskins. The flags of all of the Commonwealth’s 53 member states were flown, as senior royals including Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, turned out to greet them.Inside the ballroom the opening ceremony was hosted by the BBC presenter Reeta Chakrabarti. The singer Emeli Sandé sang the national anthem and a group of Commonwealth singers performed Natasha Bedingfield’s song Unwritten.The prime minister, Theresa May, paid tribute to the Queen. “Over many years you have been the Commonwealth’s most steadfast and fervent champions,” she said.Charles had earlier addressed leaders and highlighted his Commonwealth credentials. “For my part, the Commonwealth has been a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember, beginning with my first visit to Malta when I was just five years old,” he said.“I pray that this Commonwealth heads of government meeting will not only revitalise the bonds between our countries, but will also give the Commonwealth a renewed relevance to all citizens, finding practical solutions to their problems and giving life to their aspirations. “By doing so, the Commonwealth can be a cornerstone for the lives of future generations, just as it has been for so many of us.”Joseph Muscat, Malta’s prime minister and the Commonwealth’s chair-in-office, hinted at rubber stamping the Queen’s wish for her son to succeed her when he becomes king. He told delegates of the vigour with which Charles participated in Commonwealth affairs. “We are certain that, when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth,” he said The prime minister of Grenada, Keith Mitchell, said he had no difficulty with Charles taking over. “It would be good news, the Queen herself does very well and certainly we have been fortunate to have her stable leadership over this period. But having the Prince of Wales would certainly not be an unhelpful act at this point in time,” he told the BBC’s World at One. Charles later joined the Queen for a lunchtime reception in the palace’s 1844 Room, held for new government leaders including New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa. Welcoming delegates, Theresa May spoke of the shared values of the Commonwealth, the challenges of climate change, the health of the oceans, trade and cyber security. There was no mention of the issue that has dominated headlines since the Commonwealth leaders arrived in the UK – Britain’s treatment of the Windrush generation. During the summit leaders will be urged to follow the UK work in reducing plastic waste in the seas. The UK is due to consult on proposals to ban plastic straws and cotton buds as part of effforts to tackle the pollution issue. May said she would rally member states. “The Commonwealth is a unique organisation with a huge ersity of wildlife, environments and coastlines,” she said.The Queen told delegates: “It remains a great pleasure and honour to serve you as head of the Commonwealth and to observe, with pride and satisfaction, that this is a flourishing network.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb5168ed88e600d37a65f2186c5f372a3a9ed94e/0_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c9f3be56456404b1837f9208a14f4147 1240w","title":"swaziland king renames country kingdom of eswatini","story":"King Mswati III declares name change 50 years after independence from British ruleThe king of Swaziland, Africa’s last absolute monarchy, has announced that his country has changed its name to the Kingdom of eSwatini to mark 50 years since independence from British rule.Meaning “place of the Swazi”, eSwatini is the Swazi language name for the tiny state landlocked between South Africa and Mozambique. Unlike some countries, Swaziland did not change its name when it gained independence in 1968 after being a British protectorate for more than 60 years.King Mswati III declared the name change during independence day celebrations at a packed sports stadium in the second city of Manzini. “I would like to announce that Swaziland will now revert to its original name,” he said, wearing red military uniform. “African countries on getting independence reverted to their ancient names before they were colonised. So from now on, the country will be officially be known as the Kingdom of eSwatini.”The name Swaziland angers some citizens as it is a mix of Swazi and English.The move had been mooted for years, with lawmakers considering the issue in 2015. The king had used the new name in previous official speeches.Mswati, who was crowned in 1986 aged 18, rules by decree. Political parties are banned from taking part in elections and only candidates approved by chiefs loyal to the king can stand for office. The country has a population of about 1.3 million people.The name change could mean the country’s constitution is rewritten, as well as changes for the royal Swaziland police force, the Swaziland defence force and the University of Swaziland.After independence, Rhodesia became Zimbabwe, Nyasaland became Malawi, and Bechuanaland became Botswana."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccc9c0aa4b90bd02125cbd3e8e2d86d20beb0338/216_524_4571_2743/master/4571.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0e76b0255948f14a0e30107d7f375c84 1240w","title":"time 100 list new zealand pm jacinda ardern praised as political prodigy","story":"Ardern breaking boundaries ‘in a world that too often tells women to stay small, keep quiet’, says Sheryl Sandberg on list of most influential peopleNew Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has been named by Time magazine as one of the top 100 most influential people in the world.At 37 Ardern is the world’s youngest female prime minister and was elected to govern the country in October last year, after leading the beleaguered Labour party for just two months.In the magazine, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer and author of Lean In, described Ardern as a “political prodigy” who was “changing the game” and inspiring women and girls around the globe.“Just 11 countries out of almost 200 are led by a woman. Let that number sink in. That’s how hard it is for a woman to rise to lead a nation,” Sandberg wrote. “At a time when conservative politicians are ascendant across Europe and the US, she’s proudly progressive – with a raft of plans to fight economic inequality, address climate change and decriminalise abortion.“In a world that too often tells women to stay small, keep quiet – and that we can’t have both motherhood and a career – Jacinda Ardern proves how wrong and outdated those notions of womanhood are.”In late January, Ardern announced she was four months pregnant with her first child, putting her on course to become only the second prime minister in history to give birth in office.In a short video accompanying Ardern’s Time post, the prime minister said she thought her humble upbringing, rather than her age, was what helped her connect with people. “I hope that when I am a 50-year-old woman, that I have still the same level of empathy and compassion that I have as a 37-year-old woman,” she said.At the Commonwealth Summit this week, Ardern met her fellow political trailblazer, the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, who was also named by Time as one of the top 100 most influential people of 2018.Asked by Time to write about Trudeau, with whom Ardern appears to have a warm friendship and shared political ideals, Ardern said Trudeau’s name would be etched in the history books for shifting the political landscape at such a young age.

Video: Margo O\u0027Donnell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBig Tom at the funeral of Irish country singer Larry Cunningham in Co. Longford in 2012. Photographer: Dara Mac DónaillTHE IRISH TIMES Nobody could fill a hall at the height of the showband era like the late Big Tom McBride. Long queues would form outside the local ballroom when Big Tom and his band, the Mainliners, came to town. Generally, dancing was 9pm to 1am, with a relief band getting proceedings underway.In the 1960s, as Ireland was slowly changing, the ballrooms replaced as dance venues the parish halls, which had been frequently run by the local parish priest, whose task sometimes was to guard against the perils of close dancing.Not so the ballrooms, where close dancing ceased to be a moral threat.Many of the ballrooms were exotic, by comparison, and they introduced an element of glamour in a grey Ireland. Their opening saw the emergence of the showbands, vocally more sophisticated than the parish hall band, with the singers and musicians sporting bright suits and modern hairstyles. Big Tom and his band, the Mainliners, became the country stars of that new world. When he recorded the sentimental Gentle Mother in 1967, it became an instant hit, reaching the coveted number one spot in RTÉ Radio’s top 10 records.An overnight success, he went on to enjoy a huge following at home and among Irish emigrants.Yet the showband business was run on an informal basis, with mainly cash transactions.In the midlands, a young businessman, Albert Reynolds, later to become Taoiseach, opened a series of ballrooms. He was later spoken of as a good promoter the band was always paid and a hot meal provided before going on stage. In Tralee, Co Kerry, a ballroom attached to the Mount Brandon hotel, opened by then Taoiseach Sean Lemass in the 1960s, was a hugely successful venue for Big Tom. It had a chandelier and a large balcony. Like the other ballrooms, though, it sold nothing stronger than soft drinks.The women queued on one side of the hall and the men on the other. If there was a large crowd, there was a rush to ask a woman to dance. This was the entertainment world dominated by Big Tom, Dickie Rock, Brendan Bowyer, Brendan O’Brien and Philomena Begley in the sixties and seventies.With the exception perhaps of Bowyer, nobody rivalled Big Tom as a crowd-puller. His country audience followed him faithfully, sometimes driving miles to see him play, not least in the summer when the venue could be a marquee in a country village where the local carnival was being held. He understood his audience. He came from Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, and knew rural Ireland. He had spent some time as an emigrant in London. His songs were about love affairs, many of them ending in remorse and melancholy, old Irish ballads, and some modern songs. Despite being the lead singer and playing the guitar in the band, he was intensely uneasy with fame.I interviewed him many years ago when he was playing at the Festival of Kerry at the height of his fame.He was a courteous, diffident, shy man. He told me he found public recognition difficult.He had just turned down his own series on RTÉ television at the time because the station wanted to use professional session musicians rather than his own band members, all of whom hailed from his native Monaghan.“They would be the best in the business,’’ he said. “But they would have no interest in country music.’’Big Tom and his music were lampooned, of course. In an Ireland struggling for sophistication, having watched too much television, Big Tom and his likes were not cool.His country fans dismissed the lampooning, followed him in the dancehalls and bought his records in abundanceIn recent times, he would get due recognition on a country music special on The Late Late Show, presented by Ryan Tubridy, who helped the visibly ailing Big Tom to the microphone to sing his trademark Four Country Roads. Some 400,00 people emigrated from Ireland between 1951 and 1961 alone, most of them poorly educated and ill-prepared. Many headed for British building sites and factories. “They were a silent generation,’’ the novelist John McGahern later wrote,”and they left in silence.’’They followed Big Tom when he came to London to play in the then thriving Irish dancehalls, such as the Galtymore in Cricklewood, the National in Kilburn, and the Gresham in Holloway Road. They played his records at home and sang his songs at Irish emigrant gatherings, the poignancy of his voice in harmony with the bitter-sweet experience of forced emigration.It is very easy today to dismiss all this as crass sentimentality. It would be wrong, because it was no such thing.Big Tom’s songs and music were a lifeline for a dispossessed people, forced out of their own country, which could not even provide them with the basic human right of a job. Many of those songs were melancholic. But our history of forced emigration is laced with melancholy.A good friend, John Mulrooney, from Sligo, was a close friend of Big Tom. Some years ago, we said we would meet up at one of his concerts. We never did.I regret that now.The Ireland which made Big Tom a country star is gone. The ballrooms have long closed and the showbands are no more.

Both of which were shot down by the EU, according to the report. Photograph: PA The European Union has rejected British proposals for avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland according to the Daily Telegraph. British prime minister Theresa May’s plan for avoiding a hard border was subjected to “a systematic and forensic annihilation” this week, the paper has reported. “It was a detailed and forensic rebuttal. It was made clear that none of the UK’s customs options will work,” a source told the paper. Last month, Ms May said remaining in the EU customs union would “not be compatible with meaningful independent trade policy” and proposed two options for avoiding a hard border while retaining the ability to set tariffs. Ms May has ruled out remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit, instead proposing two alternative models. The first, a “customs partnership” would see Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods entering the country en route to Europe and applying its own tariffs to imported goods destined for the British market.The Telegraph reports that this was rejected by the EU on three grounds – that the EU could not allow a country outside its supervision mechanisms and IT systems to level duties and that it unfairly placed the burden of collecting tariffs on business. It was also rejected as implementing the scheme on the EU side of the channel would be too expensive. The second, a “customs arrangement”, envisages technological and administrative measures ensuring that trade with the EU remains frictionless, with additional measures for Northern Ireland such as allowing small traders to operate across the Border unchecked.This too was rejected by EU states who are said concerned about setting precedents for ‘turning a blind eye’ with countries like Turkey, while it was pointed out that other ideas like having authorised economic operators fell short of what was needed to avoid a border. At a briefing in Brussels last week, one ambassador put up his hand and asked if anyone could tell him how to open an export-import business in Ireland, “because it is going to be a great business if there are no customs controls”, according to an account obtained by the Telegraph. A powerful cross-party group of MPs are set to force a vote in the House of Commons next week calling on Ms May’s government to seek to remain in a customs union with the EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland.The motion, which has been tabled by 10 select committee chairmen including Conservatives Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, will be debated next Thursday.A vote on the motion will be non-binding but the debate will increase pressure on the British government to keep the customs union option alive following a massive defeat on the issue in the House of Lords on Wednesday.The motion notes the importance of frictionless trade with the EU for British manufacturing and “further notes that the free circulation of goods on the island of Ireland is a consequence of the UK and Republic of Ireland’s membership of the EU customs union”.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3467508.1524160246!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mps call on may to seek to remain in customs union with eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May: The prime minister has ruled out remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit. Photograph:  Jack Taylor Getty Images A powerful cross-party group of MPs are set to force a vote in the House of Commons next week calling on Theresa May’s government to seek to remain in a customs union with the European Union in order to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The motion, which has been tabled by 10 select committee chairs including Conservatives Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, will be debated next Thursday.A vote on the motion will be non-binding but the debate will increase pressure on the government to keep the customs union option alive following a massive defeat on the issue in the House of Lords on Wednesday.The motion notes the importance of frictionless trade with the EU for British manufactures and “further notes that the free circulation of goods on the island of Ireland is a consequence of the UK and Republic of Ireland’s membership of the EU customs union”.It recalls the British government’s commitment in last December’s joint report with the EU “to the maintenance of North-South cooperation and the all-island economy on the island of Ireland, that the Belfast Agreement implemented in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 should remain a fundamental principle of public policy, and to the continuation of unfettered access for Northern Ireland’s businesses to the whole of the United Kingdom internal market”.In a joint article for HuffPost on Thursday, Ms Morgan and Labour’s Yvette Cooper said MPs had a responsibility to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland and the role of the all-island economy in strengthening the peace.“Ministers have rightly insisted both that there cannot be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, or between Northern Ireland and Britain either.” But as the Northern Ireland Committee concluded last month, there are no technical solutions, anywhere in the world, “beyond the aspirational”, that would remove the need for physical infrastructure at the border. The police have warned that even customs cameras to check number plates at the border may become a security target for dissident groups,” they said.The prime minister has ruled out remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit, instead proposing two alternative models. The first, a “customs partnership” would see Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods entering the country en route to Europe and applying its own tariffs to imported goods destined for the British market.The second, a “customs arrangement”, envisages technological and administrative measures ensuring that trade with the EU remains frictionless, with additional measures for Northern Ireland such as allowing small traders to operate across the Border unchecked.There is some tension within the government between advocates of either model, with eurosceptics fearing that a customs partnership could lead to a customs union in all but name.Next week’s vote comes ahead of amendments to a trade bill and a customs bill calling for Britain to remain in a customs union with the EU and will offer an indication of how many Conservatives are willing to break ranks on the issue.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"there s a hole and someone went out southwest pilot tells air traffic control","story":"  April 18, 2018Plane violently depressurized after fragments from the explosion burst through window   April 19, 2018With horrifying suddenness, an engine exploded and a passenger was partly sucked through a broken window Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.Email cannot be used.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ Email cannot be used.

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”Email cannot be used.

The biggest set of economic decisions over the course of the next few years are going to be taken in the Brexit negotiations and whatever deal we end up with. And then we will adjust to the impact of those decisions in order to keep the economy on a stable path.”Earlier on Thursday retail sales data for March came in worse than expected. This followed a bigger than anticipated decline in inflation in March.“We have had some mixed data,” Mr Carney said.“On the softer side some of the business surveys have come off. Retail sales have been a bit softer – we are all aware of the squeeze that is going on in the high street. We’ll sit down calmly and look at it all in the round.”Allan Monks of JP Morgan said the implication of Mr Carney’s words were that the Bank could pause in May and hike later in the year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They expect to discover hundreds of new exoplanets within that larger set.It was the latest successful launch for SpaceX, a company founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk that has in recent months deployed a fleet of communications satellites and hurled the world’s most powerful rocket into space.In addition to sending TESS into space, SpaceX caught a tumbling rocket component in a seaborne vessel.Nasa\u0027s canny decision to commission sumptuous vintage-inspired posters by Seattle design firm Invisible Creature has firmly placed space travel back where it belongs: in the imagination of travellersIt is particularly fitting that the Nasa commission went to Don and Ryan Clark, who have been running Invisible Creature since 2006, undertaking projects for the likes of Nike and TargetWe were ecstatic, just because our grandfather was an illustrator at Nasa for 30 years, says ClarkThe artwork harks back to the Jet Age-era posters commissioned by Howard Hughes\u0027 Trans World Airlines and its rival United in the 1950s and 1960s, when the work of David Klein (for TWA) and Stan Galli (for United) glamorised and essentially branded this new age of air travelIt doesn\u0027t matter that Nasa has no plans for a Grand Tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and UranusIf global travel is for daydreamers, going beyond the atmosphere is for true space cadetsThe Falcon 9 rocket’s first stage landed on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean named “Of Course I Still Love You”.As SpaceX has demonstrated the potential for privately funded space flight, the Trump administration has pledged a renewed commitment to space exploration.Donald Trump signed an executive order reviving a defunct national space council and has mused repeatedly about sending American astronauts back to the moon and, eventually, to Mars.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the people Dr Ilardo met told her he once stayed underwater for 13 minutes while hunting.The Bajau village of Jaya BaktiJaya Bakti homes from the waterA Bajau villager demonstrates the use of traditional wooden gogglesA young Bajau girl looks on in excitement as her father, a traditional Bajau er, returns to Jaya Bakti from a two-week fishing tripThe population was interested in learning about their genetic heritage, and Dr Ilardo used a portable ultrasound machine to measure spleen size in 59 Bajau.She then measured spleen size in 34 people from a neighbouring village inhabited by non- Bajau people so she could make a comparison.When she took her data back to Denmark to analyse, Dr Ilardo found Bajau people had spleens around 50 per cent larger than their neighbours. Spleens are involved in the so-called “human e response”. When a body is submerged in cold water the heart rate slows, blood vessels in the extremities shrink and the spleen contracts.This contraction injects a spurt of additional oxygen-rich blood cells into circulation, allowing the body to survive for longer underwater. Dr Ilardo and her collaborators estimated the enlarged spleens of the Bajau could provide them with around 10 per cent more blood cells than someone with a normal-sized spleen.As well as measuring spleen size, Dr Ilardo took spit samples from the study participants so she could investigate the genetic basis for the differences she was seeing. She identified several genes that were observed far more frequently in the genomes of Bajau participants, including one – PDE10A – that is involved with the production of thyroid hormone, which in turn is associated with spleen size.We believe that in the Bajau they have an adaptation that increases thyroid hormone levels and therefore increases their spleen size, said Dr Ilardo. It\u0027s been shown in mice that thyroid hormones and spleen size are connected. “If you genetically alter mice to have an absence of the thyroid hormone T4, their spleen size is drastically reduced, but this effect is actually reversible with an injection of T4.This is the first adaptation for ing ever observed in humans. Previous work appeared to show that sea nomad children had superior underwater eyesight, but those results have since been disproved.The findings were published in the journal Cell. Despite initially warning Dr Ilardo against undertaking the work due to the likelihood she would find no significant results, her supervisors Professor Eske Willerslev and Professor Rasmus Nielsen think her findings are significant for a number of reasons.This is the first time that we really have a system like that in humans to study, said Dr Nielsen. “Nature has made experiments for us that tell us how humans react and adapt genetically to a whole new set of physiological conditions, so that we can explore and learn much more about the interaction between genetics and physiology.Understanding the genetics underpinning the Bajau’s abilities could even have applications in medical research – specifically for those trying to treat the condition of acute hypoxia, when body tissue experiences a rapid depletion of oxygen.There is also a fundamental need to understand the ersity of genes found in the world’s indigenous populations, said Professor Willerslev.This really tells us how valuable and important indigenous populations are around the world that are living extreme lifestyles, in terms of understanding the function of various genetic traits and finding the underlying genetic background for various physiological traits, he said. Most of these populations are completely understudied, and I think there is a huge benefit, not only potentially to them, but also to the rest of mankind by actually paying some attention to them.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The most important thing is not to react on such and such instrument at this stage, but to be sure that we share the same goals and to have a joint political objective,” he said.“You will notice we don’t lack work to do, and we don’t lack the will either.” The two leaders both agree that the eurozone needs reform but disagree on the specifics. They are hoping to form a united front by June, when a summit of eurozone countries will be held alongside the European Council summit.Mr Macron wants a European Monetary Fund that would help invest in the eurozone’s less rich economies, but German conservatives are worried that they might foot the bill of any economic risks taken by other states.The French president has also previously proposed the eurozone having its own finance minister and a separate budget for the shared currency area.Ms Merkel is understood to be more positive on the prospect of a eurozone banking union, but cooler on other proposals.In a speech in the European Parliament on Tuesday Mr Macron warned that Europe is in a state of “civil war” and was afflicted with a “fascination with the illiberal”.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

weather forecast: Above-average temperatures are forecast through the weekendSummer forecasts are starting to emerge after one of the worst winters for more than five years saw Britain beset by freezing temperatures and snow into March.The erratic weather followed a La Nina cooling of the eastern Pacific Ocean \u0026ndash a phenomenon linked to extreme weather events around the globe.La Nina, meaning Girl Child in Spanish, is the follow-on from a warming pattern of waters around South America, the so-called El Nino, or Boy Child.A huge El Nino set in off the coast of Peru during in 2015 and was one of the strongest ever recorded.Its La Nina counterpart followed last autumn and triggered a swing to cooler than normal temperatures across the east Pacific.The event, which is now coming to an end as sea temperatures return to normal, is linked to warmer than average weather in North America, Asia and the Far East.While its effects in the UK are the subject of debate, previous La Ninas have been followed by notably warm and even record-breaking summer seasons.A powerful event in 1976 was followed by the hottest summer ever recorded in the United Kingdom with 30C-plus temperatures recorded for 16 days in a row in London.A strong La Nina became established across the eastern Pacific in 1989 after which came the heatwave of 1990 which brought record August highs of 37.1C (98.8F).Lots of people are out and about taking advantage of the sunny British weather as the UK currently experiences its warmest weather of the year.
