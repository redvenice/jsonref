members warned: \u0027Increased ambiguity about a requirement to self-isolate upon testing positive will also disproportionately impact vulnerable sections of the population.\u0027They also raised concerns about the consequences of removing access to free testing and called for \u0027clear and consistent\u0027 messaging to the public about the ongoing risks.The group said getting rid of free testing would make it harder for people to take precautions and \u0027may also increase anxiety among those who have found testing reassuring after possible exposure, particularly those who are or live with someone who is clinically vulnerable\u0027.\u0027Some people may also take the removal of free and accessible testing as a signal that they should continue to attend workplacessocial gatherings while showing Covid symptoms, as these become conflated with other symptoms of respiratory illness such as influenza,\u0027 the group added.In response to this, Sage suggested the Government should take \u0027various proactive measures\u0027 to address the culture of \u0027presenteeism\u0027 at work, including encouraging people to work from home when unwell and providing \u0027adequate\u0027 sick pay for employees.The group also emphasised the importance of public messaging as a way to reduce the impact.\u0027Lifting of restrictions should be accompanied with clear and consistent messaging about the scientific rationale and continued benefit of protective behaviours to reduce transmission,\u0027 Sage said.Public messaging should also be employed \u0027to stress the different needs and risk appetites of others,\u0027 it added.\u0027This should help to improve understanding of the continued need and adoption of protective behaviours by different groups and reduce the risk of social tensions, abusive incidents and stigma towards minority groups,\u0027 the group said.Sage also suggested that health authorities should take over the responsibility of public messaging, based on studies that show people have higher confidence in experts and are less likely to follow rules if trust in a government is low.\u0027This could improve adherence but is dependent upon consistency across organisations, including central government,\u0027 it said.Covid restrictions had been due to expire on March 24, but Mr Johnson told MPs he expects they can end a month sooner if the data continues to be encouraging.It means in just over two weeks England could be returned to levels of freedom enjoyed before the pandemic, for the first time since restrictions were brought

Pini added that Vlhova also wants to make sure she has time “to go home and share this medal with those closest to her.” Vlhova had already sat out the super-G and the opening downhill training session. The Alpine combined is scheduled for Thursday. (AP) Netherlands, China, Canada and South Korea will contest it.Saudi Arabia’s Fayik Abdi finished 44th, but Haiti’s Richardson Viano failed to finish. Benjamin Alexander, Jamaica’s first ever Alpine skiier, was slowest of those to complete the course, finishing more than a minute behind the gold medallist, Switzerland’s Marco Odermatt. Ivliev, Sighel and Sitnikov were the top three in the first semi-final, with Nikisha fourth.With only around 300m to go, however, Öberg forged clear as Tandrevold came to a virtual standstill. She recovered enough to start gliding, but skier after skier passed her and another Norwegian, Tiril Eckhoff, took bronze before Tandrevold crossed the line in 14th place.  Such was the sudden nature of the turnaround that the Eurosport TV commentator called Tandrevold as the bronze medallist, not realising his mistake until minutes after the race. Tandrevold immediately collapsed to the snow - not a particularly unusual sight after cross-country and biathlon races - but needed lengthy medical attention before getting to her feet and being helped away.  “She tried as hard as she could and she did everything to follow Elvira,” Norway team doctor Lars Kolsrud said. “She went empty on top of the hill and hardly got to the finishing line. When she got there she was very sad and sorry, because she lost this medal and she was all empty for power. She was not unconscious but she was very, very exhausted. She said nothing except: ‘I’ve spoiled everything’.” Tandrevold, a relay gold medallist at the last three world championships, finished fifth and eighth in the sprint and inidual Olympic races during the week and had been hoping to take part in two further events. “We will talk to her and see her and see that she get the proper food and proper drink tonight and then the days that follow and we have to decide whether she should compete anymore,” Kolsrud said. (Reuters)That was a spectacular collapse in the shooting from JT Boe of Norway, who missed seven shots on the range and paid a heavy price ... it sounds like he had the worst of the conditions, with the wind dropping in time for his French rival to nail his shooting. As a result, Finland top Group C with three wins out of three. Johannes Thingnes Boe nails five out of five on his first visit to the range. The usual suspects are there: Quentin Fillon Maillet of France, Maxim Tsvetkov of ROC.  Fillon Maillet gets back in Boe’s face with five out of five ... but he’s 41sec off the pace. The next closest athlete is Eduard Latypov of ROC, 1min 21 sec down.In case anyone is not clear on the format of the ice hockey competition, by the way, thanks to Pawel Smrek for emailing in: So it’s all to play for, even for the teams that are left trailing in their respective groups. USA currently top Group A, with Canada second. ROC and Denmark occupy the top two spots in Group B. And Finland and Sweden lead the way in Group C.A thick layer of fresh snow covered much of the man-made course as the race got under way, making the going heavy and punishing those who missed shots and had to endure a penalty loop of 150 metres. With the staggered start based on the results from Friday’s sprint, Roieseland, 31, was not initially troubled as she hit her first five shots. A miss by Öberg allowed Dorothea Wierer to slide into second place early on but the Italian was unable to exploit a miss by the Norwegian leader at the third shoot, missing two of her own five shots to fall more than 90 seconds behind on the fourth lap.  With her biggest rivals struggling, Røiseland was never going to turn up her nose at such an opportunity and she flashed off her last five shots in perfect fashion before skiing away from the range, safe in the knowledge that only a broken pole or ski could keep her from gold.  Behind her the battle for silver gathered pace as the rest of the pack followed Wierer on to the range, with the 22-year-old Oeberg making a stunning comeback to retake second place ahead of the final lap. Norway’s Ingrid Tandrevold was hot on her heels as the two exited the final shoot, but Oeberg quickly dropped her to secure the silver medal, her second at the Games after second place in Friday’s sprint. Tandrevold’s challenge fell apart completely on the final lap, allowing Eckhoff to glide past and take the bronze, with Tandrevold eventually finishing in 14th place before collapsing. She needed medical attention before being helped off the course. (Mitch Phillips, Reuters) “They’re not really thinking about the doping issue or what medal they’ll get. They’re more interested in the medal ceremony and wondering whether they will be able to collect their medals while in Beijing,” said Japan’s chef de mission, Hidehito Ito.  The Japanese skaters came third in the team figure skating event on Monday, behind Russia and the USA, before news broke of a positive doping test involving 15-year-old Valieva, part of the winning ROC ensemble. Valieva’s future at the Games is due to be decided at a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) hearing on Sunday, with a decision expected on Monday.  Teams from the USA and Japan are also awaiting the results. “The athletes are a bit disappointed that they have to wait for the medal ceremony to happen – they had really worked so hard for that medal,” Ito said.  The chef de mission said the Japan Olympic Committee would accept the results of the doping case. “It’s a shame that the timing of the medal ceremony hasn’t been decided yet, but it doesn’t concern Japan, so we would like to refrain from commenting on Valieva’s case,” Ito said. “We believe that the relevant organisations will take the necessary steps so we won’t comment on the issue.” (Sakura Murakami, Reuters) Wierer misses once and she is going to be under pressure in the silver medal position ... and in fact she is bumped down to fourth!

Photograph Liam BurkePress 22Nearly two years on from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, Adare GP Dr Pat Morrissey, who did not give vaccines to patients in his Co Limerick\u0026nbspclinic, still believes the vaccine\u0026nbspcampaign was a lie, with money and greed at its heart.“It’s the greatest power-grab ever, the greatest consolidation of power and wealth ever,” says Morrissey, who insists that he is not against vaccinations but rather against those that are still experimental.Morrissey is one of the 250,000 adults in the State who chose not to get vaccinated despite restrictions, or\u0026nbspbeing blamed for spreading the virus, or for prolonging the epidemic.The January 21st lifting of almost all Covid-19 restrictions was greeted with bewilderment and anticipation by a weary vaccinated public, but it was also greeted as a vindication by those who refused to take the jab. Their stance has often put them in conflict with friends, family and employers.Breandán Murray (49), an IT project manager who lives in Dublin, was one of those unconvinced by the mRNA vaccine. He might be persuaded to get vaccinated if Novavax is released next year, a vaccine using an older technology.“I am not anti-vaccination, but I am anti the vax mandate. My wife has the vaccination, I drove her to the centre get it,” he said. “My reluctance to take mRNA vax is nuanced. My doubts grew as the rollout happened both for its effectiveness and the side effects.“Since I returned to Ireland from Belgium in August, I’ve found it hard to explain this to some friends – the issue has become so polarised. I was called an anti-vaxxer, and I took exception to that. I have my three children all vaccinated.”Locked awayDavid O’Neill (64) from Waterford has been vaccinated against most things, but similarly believes the mRNA vaccines are untested. “I was waiting for Novavax or Valneva but events have moved on,” he said.A chartered engineer, O’Neill said the unvaccinated were seen as a “dangerous minority”. A friend had sent out a group email saying the unvaccinated should be “locked away”, not knowing that he was one of them.Saying he could not make sense of the regulations, he went on: “The vaccines have had a beneficial impact, but the other side is what are the dangers of them? Nobody is actually giving any real assessment of the risk.”“There are very few journalists interested in hearing the opinion of people like me,” said Eamonn, a father of four from Kildare, who believes that his opinions are moderate, but never reflected during the pandemic.He, along with others who spoke to The , said the mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna, were untested technology, a viewpoint that is not shared by most people in medical science.Eamonn said he has neurosarcoidosis, an inflammatory condition of the brain, and is wary of taking the vaccine as a result. “Very little has been done in terms of research. The vaccines have not been around long enough.”John C*, a 41-year-old man living in Dublin, had a heart defect since birth and pericarditis in 2010. He too demurred on taking the vaccine for health reasons.“So I decided with a brand new vaccine it would be more sensible to wait three to five years before taking it as that would be enough time for accurate safety data to be compiled and published. By the way, this is the first time I have declined a vaccine in my life.”Second shotLaura*, a woman in her 30s who grew up in south Dublin and works for a multinational company, said she declined the vaccine as a result of her mother getting pericarditis after her second shot.Before the Covid pass was lifted, her wedding was in jeopardy because she was unvaccinated, but she would not budge.“I had Covid and recovered, it was two days of a bad flu. I have had pneumonia before and the pneumonia was a lot worse for me. I am pretty well read up on everything Covid. I have listened and read from both sides the last two years. Immunology 101 would say natural immunity always wins over vaccinated immunity. So why would I now get three injections for a virus I already had? I am not some anti-vaxxer, I regularly got the flu vaccine in work over the years.”Kevin*\u0026nbsp(30s), a gym trainer from north Dublin,\u0026nbspstressed that he was not against the Covid-19 vaccination, describing it as a “hugely helpful tool in reducing severity of outcomes for those most at risk from Covid”, but said\u0026nbsphe is young and healthy and saw no reason to take it.He never asked his gym clients for their Covid-19 passes and they never asked him for his.The Omicron-caused infections surge copperfastened his vaccination views. “It’s now January 2022 and I simply don’t see the benefit of getting vaccinated given my age and health profile. I am of no greater threat to anyone that is double vaccinated or boosted. We can all catch it, we can all spread it.”Lia, a 36-year-old scientist and PhD candidate based in the west of Ireland, is one of those who\u0026nbspcannot take the vaccine because of a reaction to polyethylene glycol, a component of the vaccine, which can lead to anaphylaxis.“I had to weigh up the risk benefits. We lost a family member in 1998 to anaphylaxis. I am not anti-vaccine. Myself and my partner are vaccinated for everything under the sun. I would have taken the vaccine if I could have done.“Honestly, it’s disheartening that people online push the narrative that there’s no medical reason not to avail of the vaccine. It’s simply untrue.”Her inability to take the vaccine came at a personal cost at Christmas when she was unable to take her children to see Santa Claus.LockdownA health researcher, who provides data for Nphet and is in her 50s, said she had come to the conclusion that the vaccines were useful for those in the vulnerable age category, but not for her.“You have to have evidence-based accountability. It was clear from early on who was at risk. I was never at risk. It was never backed by the evidence.“If all that money and focus was put on protecting the vulnerable we would be in a better place. The sooner we get rid of the masks the better. They were never supported by evidence either.”The unvaccinated still face limitations, especially on foreign travel which requires a recovery certificate, not an inconsiderable restriction. But otherwise they will be free to go about their lives.Nevertheless, the overwhelming feeling is relief. “To be honest I just want to forget about Covid now. I’m sick of being called an anti-vaxxer when I’m nothing of the sort,” says Bob*, an ultra-marathon runner.Back in Adare, Dr Morrissey insists that face mask rules in school should be dropped immediately.“How does this make sense? So, people can go to a nightclub and be close and personal with each other, while young children are stuck in school wearing masks for eight hours a day, impeding their learning, impeding their ability to learn and develop social and linguistic skills?”The move to vaccinate children from five upwards has been “appalling”, he says.“There is no benefit, zero benefit\u0026nbsp– what are they to gain from it, and you are depriving them . . . Omicron is the natural vaccine. I’ve had dozens and dozens of children I’m aware of who’ve got it – it’s a sniffle, it’s a high fever for one or two days and then they’re over it.“They are not going to get myocarditis, they’re not going to develop a heart attack, and we don’t have to worry about their future fertility.”TreatmentDr Morrissey is facing an investigation by the Medical Council for promoting and treating his patients with ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which have been debunked by others as treatment for Covid-19.Defending his decision to use ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as “early treatments”, Morrissey said the patients he has treated were those who had come to his door “looking for another way, and I offered them another way and none of them have died”.“They refused to take the injection that they were being threatened with literally every time they came near the door of a clinic or a surgery,” he says, declaring: “Albert Einstein said that blind obedience to authority is the greatest enemy of the truth, and I can see that they want to throttle the truth.”*These names have been changedEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"richard o halloran says he felt abandoned by irish government while detained in china","story":"Richard O’Halloran with his wife Tara, and his three daughters and son: He said he ‘turned in on myself’  during his detention and ‘did not feel the Irish Government were doing anything to help, even though they said they were’.  Photograph: Tara O’HalloranTwitterPA Irish businessman Richard O’Halloran, who was detained in China for three years, has spoken of his difficulties in achieving assistance from the Department of Foreign Affairs, and what he described as an apparent initial hesitance of Minister Simon Coveney to become involved.Mr O’Halloran and his wife, Tara, said on Saturday\u0026nbspmorning that most of the “heavy lifting” in terms of securing his release was done by themselves through Mr O’Halloran’s working with the courts in China and Ms O’Halloran’s speaking out to media in Ireland.The businessman was caught up in a\u0026nbspdispute between the Chinese authority and Min Jiedong, the chairman and main shareholder of the Dublin firm China International Aviation Leasing Service, where Mr O’Halloran is a director.The dispute centred on Min’s raising of funds from Chinese investors in a crowdfunding scheme to buy an Airbus aircraft. This predated Mr O’Halloran’s employment with the company.Mr O’Halloran said when he was initially prevented from leaving China after a three-day business trip in February 2019, he was told by the Irish Consulate in Shanghai they could not help him\u0026nbspbecause it was a commercial matter.“I obviously went to the Irish Consulate in Shanghai,” he said. “I was told it was a commercial matter and they couldn’t engage. So at this point I thought the Irish Government, the consulate, the embassy network was supposed to help Irish citizens abroad, and I was being told it was a commercial matter, we cannot engage. And I was saying, what part of the police being involved is a commercial matter?”Mr O’Halloran said that this stance continued for the first year of his detention and it was his view that Mr Coveney had been advised against getting involved.Both Mr O’Halloran and his wife\u0026nbspsaid the advice from diplomatic channels had been to not seek publicity about his detention, for fear of making things worse.We are so blown away by the lovely messages of kindness and support ❤️ It has been the happiest reunion for our family and we are truly grateful. Richard is so happy to be back home where he belongs at long last. Thank you so much everybody from Tara and Richard— Tara O’Halloran (@tara_ohalloran) Mr O’Halloran said some of his own legal advice had been not to speak out and if he did so his “safety cannot be guaranteed”.Ms O’Halloran said during the first year of his detention, they had not even told friends and said that, as a result, some assumed the couple had separated.After the first year Ms O’Halloran went public and organised a campaign to draw up support for her husband’s plight.HealthMr O’Halloran outlined to Brendan O’Connor on RTÉ Radio One how his health declined as he confronted the prospect that he might not see his wife and family again until a lease deal with an aircraft had resulted in sufficient earnings to settle matters in China.Mr O’Halloran said he began drinking too much in his hotel - where he stayed during his three year detention - and that he lost 20kg in weight, ending up in a hospital where his heart stopped and he had to be resuscitated.“I turned in on myself” he said. “It was an extraordinary low point . . . I turned completely in on myself . . . I did not feel the Irish Government were doing anything to help at the time, even though they said they were.”He said he owed it to his “beautiful wife, my kids” to recover and he decided that “if I am going to get out of here, I am going to have to do it myself”. He decided to work with the court in China to find a solution.“All the heavy lifting had been done by me right up to let’s call it the end of November, December,” he said.Mr O’Halloran also paid tribute to the businessman Ulick McEvaddy who agreed to become a director of Mr O’Halloran’s company, a factor he said provided comfort for Mr Coveney’s participation in subsequent efforts to secure his release.“There was obviously dialogue between Simon Coveney and his counterpart in China. Simon did read me a letter that his counterpart wrote to him and it was made clear their court had to go through a process, it had to and that was fair enough and I had to deliver what I was being asked, which I did and more.”Passport controlHe said there was a moment of anxiety when he was leaving China as passport control officials asked him to wait while they made checks. Mr O’Halloran said he was talking on the phone to his wife at the time and it was a very difficult moment as he had over the years been turned away twice.While the couple welcomed the diplomatic pressure applied by Mr Coveney and the Irish Government, they said they did not feel it had been appropriate to pay tribute to the Chinese government for being helpful in trying to bring the issue to an end after Mr O’Halloran was released.Ms O’Halloran said “thanking the Chinese was in kind of poor taste given what Richard had to go through and the ordeal that we had all faced for three years and I just certainly did not think it was necessary for our family. That is my personal opinion.”Mr O’Halloran said “obviously the Irish Government did do stuff behind the scenes. I certainly thank Simon Coveney for what he did. In the end, I mean, I am here.“There is evidence of some heavy lifting, I don’t know what. Obviously he was liaising with his counterpart but I don’t know what was done.” Mr O’Halloran also said he wanted to make it clear there was no payment or guarantee made by the Irish Government.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit uk signals it could accept checks on goods for northern ireland","story":"UK foreign secretary Liz Truss meeting European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic for talks in central London  Photograph: Rob PinneyPA Wire The UK has signalled it could accept customs controls on goods destined only for sale in Northern Ireland, its first significant concession during months of talks with Brussels over post-Brexit trading arrangements.Liz Truss, foreign secretary, wants to resolve the dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol - part of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement - which has soured relations between London and Brussels as well as convulsing politics in the region ahead of elections on May 5th.Ms Truss, who travelled to Moscow on Thursday for talks on Ukraine, believes Europe needs to work together to tackle the geopolitical crisis in the east. “Liz thinks western democracies need to work together,” said one ally.London has so far insisted that suppliers of products shipped from Britain intended for sale in Northern Ireland only should no longer have to fill in customs forms as dictated by the protocol.But British negotiators on Friday told their EU counterparts they could accept controls - though far fewer than under existing arrangements or reforms proposed by Brussels.The verbal offer was considered so sensitive it has not yet been provided in written form.The proposal came during Ms Truss’s third in-person meeting with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, held in London. British officials said there was “a constructive atmosphere” at the talks.After the meeting the pair issued a joint statement, saying they agreed “on the need for progress in their talks in the interest of people in Northern Ireland, to stay in close touch and that officials will continue intensive discussions in the coming days”.Ms Truss’s team declined to comment but one ally said she had “put forward a series of constructive proposals to address problems created by the protocol” and to bring the two sides closer together. There was no single “offer” and the UK’s fundamental negotiating position had not shifted, they added.Under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, all goods going from Britain to the Northern Ireland must follow EU customs and health rules to avoid a trade border on the island of Ireland itself.However the Demcratic Unionist Party (DUP) pulled its First Minister out of the Northern Executive over its disputed contention that the trade border in the Irish Sea impacts on the North’s constitutional status within the UK.DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson’s has said his party would not renominate a First Minister following May’s elections unless there was progress in dealing with unionist opposition to the protocol.The commission in October had offered to create “red and green channels”, in which goods that were clearly destined to remain inside Northern Ireland, such as supermarket deliveries, would only need to provide a single customs form per load. London has now agreed to discuss this idea, but wants declarations to be even less detailed.The two sides have yet to make progress on the trickier issue of health checks on animals and food entering the region. The commission claimed its offer would reduce them by 80 per cent but the UK is unconvinced.Any customs agreement could be ratified by a meeting on February 21st of the Joint Committee, which manages the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland. The talks are then expected to be paused during the election campaign.EU diplomats gave a cautious welcome to the UK proposal. “It’s a positive move but we are not rolling out the red carpet yet,” said one. “There is still a long way between the two sides.”Any concessions made during the talks with Brussels could anger Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, who dislike the protocol negotiated by Boris Johnson, the prime minister, because it puts a trade border in the Irish Sea - within the UK’s internal boundaries. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022 How is Brexit affecting you?

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireA new plan for how the country will deal with the Covid-19 pandemic will be mapped out in a forthcoming Government meeting, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.Speaking at the One Ocean summit in Brest, France, on Friday, Mr Martin said he had held informal discussions with other heads of state at the conference and the picture around the pandemic was positive.“We’re going to have a meeting shortly, a Covid meeting within Government, just to try to take stock of the situation and map out the situation for the remainder of the year. And we just had a preliminary chat with some of the heads of state earlier this morning in terms of how things are going in their country,” he said. “The World Health Organisation seemed pleased with developments as were some of my colleagues.”Mr Martin said the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) will meet in the coming weeks to discuss the remaining restrictions including the wearing of face masks.He said, however, that it is his personal view that people should continue to wear masks on public transport and in retail outlets.“Nphet will be meeting in respect of the mask mandate and so on by the end of the month,” he said. “Irrespective of whether it is mandated or not, I would recommend that people would wear masks in retail and public transport for some time yet.“It’s a personal view I have. Decisions will be taken on the mandatory nature of masks if they are no longer necessary, they are no longer necessary and people will no longer have to wear them. “But we’ve learned lessons too from Covid and I think we need to adapt some of them. Particularly in the winter periods when viruses are stronger and more dangerous.”VariantsMr Martin said that, overall, “the news is good” in respect of the Omicron variant.“We have to be mindful of other variants. I think the emphasis now is to make sure we continue our investment in public health and that we have systems in place that are resilient and adaptable to any future outbreaks and maybe of other variants.”He said that was also the case in relation to the structures in place for future vaccination campaigns.“It also relates to the vaccination structures that we have so that we can respond again and are in a position, particularly towards the latter part of the year, in terms of vaccinating particularly the more vulnerable groups in our society. Niac is looking at that whole vaccination issue and whether or not we get to a situation where there would be an annual Covid vaccine.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"new orleans prepares for return of mardi gras after hurricane and covid","story":"Masked characters and elaborate floats are a big part  of Mardi GrasThere was plenty of water on Bourbon Street last week as a major storm that hit the southern United States led to widespread rain and unusually cold temperatures. However it didn’t stop the spirit of New Orleans, which is gearing up for the high points of its traditional Mardi Gras carnival after a year which has seen it hit by both Covid and a hurricane.Mardi Gras itself, which takes place on Shrove Tuesday – the day before the start of Lent – is not until the beginning of March. However, the carnival season begins on January 6th, so it runs for longer this year as Easter is late.Already work crews are erecting seating platforms across the city for the hundreds of thousands of people, locals and tourists alike who will flock to New Orleans in the coming weeks.The Mardi Gras festivities still face some problems. A shortage of volunteer police officers has affected the plans and is likely to lead to some parades being altered or shortened. Mardi Gras in February 2020 was considered in some quarters to have acted as a Covid-19 “super-spreader event”in the region, and city authorities in New Orleans remain conscious of the dangers. Vaccination certificates are policed strictly at the entrances to most restaurants and bars as a condition of entry. Mardi Gras last year was cancelled due to Covid. And as one local said while waiting for the start of a parade last weekend, “the spirit of the city is just waiting to explode”. Gulf coastThe Mardi Gras festivities have been going on in New Orleans since the 1850s. The original organisers came from Alabama, where similar events could be dated back to about 1700, when, it is claimed, a French Canadian explorer threw a party after landing on the gulf coast.Initially in New Orleans the social organisations or clubs – known as “krewes”– which hosted the parades tended to be the preserves of the elites in the city.Later on the excluded groups – whether they be Irish, Italian, German, African American or women – started their own similar organisations.Elaborate masks – as well as costumes – have been associated with Mardi Gras since long before they became obligatory with the arrival of Covid. In New Orleans a significant portion of the year would seem to be spent by organisers planning the host of parties and parades to run from just after Christmas to Lent, as well as working on an extraordinary array of floats and outfits.One member of the krewe of Endymion, who spoke to The , said its parade would involve about 3,000 people. And it won’t be without celebrity endorsement.The post-parade “Endymion Extravaganza” in the Caesars Superdome in the city will feature American pop icon Diana Ross and the band Maroon 5.Last weekend it was the turn of the 900-member Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus to take to the streets with their distinctively science fiction and particularly Star Wars-related parade.It was what is known as a walking parade featuring about 100 contraptions and devices which were variously pushed, pulled or pedalled rather than involving motorised floats. Some were elaborate and sophisticated. Others less so. Overall there was a light hearted, tongue-in-cheek element to the proceedings.There were legions of imperial star-troopers and assorted impromptu light sabre duels on the streets.And every hair stylist in Louisiana must have been booked out all day as dozens of lookalike Princess Leias with the trademark double-side buns – a la Carrie Fisher from the original 1977 Star Wars movie – paraded through the French district. Hurricane KatrinaThose who have not been back to New Orleans in several years – particularly since Hurricane Katrina 16 years ago which saw 80 per cent of the city flooded – will notice many changes.There are more tall buildings and, it may be the onset of age, but Bourbon Street sounds and seems louder than before. However, the traditional live jazz clubs can still be found on Frenchman’s Street.Mardi Gras in New Orleans remains one of the great interactive experiences. The parades are not just viewed as a spectacle. Many in the crowds dress in the traditional green, purple and gold costumes, wear face masks and hats and compete for the beads thrown from passing floats.Covid may have changed the world. And New Orleans is still recovering from a hurricane that hit only last August, 16 years to the day after Katrina. Workmen could still be seen fixing some house roofs last weekend. But the focus of the city is on partying.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ghost sightings soar covid spooks believing paranormal","story":"The spectre of the pandemic has cast a dark shadow over the lives of everyone. But for some, it is more than just a metaphor.Ghost sightings have soared in the past two years, with paranormal investigators besieged with reports of hauntings, unexplained knockings, text messages from beyond the grave and poltergeist activity.“We would say that during the last two years we have experienced an increase in the number of inquiries received, probably in the order of two to three times,” said Andy Wilson, of Paranormal Research Investigators UK.“We did see an increase in cases reporting poltergeist-type activity from the full range of the social spectrum - for example, the unemployed, retired nurses, lawyers, ex-special forces.”Hayley Stevens, a paranormal researcher and regular contributor to the BBC Radio 4 podcast Uncanny, also noticed a similar phenomena, with enquiries rising from once or twice a month to almost daily.“In the week of the first lockdown I started to get a small trickle of contact, but as it went on I got more and more emails, which I thought was weird,” she said.“I was curious to see whether it was happening to other people too, and when I talked to friends in the paranormal community they were reporting the same, being contacted by lots of people having strange experiences.”Cases that have emerged in the past couple of years include the Shrubbery Hotel in Ilminster, Somerset, where footsteps, disembodied voices and hair pulling were reported.The Wahlberg family in Oldham, Greater Manchester, claimed to have seen shadowy figures, strange smells and noticed objects going missing. Naomi Hudson Reed, an interior designer, heard ghostly footsteps in her home at Clyst St Mary, Devon.It is not the first time that cataclysmic world events have unleashed an avalanche of unexplained encounters. Ghost sightings also soared during the Second World War, while the Cold War coincided with a rise in reports of flying saucers - dubbed “UFO flaps” by experts.Psychologists believe that “magical thinking” - which includes paranormal beliefs, superstitions and conspiracy theories - increases during periods of uncertainty, when people feel vulnerable and out of control.It seems the psychological impacts of Covid have created a perfect spectral storm.Professor Chris French, head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths, University of London: “Not surprisingly, mental stress had been very high throughout the pandemic.“We’re understandably focusing on Covid but we’ve already had the effects of Brexit and climate change, which is enormously worrying for lots of people, then along comes Covid as the cherry on the top of the cake.“I’ve never known a period of such prolonged and ubiquitous stress in my lifetime.”The parallels with Covid and ghosts are unmissable. A dangerous unseen force that can creep into the home, bringing fear and potentially death. It is little wonder that confronted with such an existential threat, thoughts have turned to the spirits and the afterlife.Experts say many people have been forced to face their own mortality for the first time, as well as the deaths of family and friends.“I think in the West we have this privilege of being removed from the reality of death, so I think when they are confronted by it in something like a pandemic, it can be quite jarring,” added Ms Stevens.“You’re at home and you start thinking about the biggest questions of life and death.”Professor Caroline Watt, the Koestler chairman of parapsychology at the University of Edinburgh, said she had noticed a “huge increase” in interest on her online parapsychology course during the pandemic.“There is certainly academic research that shows when people are living in uncertain or dangerous environments, their paranormal and superstitious beliefs tend to be higher compared to those living in safer environments,” she said.“And the psychological reason for this is probably that these beliefs can give a person a reassuring - but false - sense of control. The same might be said about religious beliefs.”The coronavirus pandemic also has unique features which experts think might explain the spooky goings-on. Lockdowns, quarantine and self-isolation left people alone in their homes for extended periods, allowing the creaks of floorboards or banging of pipes to take on a new sinister significance.Even ghost hunters believe some of the increases can be explained away by this change in behaviour.“Our view is that levels of anxiety had increased due to the pandemic, there was more time to experience what appeared to be strange events at home because people were not going out,” added Mr Wilson.“The proliferation of TV programs sensationalising the paranormal could also have been a factor.”Investigators also noticed a trend in paranormal activity linked to domestic abuse, which rose during the pandemic.Some “hauntings” were found to be staged by abusive partners to instill fear, a phenomenon which Mr Wilson and his partner Nick Howe have dubbed “paranormal by proxy”.Studies have also shown that the pandemic led to sleep disturbances and increased nightmares, leaving people fatigued and more likely to attribute absent-mindedness to ghostly activity.Accidentally placing the car keys in the fridge or stacking cans precariously in a cupboard can quickly become a poltergeist incident in the troubled mind of the anxious, medicated or sleep-deprived, say experts.The University of Arizona found that people who reported greater levels of Covid-related stress were more likely to have bad dreams about sickness, death, war, separation and the apocalypse.There was also an increase in sleep paralysis, where an inidual wakes but cannot move, a state often associated with seeing or feeling a ghostly presence in the room.Ms Stevens added: “We know that when people are isolated it can cause them to have a sense of a presence. We’ve even seen it in astronauts, or people on remote mountains.“It can be really unsettling having things happen at home. We used to have wooden cladding on the outside of the house and when the sun came up the front door literally popped. It sounded like someone throwing rocks at the door, and it made all sorts of groaning noises.“One of the things I recommend is keeping a ghost diary and making a note of when things are happening, as you will start seeing patterns emerge, such as a neighbour getting home from work, which might be causing unexplained noises.“I’ve been doing this since I was 16 and I\u0027ve witnessed all sorts of paranormal experiences which can be explained by things like a badger underneath someone\u0027s shed, or even carbon monoxide or sewer gas.”Just like previous times of upheaval, the trend for strange sightings has crept into other areas of the paranormal. According to the National UFO Reporting Centre, the number of unexplained flying objects in the US rose seven-fold between 2019 and 2020 - from around 1,000 a year to 7,200.Scotland also saw more UFO reports than usual, recording 47 in 2021, compared to 13 in 2019. Northern Ireland also saw double the number of sightings between 2019 and 2021.As well as increased stress, experts said lockdown restrictions in the pandemic gave more people more time to scan the night sky.The last two years have also seen a rise in conspiracy theories, with large numbers of people now believing in “The Great Reset”, a global elite plan to use Covid to establish a communist world order and enslave humanity with vaccines.The Capitol riots in January 2021 were partially inspired by the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory, which holds that Democrats are trafficking and torturing children so they can harvest a chemical to help them to live longer - run from a pizza shop in Washington.Prof French added: “Paranormal belief, traditional superstitions and unfounded conspiracy theories all tend to increase when we are going through periods of uncertainty when you feel that things are out of your control.“It makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. Our brains have evolved to pay attention to any threats in the environment.“The pandemic was a very traumatic time for a lot of people, people couldn’t visit their dying relatives, so I am not really surprised that we see this rise.”Tellingly, as the pandemic recedes and life gets back to normal, the number of paranormal sightings is declining.“I’ve noticed a drop in people getting in touch,” said Ms Stevens. “It could be that people are out of the house again and are feeling less anxious. I think a lot of people were just lonely and wanted a chat.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Germany accused of arming Russia ahead of chancellor\u0026#39s visit to UkraineRussia-Ukraine explained: How big is the risk of invasion and what could happen next?US carrying out most aggressive intelligence leaks on Russia \u0026#39since Cuban missile crisis\u0026#39If Russia is on the brink of invading Ukraine, you wouldn\u0026#39t know it in Moscow\u0026#39Who should replace Cressida Dick?’, is the wrong questionValentine\u0026#39s Day 2022: Ancient symbols, gory origins and the most unique gestures of loveMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"should replace cressida dick wrong question","story":"There will be few people shedding any tears at the resignation of Dame Cressida Dick as Commissioner of the politan Police. She has overseen a litany of failures broad enough to alienate the entire political spectrum, and her departure offers a long-overdue opportunity for an overhaul of this country’s largest police force.But the manner of her departure is not without its problems, and they can be summed up with this question: why does the Mayor of London have the power to sack the head of the UK’s counter-terrorism command?No wonder that the news has sparked a bitter row between Sadiq Khan and Priti Patel, with the Home Office claiming that the first they heard of Dick’s departure is when she called to tell them she was going.Not the level of strategic coordination we might hope for from the department in charge of law and order – especially because the Commissioner is actually appointed by the Home Secretary, not the Mayor.Yet it is now established that the Commissioner can’t continue to serve if they lose the confidence of City Hall. Boris Johnson will know this better than most as Mayor of London he engineered the resignation of Sir Ian Blair (the  described this as a “Tory coup”).At first glance, this might be easy to dismiss as merely a turf war between politicians. But the result is blurred lines of accountability. Formally, Londoners have no way of subjecting the leadership of their local police to democratic oversight. Practically, the Mayor can sack someone with UK-wide responsibilities, appointed by a government with a national mandate.What this means is that the question in all the newspapers this week, ‘Who should replace Cressida Dick?’, is the wrong question. We need to do better than just finding someone to do a better job in a fundamentally flawed position. Rather, the Government should seize this opportunity to undertake a root-and-branch reform of the politan Police, with a view to ending the current hybrid arrangements altogether.In its place we should have a normal constabulary for London, on the same basis as those elsewhere in England and Wales, with clear and formal accountability to the Mayor or the London Assembly, alongside one or more national organisations which answer to the Home Office.Obvious candidates for the latter include counter-terrorism, close protection, and aviation policing. But Patel should also look at whether or not the Territorial Support Group, this country’s primary public order unit, would work better as the nucleus of a new stand-alone operation.After all, one of the explanations often given for why the police are slow to get up to speed policing riots effectively is an alleged tension between community policing, which rests in large part on building positive relationships with the policed, and the more confrontational public order role. Formal ision of those responsibilities is the norm in many other countries, including our near-neighbours in Europe, and is worth exploring as part of a broader consultation on far-reaching reform.This brings us back to our question above. If the politan Police is reformed as a purely local police force, then the next commissioner can be selected from a pool of candidates geared towards those responsibilities.They will then be able to focus 100 per cent of their attention on delivering better policing for Londoners, and will have to answer to their elected representatives should they fail to do so. Meanwhile the Government can go about finding people best-suited to discharge the nationalfunctions separately.Given how very different the roles are, it would be no surprise if they ended up being filled by quite different candidates – indeed, it would be more surprising if they were not!But under our current system, the best-case scenario is that one of those people gets the job, and spends part of their time doing each bit as well as they can. Just as likely, someone who isn’t best-suited to either gets the job in an attempt to split the difference.Of course, the Met can’t simply go leaderless whilst this process is carried out. But Patel should make it clear that the upcoming appointment is a provisional one. If not, a vital shot at urgently needed reform will have been wasted.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Germany accused of arming Russia ahead of chancellor\u0026#39s visit to UkraineRussia-Ukraine explained: How big is the risk of invasion and what could happen next?US carrying out most aggressive intelligence leaks on Russia \u0026#39since Cuban missile crisis\u0026#39If Russia is on the brink of invading Ukraine, you wouldn\u0026#39t know it in MoscowValentine\u0026#39s Day 2022: Ancient symbols, gory origins and the most unique gestures of loveOur shouty modern age has no appetite for the complexity of great artMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin taking big gamble","story":"The arrival in Moscow of a team of top British defence envoys bearing an assortment of gifts for their Russian counterparts will not have gone unnoticed by Vladimir Putin, the country’s autocratic leader. Ever since Putin began stoking tensions over the fate of Ukraine last year, one of Mr Putin’s key objectives has been to make himself the centre of global attention.Irrespective of his ultimate designs towards Russia’s southern neighbour, one of the Russian leader’s less appealing characteristics is his deep-seated inferiority complex. With an excess of 130,000 battle ready Russian troops camped on the Ukrainian border, Mr Putin has certainly made himself a hard man to ignore.So the Russian despot will have been flattered to see both Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the newly-appointed Chief of the Defence Staff, arriving in Moscow laden with gifts that harked back to an altogether happier era in Anglo-Russian relations.Sir Tony presented General Valery Gerasimov, the man responsible for assembling Russia’s massive invasion force on the Ukrainian border, with a piece of iron from the mast of HMS Belfast, a veteran of the Artic convoys that helped to sustain the Russian people when London and Moscow were allies during the Second World War. For his part, Mr Wallace, a former officer in the Scots Guards, presented his opposite number, General Sergey Shoygu, with a regimental sword and a bottle of Scottish whisky. The gestures of friendship offered by Mr Wallace and Sir Tony arguably made far more of an impression on the Russians than Foreign Secretary Liz Truss’s fleeting appearance earlier in the week, when she seemed far more interested in performing a pale imitation of Margaret Thatcher visiting Moscow at the height of the Cold War than engaging in the serious business of crisis management.Even so, Britain’s efforts to cool tensions between Russia and the West will depend, as US President Joe Biden will have discovered during his telephone summit with Putin yesterday, to a large extent on just how serious the Russian leader is about provoking arguably the greatest global stand-off since the Cuban missile crisis by launching military action against Ukraine.The ambiguity surrounding Putin’s ultimate intentions concerning Ukraine certainly suits the Russian leader’s overall objectives which, so far as the West is concerned, is to generate an air of menacing uncertainty.As one veteran Foreign Office Putin-watcher explains, the Kremlin’s deft manipulation of the Ukraine crisis comes straight out of the Putin playbook, where the key objective is to keep his adversaries guessing about his goals.“The key to understanding how he conducts himself in a crisis is to remember his background as an intelligence officer,” says the diplomat. “His approach to any situation, whether it is threatening Ukraine or dealing with political opponents, is to keep his cards close to his chest so that it is difficult to anticipate his next move. This approach not only puts his opponents on the defensive, but it also raises the possibility that it will lead them to make mistakes that he can later exploit.”If Putin, then, is engaged in an elaborate game of chess with the West over the future of Ukraine, it is clearly one from which he is deriving enormous enjoyment, to judge by his dealings with numerous world leaders in recent days.Given the recent tensions between Moscow and London on issues such as the 2006 murder of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko and, more recently, the Salisbury poisonings in 2018, it was almost inevitable that Truss, making the first visit to Moscow by a British foreign secretary in four years, would receive a lukewarm reception.The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of Western attempts to call out the disruptive activities of Russia’s global spy network, and the mass expulsion of so-called Russian diplomats that was orchestrated by Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service in the wake of the Salisbury attacks inflicted a deep and abiding wound on the operational effectiveness of the Kremlin’s espionage activities.In addition, Britain has been at the forefront of calls to tighten up on the activities of Putin’s money men, the fabulously wealthy network of oligarchs who help to sustain the Russian regime – even if some of the measures proposed, such as tightening the oligarchs’ access to the City, admittedly lack rigour.Boris Johnson’s government has also adopted an uncompromising tone when it comes to upholding Ukraine’s territorial integrity – much to the surprise of the legions of critics who assumed Britain’s voice on the global stage would be much diminished post-Brexit.Against this backdrop, therefore, it was almost inevitable that Truss would encounter a hostile reception, with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, one of the Kremlin’s most accomplished bully boys, taking the lead in seeking to humiliate the British envoy.Lavrov has previous when it comes to insulting British foreign secretaries. In 2008, he famously subjected then-foreign secretary David Miliband to a foul-mouthed rant after the two men clashed over Moscow’s military intervention in Georgia, with Lavrov at one point barking: “Who the f--- are you to lecture me?”While Truss was treated with considerably more decorum, Lavrov, assisted by the Kremlin’s propaganda machine, nevertheless did his best to belittle her efforts. After dismissing the Foreign Secretary’s efforts to seek a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis as being like a conversation of “the mute with the deaf”, Russia’s flagship television news show, 60 Minutes, chided her for her attire, which channelled Margaret Thatcher’s fur-lined outfits during her 1987 Kremlin visit.If Truss was considered fair game by the Kremlin because of Britain’s robust attitude on the Ukraine crisis, the delight that Putin appears to be deriving from his constant embarrassment of Western dignitaries was equally reflected in his treatment earlier this week of French President Emmanuel Macron.Even though Macron had arrived in Moscow bearing peace proposals that were very much to Moscow’s advantage, he was still obliged to sit at the opposite end of a massive table, a move designed to highlight the French leader’s ambivalence about Russian Covid restrictions.On arrival in Moscow, Macron was asked to take a Covid test, but declined, over fears that this would enable the Russians to obtain his DNA – a not unreasonable concern, given the recent activities of Russia’s intelligence agencies.When Macron refused, Putin responded by arranging for their summit to take place with both men sitting at opposite ends of a 13ft table, to protect Mr Putin from potentially catching the virus.It is hard not to form the opinion that Putin is enjoying himself immensely as he subjects his Western adversaries to various forms of public humiliation.In what might be termed “Putin’s Revenge”, the Russian leader, who yearns to recreate the glory days of the Soviet Union when Moscow held the world in thrall, appears to be taking any and every opportunity to discomfort his Western rivals as they seek to defuse tensions over Ukraine. His insecurity is born, in part, from his experience as a young KGB officer in East Germany in the late Eighties witnessing the collapse of the Iron Curtain, and with it the destruction of Moscow’s status as a global player.Even though no one in the West has a proper understanding as to Putin’s true intentions with regard to Ukraine, the fact they feel obliged to use all the diplomatic tools at their disposal means that they have little alternative than to play along with Putin’s whims – whether that means sitting at a preposterously long conference table or being subjected to state-sanctioned rude remarks.Judging by the proposals made by Macron, there is every possibility that Putin will soon achieve his desired outcome in Ukraine without a single shot being fired in anger – despite increased tensions at the end of last week that culminated in “crunch calls” between Johnson, Joe Biden, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Macron and the Italian and Canadian prime ministers.Macron’s suggestion that Russia scale down its threatening military posture towards Ukraine in return for Kyiv implementing the Minsk agreements would go a long way to achieving the Kremlin’s ambition of exerting control over its troublesome southern neighbour.Under the terms of the agreements negotiated in 2014 and 2015, Moscow wants Kyiv to accept the principle that the Russian-backed territories of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east of the country be granted full recognition under the Ukrainian constitution. Such a move would, in effect, totally compromise Ukraine’s independence, as it would provide Moscow with a direct say in how it conducts its affairs – a proposal that, unsurprisingly, attracts little support among ordinary Ukrainians.But with Macron desperate to demonstrate his statesmanlike skills ahead of the forthcoming French presidential election, Germany increasingly dependent on Moscow to supply its energy needs, and an American president resolved to avoid conflict at all costs, the prospects of the West abandoning Ukraine in its hour of need are very real – a fact that Putin knows only too well.Nor should the crisis Putin has deliberately orchestrated over Ukraine be seen as a one-off in terms of the Russian leader’s bid to reassert Moscow’s presence at the heart of world affairs.One of the most frequently aired complaints of Russian policymakers is what they call the “unipolar” nature of world politics that has taken shape since the collapse of the Iron Curtain – one in which US hegemony dictates the shape and direction of global policy.To this end, Putin, the former KGB officer who is on record as describing the collapse of the Soviet Union as a “genuine tragedy”, has embarked on a sustained campaign to restore Russia’s status around the globe so that, like it or not, other world powers are obliged to take her concerns into account when considering key global issues.This motivation explains Moscow’s highly effective intervention in the Syrian conflict, where Moscow’s military role played a significant role in saving the Assad regime from defeat. Russia has also been active in Libya, where Moscow is keen to establish a controlling interest over the country’s oil wealth.Indeed, the Mediterranean as a whole is a major area of interest for the Kremlin. These days Russia is so well-established in Cyprus that the island has become known as “Moscow in the Med”, while, further to the west, Malta has become the latest target of Russian activity – to the consternation of both the US and the EU.Washington has expressed concern in recent months that the Kremlin is attempting to use Malta as a soft-entry point for access to the European Union and international financial markets. Recent figures show that a quarter of all applicants for Malta’s “golden passport” scheme, which allows high-income iniduals to acquire a Maltese passport within one to three years, are Russian citizens.The island is also a useful launch pad for Moscow’s activities in Libya, as well as other parts of North Africa, and the Pentagon is worried that Moscow might be trying to use Malta as a naval base for its malign activities in the Mediterranean region. As the statesmen finish their last-ditch phone conversation, the world awaits.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Germany accused of arming Russia ahead of chancellor\u0026#39s visit to UkraineRussia-Ukraine explained: How big is the risk of invasion and what could happen next?US carrying out most aggressive intelligence leaks on Russia \u0026#39since Cuban missile crisis\u0026#39If Russia is on the brink of invading Ukraine, you wouldn\u0026#39t know it in Moscow\u0026#39Who should replace Cressida Dick?’, is the wrong questionValentine\u0026#39s Day 2022: Ancient symbols, gory origins and the most unique gestures of loveMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"free covid testing could by","story":"Free testing for Covid could end next month despite concern of scientistsThe UK Government could reportedly soon end free Covid testing for the public, which is costing the Treasury billions of pounds, despite concern from scientists that the move could be too soonFree Covid testing could soon be ended Image: Daily Mirror Ian VoglerByTim HanlonNews Reporter:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsBrits could soon be forced to pay for their own Covid tests as the Treasury is pushing to save billions by ending the free service despite fears on the impact from scientists, it has been reported.Covid cases are dropping in the UK with only  areashaving seen numbers rise. With the rollout of vaccines and booster jabs the UK has seen the outlook brighten and overall cases,deaths and hospitalisations have been downcompared to last week. It comes withBoris Johnsonexpected to set out a new plan on Living with Covid when MPsfrom recess on February .This includes scrapping the legal requirement for people to self isolatethey test positive for the virus.And in Wales it has been announced it will easeCovid rules on masks and vaccine passportsbut self isolation will stay.Now thereports that the Treasury wants to end free PCR testing by the end of March for most people and exceptions would include those in hospital or the highly vulnerable.Lateral flow tests could be still given out free or limited to those over  and the vulnerable, it is reported.Ending the free PCR tests is clearly appealing to Rishi Sunak ’s department with billions having been spent to ensure that the public can find out for freethey have Covid and so slow the spread of the virus.There is concern though among scientists that it may be too soon to ask people to pay for their own PCR tests which can be expensive. The UK Health and Security Agencywants the Government to keep providing free tests until at least the start of April.  But anothersource also said that the Government was going ahead with plans to avoid free PCR tests and would close walk-in testing centres with only home delivery options available. Boris Johnson has revealed he plans to end self-isolation for people who test positive for Covid a full month earlier than planned, and will confirm the exact date in a statement to MPs on Monday  February.The prime minister said: “It is my intention toon the first day after the half term recess to present our strategy for living with Covid. “Provided the current encouraging trends in the data continue, it is my expectation that we’ll be able to end the last domestic restrictions, including the legal requirement to self-isolateyou test positive, a full month early.”  No  said it was a major step and faster than other European countries, but added: We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. The Government is expected to publish plans to live with Covid after recess ends in the final week of February. The Covid winter plan published last September said free lateral flow tests would eventually be scrapped but no date has been set for doing so. Prof Tim Spector, the epidemiologist running Kingaposs College London’s Zoe Covid study, said: “This is more a political type of statement rather than a scientic one. There is some rationale to this and other countries are doing things similar, but it’s clearly a race for the Government to say that Britain is first.” Dr Stephen Grfin of Leeds University said: “Literally blinding ourselves by removing testing and isolation robs us of the most fundamental means of controlling the spread.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The TreasuryBoris JohnsonHospitalsPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This proves, the new man said, “The Prime Minister is not a complete clown”. His job is to be positive about Johnson and the most positive he can be is he’s only part-clown. We’re in the final days of madness. No one would be surprisedBoris Johnson was found naked on the roof of  Downing Street with a jar of Heinz Thousand Island Dressing up his backside, blaming Joan of Arc for not prosecuting Jimmy Savile. Then Nadine Dorries will be asked: “Do you think this image will damage Mr Johnson”  And she’ll reply: “Shut your mouth! I bet Keir Starmer shoves posh French mustard up his backside ’cos he’s not a man of the people like our Boris.” Before being sick in a flowerpot. Next week, coverage of Prime Minister’s Questions will begin with Priti Patel sliding down a pole in a mist of dry ice lip-syncing to “I Want To Break Free” by Queen. Then we’ll see that Liz Truss has flooded the House of Commons and filled it with jellyfish, and Rishi Sunak is spearing them with a trident. The speaker will yell “Order, order, we can NOT use biblical weapons of death in the house” and it will barely be on the news. Now, to remind everyone of Brexit, Johnson has appointed Jacob Rees-Mogg as Minister of Brexit Opportunities, despite Mogg being unaware the th century has ended.  Mogg will announce: “Having parted from the European Union, we are finally at liberty to permit jousting in shopping centres. Furthermore, shorn of European red tape, we can reintroduce the rule whereby one is permitted to use a Frenchman as an ironing board.” After he replaced the staff who resigned, Boris Johnson said: “At last we have grown-ups running the office.” So who has he had in there before  How were they more childish than this lot  During the lockdown, they must have been telling Prof Chris Whitty: “I don’t WANT to say ‘Hands – face – space’ at today’s TV conference.

During a meeting on how to react to Vladimir Putin’s threats to Ukraine, Johnson’s communications chief would go red in the face and make a ‘hnnnnnnnn’ noise, and Michael Gove would say: “Oh dear – SOMEONE’S done a stink-a-poo”. In a meeting with the Bank of England about inflation, Johnson’s team would start banging a wooden spoon on the table and screaming, “ HATE the Balance of Trade I HATE it” until they had to be put down for a nap. And the only way Boris Johnson could calm them down was by wearing a red nose and silly big shoes and falling over to make them laugh, which luckily is the one thing he’s good at, .

Ministers are planning to update it later this year with rules for driverless cars.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wants Britain to be first off the grid to get autonomous vehicles on the roads.But politicians and motoring organisations say constantly messing about with the Code leaves drivers even more ­mystied – and could be dangerous. The AA’s Jack Cousens said: “It’s ­frustrating. As soon as they update it something  comes along.” Shadow roads minister Gill Furniss said: “This shambolic government are so mired in scandal they can’t even get the basics right. They haven’t even bothered to publicise the last set of major changes to rules on the road before they announce the next set.”  Tory peer Anne McIntosh added: “Would it not have been a good idea to present all the changes in one go ” And Simon Williams of the RAC said: “It’s vital the changes are crystal clear, otherwise there’s a very real risk drivers will be confused. This could lead to avoidable road traffic collisions.” The new rules will tell drivers when they can take their hands off the wheel in traffic jams so their cars can nudge ­forward automatically.It will be the firstdriverless cars will be allowed to perform when so-called ALKS – Automated Lane Keeping Systems – are introduced later this year. Mr Cousens added: “You won’t be able to have a nap or pick up a newspaper because you must always be ready to take charge of the vehicle again.” Ministers say driverless vehicles could be worth £billion to the British economy by  and create , new jobs. There was widespread confusion over last month’s Code changes giving new rights of way for cyclists and pedestrians. And a section on banning hand-held mobile phones even while stationary was forgotten and only added on Thursday. Roads minister Baroness Vere said: “Further changes covering the use of self-driving vehicles are planned and will be laid before Parliament later this year.” Ministers say driverless vehicles could be worth £billion to the British economy by  creating , new jobs by cornering six per cent of the world market. A DfT spokesperson said: “The development of self-driving vehicles has the potential to revolutionise travel, making every day journeys easier and greener – and crucially, safer. “These changes will set clear expectations for road users and drivers.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The AAVehiclesPoliticsDriverless carsMotoring mishapsSunday PeopleCar crashes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The ex-welfare chief accepted a cash donation in November from Cyprus Premier Holidays, which specialises in travel to North Cyprus. But Parliament’s latest financial disclosures reveal he refunded the payment on January . Sir Iain has long campaigned for a ban on flights to Turkish occupied North Cyprus to be overturned. Asked why he ed the payment, Sir Iain told the Sunday Mirror: “Simple, didn’t need it.” He said the donation had been “unsolicited”, and added that when he saw he had received the money, he said “I don’t need this, I don’t want this.” He voluntarily refunded the cash to the firm to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest.  Currently, only Turkey flies direct flights into Northern Cyprus - with all flights from where needing to touch down in Turkey first. And since , more restrictions have been placed on passengers from the UK entering the region through Turkey - forcing them to disembark, undergo security screening and fly into Cyprus on a separate aircraft. There’s no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of either Sir Iain or Cyprus Premier Holidays. There are an estimated , Turkish Cypriot people living in the UK - with around , of them living in Sir Iain’s constituency of Chingford and Woodford Green. Sir Iain has been vocal in his support for overturning the ban, and met with Ersin Tatar, the Prime Minister of the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus in January . In , Sir Iain arranged a Commons petition calling on the government to overturn the flight ban.And the same year, he told a Turkish Cypriot cultural festival in London: I am doing my level best to urge the government, the Foreign Office and the international community to recognise the problem facing families in my constituency and their ability to fly directly to North Cyprus.” Sir Iain has not raised the issue in Parliament since the donation was accepted. Last year , in response to a separate petition to overturn the ban, which attracted more than , signatures, the Government said it had “no plans to authorise direct flights between the UK and the north of Cyprus.

It’s sort of got a Game of Thrones feel to it, a veiled kind of threat. But we’ve been repeatedly ­assured – and the feeling round here is that it’s accurate – that the police are doing a thorough and accurate job on their party investigations. It’s dficult to be convinced. The Met is not looking great. Cressida Dick’s time in charge is over. Pretty much a catalogue of disaster, save a new world U-turn record on Thursday when I didn’t even have time to finish Wordle in the gap between, “I’m not going to quit” and, “I quit”. Ms Dick leaves with a terrible record. If you can ignore – and who can ignore  – some of the disgraces she has presided over, the most damaging is the failure to change decades of rotten culture.  It was  when the Macpherson Report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence found the Met to be “institutionally racist”. It was just last year that the Home Affairs Committee said there was still work to be done. Met Commissioners come and go yet the problems remain. Is the next boss going to sort things out  Probably not. It’s clear the Met needs a change of culture urgently. Maybe it’s impossible. That it is too deeply ingrained. For example, I received a copy of a report from Teesside University about the experiences of  women officers in England. It took first-hand accounts from the s onward.  The s, as you would expectyou’ve watched The Sweeney, were chilling. Just a catalogue of low-grade horror. In , one woman said: “It was the norm for policewomen to ­undergo initiation ceremonies which were normally of a sexual nature. “I don’t mean full sex but it was not unusual for police officers to grope policewomen up, make lewd remarks and jokes.”  That kind of treatment carries on through the decades, all there in black and white. Same old same old. Fty years later, messages from Charing Cross Police Station show more sexist chat from officers, branching out into rape, beating their wives and killing black children. Clearly the “just a couple of rotten apples” defence has failed. At least a fair bit of the ­barrel is on the turn. I’m not sure the calls for disbanding the force or splitting it up will work. It is a root and branch job that will be slow and painful. It’s taken decades for what little progress there has been, so what’s a few decades more  Meantime, the question of would you want the Met deciding who the Prime Minister is remains out there. No, is the straight answer. At the moment I don’t even trust the Met to decide who the criminals are.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Scotland Yardpolitan PoliceCressida DickStephen LawrenceSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The meeting came just months after the Prime Minister promised to look into the project - in the same text message as he begged for more cash to revamp his Downing Street apartment. Police are now considering whether Mr Johnson had broken anti-bribery laws with the text messages. Now it’s been revealed Mr Dowden accepted free tickets to the Royal Albert Hall a few months after the meeting. The then-Culture Secretary accepted two tickets to a th Birthday Concert featuring new music by Bond composer David Arnold at the London concert venue, last July. Lord Brownlow is a trustee of the Royal Albert Hall Trust and an ambassador of the hallaposs th anniversary.  Lib Dem Chief Whip Wendy Chamberlain has written to Mr Dowden to demand the government reveal what was discussed in the January meeting. She said: “Not only did Lord Brownlow help the Prime Minister magic up the cash to redo his flat, he also seemingly bought himself a key meeting with a cabinet minister to discuss his own pet project.” She added: “We deserve the truth and need to know exactly what was discussed in these meetings. Oliver Dowden must come clean and release the full details of this meeting. If he refuses then it begs the question, what does he not want us to know about the nature of his relationship with Lord Brownlow  The Sunday Mirror has been seeking the release of documents relating to the ‘Great Exhibition’ meeting under the Freedom of Information Act. But the Government has failed to acknowledge the request - and it is now more than a week over the legal deadline for disclosure.Solicitors for the Labour Party wrote to Scotland Yard last week, suggesting the force was “duty-bound” to begin a formal investigation, because there was a “reasonable suspicion” that the law had been broken.The Met confirmed they had received the letter which was being considered by officers from its Central Specialist Crime Command. There’s no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Lord Brownlow.Labouraposs lawyers said the PM may have acted improperly by having “linked” the request for funds to cover the refurb with a promise to “promote a project” backed by the benefactor. In response to the solicitors’ letter, a Met spokesman said: A letter was received and acknowledged on Friday February . It is being considered by officers from the Metaposs Central Specialist Crime Command. No investigation has been opened. But Number  dismissed the accusations as “categorically untrue and a clear misrepresentation of the facts.” They added: “Lord Brownlow, separate to his work for the emerging Downing Street Trust, put proposalsfrom the Royal Albert Hall, the national institution and charity, to the Prime Minister. This was passed to the lead department, DCMS . It is a matter of public record that no project was taken forward by the Government. A government spokesperson said last night: “Former Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden met with Lord Brownlow and the Royal Albert Hall on the joint proposal for a Great Exhibition, which was declared in DCMS’ regular transparency s. “It is usual practice for all Prime Ministers and Ministers to have proposals put to them at ious points and Ministers also meet stakeholders regularly as part of their engagement on an array of issues. “In line with normal practice this idea was referred to the relevant department, considered and ultimately not taken forward by the Government.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cressida DickBoris JohnsonConservative PartyLiberal Democratspolitan PoliceScotland YardText messagesCrimePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Writing in the Sunday , Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay said both financially and in taking a step back from people’s lives ministers would be taking a new approach to government.It comes just days after Communities Secretary Michael Gove gave a speech in Liverpool vowing to hand more power to northern leaders and making levelling up the central mission of our times.“Now, it is a priority to restore a smaller state – both financially and in taking a step back from people’s lives. It’s time toto a more enabling approach. To trust the people,power to communities, and free up business to deliver, Mr Barclay wrote.Concern is growing that the Prime Ministeraposs flagship levelling up agenda will now take a back seat and several reports have also suggested Chancellor Rishi Sunak is blocking cash for projects in the North and Midlands as he tightens the purse-strings post-Covid.Alex Norris MP, Labouraposs Shadow Levelling Up Minster, said: Our communities are clear they want more ambition and a long term plan for their areas, but the Tories canapost even agree the basics.  At the start of the week Michael Gove told northern leaders state intervention will be needed to level up the country. At the end of the week the Prime Ministeraposs new Chief of Staff is telling Tory backbenchers the priority is less from the state. This government are incapable of agreeing on anything and people are paying the price.” Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is under sustained pressure over the Partygate scandal, with Downing Street confirming he has been sent a legal questionnaire by Met Police cop investigating rule-busting gatherings at No. He will leave Westminster this week insisting he is “getting on with the job” while touting his staffing changes in No as helping to focus on his “levelling up” policy as he fights to stay in office.Downing Street said he is to start the week with a visit to a manufacturing site in Scotland before heading to an oncology centre tackling coronavirus backlogs in the north west of England.In a statement, Mr Johnson said: “I’m getting out of London this week and taking a simple message with me – this Government is getting on with the job of uniting and levelling up the country.”Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis was also bullish during the Sunday morning broadcast round, saying the Prime Minister will “fight” and win the next election despite the parties scandal. He told Sky’s Trevor Phillips On Sunday: “He has my absolute %-plus loyalty. I think this a Prime Minister is doing things for our country, he’s got the big decisions right. I think he will fight and he will win as a result of the next general election.” But travelling north of the border will present its own challenges for the PM, with his ally Jacob Rees-Mogg having accused Douglas Ross of being “lightweight” after the Scottish Tory leader called for Mr Johnson’s resignation.Mr Johnson has called in a lawyer to help, as he calls from Tory backbenchers for him to go will only grow louder and more widespreadhe cannot convince police he was not in breach of regulations at up to six events. It has been reported that evenhe is fined he will not resign - something that would be likely to trigger Tory MPs to force a vote of confidence in his leadership. Scotland Yard says the questionnaires, which have legal force, ask for an “account and explanation of the recipient’s participation in an event” and have “formal legal status and must be answered truthfully”. Fteen Tory MPs have publicly called for Mr Johnson to quit, while more are thought to have privately written to the  Committee of backbench Tories calling for a no-confidence vote. More are poised to do sothe Prime Minister is found to have broken his own coronavirus laws, or further damaging details emerge from the Sue Gray inquiry.

The barrister said staff on the plane were aposrudeapos to him when he askedthe family nanny could move into business class as he and his we wanted to work on the flight to Turin, Italy. He said one of the cabin crew even told him aposyou wishapos. The plane was grounded as the debate continued on and the pilot finally insisted the family be removed from the flight, which was delayed. Mr Banner told Mail Online : If BA had told me that the nanny could not sit with us in business then we would not have travelled and could have got a later flight. But they only told us that when we got to the boarding gate.I behaved perfectly but I was challenging the cabin crew because it was the right thing to do. It was a very upsetting event for all of the family and the way we were treated was appalling and in contrast to over  years of pleasant experiences on BA flights as a regular customer. Mr Banner said there was a spare seat near him in business class, however, BA staff told him the nanny could not sit in it, he claims.

The lawyer, who vowed to never fly with BA again, has already received two verbal apologies.

An environmental health officer visited the Aberfan Chinese, in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales last August and swtly issued a zero hygiene rating due to the unacceptable conditions. The owners were also taken to court for the breaches and ordered to pay £,, Wales Online reports.Merthyr Tydfil Council, who oversaw the inspection, were alerted after a member of the public spotted rats scurrying around inside. The council has now shared the shocking images from their visit, showing evidence of a rodent infestation and a bag-full of poison dashed on the floor of the storeroom. An unannounced inspection on August ,  identied immediate hygiene concerns within the business and found that food had been exposed to contamination, as well as evidence of a rodent nest.  The statement explains: The Aberfan Chinese takeaway in Merthyr Tydfil was found to be operating in poor hygiene conditions and ordered to close due to a rodent infestation. The council’s environmental health department received a complaint from a concerned member of the public who had spotted rats in the rear yard of the food business. An unannounced inspection carried out by an environmental health officer on August,   identied immediate hygiene concerns within the business. The statement added: The kitchen was dirty, food was being exposed to contamination and there was clear evidence of a rodent nest within the storeroom where food ingredients were being stored. The inspector found serious defects within the structure of the premises which allowed rodents to enter with ease and a bag of poison had been thrown on the floor hoping that this would deal with the problem. It was clear that this issue had been ongoing for a long period of time and the business owner failed to deal with the issue properly.Given the unacceptable conditions, the inspector served a legal notice to formally close the business until improvements were made and the business was issued a food hygiene rating of zero, which is the lowest score that can be given. Merthyr Tydfil council member Geraint Thomas added: This case demonstrates that our Environmental Health Officers will take swt and necessary action to protect public health when there are clear failures within a food business that put customers at risk. It is essential that proprietors of food businesses comply with food hygiene regulations. The Covid pandemic should not be used as an excuse by food business operators to allow their hygiene standards to slip. I would urge all consumers to check the food hygiene rating of a food establishment before they consider eating from there. It is a legal requirement for ratings to be displayed in Wales to help consumers make informed choices.” Owner of The Aberfan Chinese, Mrs Xiu Hui Xiao attended Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates Court on January , , and pleaded guilty to nine charges of breaching food hygiene regulations, the court confirmed on Friday. The council said that Mrs Xiao was fined a total of £, and ordered to pay costs of £. and a victim surcharge of £. It is not known whether environmental health has visited the establishment since its visit last August. As of February,  , Aberfan Chinese has a zero food hygiene rating on the official food hygiene standards website. For the three areas listed on the website, hygienic food handling, cleanliness and condition of facilities and building, and management of food safety, the inspector has remarked major improvement necessary.

Alex Pereira said the politan Police Commissioner’s resignation is “a little justice”  years after the killing of his cousin, Jean Charles de Menezes, . Two cops shot him seven times in the head at Stockwell Tube station, south London, in July . It happened just two weeks after the   bombings and one day after a separate foiled bomb plot when cops mistook the Brazilian electrician for fugitive terrorist Hussain Osman. Ms Dick, then a commander, was cleared of blame in Jean’s death but his family have aways been angered by her rise to the Met’s top job. Alex said Jean’s mum Maria really hated her. He went on: “I think Maria is very happy now. I think Jean’s father feels the same way – maybe even more than his mother.  “It’s a little justice, but it is a justice. They should have sacked her  years ago, shortly after Jean’s death. She went very, very bad in that job but they promoted her.” Alex, , who lived with Jean in London for six months in , remembers a happy childhood growing up near his cousin in the little rural town of Gonzaga in south-eastern Brazil. Sharing a picture of them together as children along with Alex’s sister, he said: “At that time, no one had shoes – we used to go out barefoot. We made all our own toys – we dreamed of owning bikes.  “But it was a good le because it was very peaceful with zero violence.” In the aftermath of Jean’s killing, Alex knew his cousin had been totally innocent. But he says he and his family weren’t believed. He added: “That made me so angry. You don’t think something like this is going to happen to you. It’s likeyou were sent to the moon oryou moved to another planet. It was very, very crazy.” No officers were prosecuted for the killing but the Met was fined for breaking health and safety laws. In  Jean’s family took a case to the European Court of Human Rights as part of a final attempt to see someone prosecuted, but judges ruled against them. Dame Cressida quit on Thursday after a series of scandals.They include a report detailing evidence of misogyny, racism, and homophobia at Charing Cross police station. The Met has also been criticised for its probe into Downing Street parties held during lockdown. Last year the public was outraged by the abduction and murder of Sarah Everard by cop Wayne Couzens – as well as the heavy-handed arrest of women at a vigil. There is no suggestion Jean’s death was a factor in Dame Cressida’s resignation – which came hours after she told radio listeners she had no intention of quitting.She said it had become clear she no longer had the support of the London Mayor Sadiq Khan.Alex said: “I believe thatyou do something, you will pay for it. Doesn’t matter how much money you have or how much power you have – you’re going to pay.”Murder victim’s brother: New boss must do better The brother of a murdered private detective has called for the new Met Commissioner to prosecute or expel “bent, lying cops”. Alastair Morgan, , says chiefs have been keener on saving reputations than tackling corruption. In , Alastair’s brother Daniel, , was found in a pub car park in Sydenham, south London, with an axe in his head. After five police inquiries, the case remains Britain’s most investigated unsolved murder.  Daniel’s family have long blamed police corruption. And last summer, an independent report into the case described the Met as “institutionally corrupt” – and blasted Cressida Dick for obstructing the inquiry. Alastair says he was furious she was allowed to continue in her job after that and now hopes her successor will do more to rid the force of corruption. “Prosecute bent, lying cops – it’s as simple as that,” he says. “Andyou can’t prosecute them, kick them out. “There has to be consequences. I’m sick to death of non-accountability in the police. I’m sick to death of non-accountability in Britain as a whole.” Alastair and his family are now suing the Met for damages, alleging an ongoing cover-up.

The future King is expected to make sure his coronation is more representative of dferent community groups and faiths.  This is part of his vision of a modern aposslimmed-downapos monarchy, a royal source told the Mail on Sunday. The Queenaposs ceremony on June   was influenced by Britainaposs global empire at the time. Although the empire was in decline, the UK still had more than  overseas territories when the Queen was crowned. It was only in  that Prince Charles himself declared the aposend of the Empireapos when Hong Kong was transferred to China.  Many of Britainaposs former territories are now part of the Commonwealth, which the future King will lead when he ascends the throne. Some , troops from the Commonwealth and  from the aposcoloniesapos took part in the Queenaposs coronation parade, which involved a total of more than , armed forces personnel. More than , dignitaries, including representatives from British protectorates overseas, were taken to Westminster Abbey in the procession. The Queen had to change her outfit several times during the ceremony, which was viewed by an estimated  million people across the world and lasted more than three hours.  Charlesapos service will be a more scaled back affair, with a maximum of , guests, the Mail on Sunday reports. A source told the newspaper: It will be a slimmed-down Monarchy on display throughout. I wouldnapost be surprised to see just Charles and Camilla, Kate and William and their children on the Buckingham Palace balcony afterwards. An insider said there are aposbinders and bindersapos of paperwork on the accession and coronation, although Clarence House denied any detailed plans had been drawn up.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The Coronation service was rewritten in recent years to modernise the language and shorten the event. Although it will be an Anglican service, there will be a place for other religions and Christian denominations. Charles previously showed his embrace of other religions in Britain by saying he would like to be known as aposDefender of Faithapos - instead of aposDefender of the Faithapos. He also plans to switch the official insignia that appears on postboxes and police officersapos unorms from St Edwardaposs crown to the Tudor Crown.The costs of the ceremony will be met by the taxpayer and Charles is said to be keen that it should be aposgood valueapos.

He gave a statement admitting killing Lin and Megan Russell but now allegedly denies it.The source said the serial killer’s wind-up has caused “heartbreak and anguish”. Bellfield – whose murder victims include teenager Milly Dowler – had given a statement in which he admitted killing Lin, , daughter Megan, six, and attempting to kill her sister Josie, nine. But he has allegedly retracted it and now denies the  murders in Chillenden, Kent, sources say. He has reportedly bragged his four-page confession was a ploy to “mess” with Michael Stone, who is serving le for the murders but has always denied guilt. The source said: “Bellfield is a narcissist who loves the limelight – he’s now saying he just wanted to mess with Stone’s legal team. “He doesn’t appreciate the absolute heartbreak and anguish he heaps on the Russell family every time he publicly speaks about the crime.” Insiders say Bellfield is even claiming to have written a formal letter to Kent Police to distance himself from the crime.Bellfield, , gave a detailed admission to Stone’s solicitor Paul Bacon last month saying that he was behind the countryside killings. Stone, , hoped the unsigned document would prove he had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice. The Criminal Case Review Commission has been looking at the convictions – at Stone’s request. But the supposed U-turn by Bellfield – already serving le for the deaths of Milly, , Amelie Delagrange, , and -year-old Marsha McDonnell – means he may now refuse to help the CCRC.  Ex-Chief Supt Kevin Moore led a review into the hunt for Bellfield after he murdered Milly and fears he may now be hogging the limelight. Mr Moore, , said: “People like him aren’t normal. They love the limelight, the bravado. You have to askthis is an opportunity to be in the headlines. “Yes it’s right and proper that it’s looked into, but I would very much doubt the validity of his admission.”The former Sussex police chief was immediately sceptical about Bellfield’s claim to be the killer.He explained: “You have to look at the circumstances. Bellfield’s other murders featured a sole female victim. The modus operandi for the murders of Lin Russell and her daughter is a whole dferent ball game. The others involved the abduction of young women from the streets in busy areas, in cities, towns. “Chillenden was out in the country. Stone had knowledge of that area, I can’t see how Bellfield had knowledge of that area. I don’t know why Bellfield would confess now – he’s serving a whole le sentence so he’s not going to get a reduction in his sentence.” Bellfield’s supposed confession came in a four-page statement. He said he wore yellow marigold washing up gloves, had taken a hair scrunchie as a souvenir, killed the family dog after it bit him and had to call in Clacket Lane services on the M to wash off blood. The statement said: “My first intention was to just attack Lin... the situation just got out of control.” It went on to detail how he said he killed Lin and Megan and left Josie for dead with appalling injuries.  He said he ed home to Twickenham, South West London – the patch where he would carry out a triple murder spree – went to work as a bouncer and, next day, threw the murder weapon into the Thames. Bellfield, now known as Yusuf Rahim after converting to Islam, wrote: “Something like this has never happened, in the sense I’ve committed a crime and another person has been arrested. “I apologise to Stone and the Russell family for my heinous acts.” The document was sent to the CCRC, which has the power to order retrials.

Brittany Haughton is demanding that the  are removed and she has already turned them off, reports Stoke Live. The -year-old, who has autism, moved into the -bedroomed council house in December  after being on the waiting list for over two years.And now she is locked into a -year long contract with the Community Energy Schemewhich she wants to end. But Brittany either has to accept the solar  or go back onto the waiting list for a house without the modern roof.  The house in Blurton is a Stoke-on-Trent City Council property but the fuel bill issues have caused Brittany extreme anxiety.The mum-of-two told Stoke-on-Trent Live : “The  were not saving me any money. I was still paying through the roof for electricity. I don’t see the point of them being on.“It has been stressing me out. I’m a single mum - it’s just shocking. I am worried in case debt collectors come knocking on my door. “I’ve got autism so I have problems in social situations. I struggle to read body language as well. I don’t like going out at all and I don’t like strangers in my home. I don’t need this. My anxiety is through the roof.” Brittany added: “If I hadn’t accepted this house I would have gone back on the waiting list. I first went on the list in  so I had already been waiting for two years.  “This was my ideal house and I needed it because one of my girls has special needs so she requires her own space so I had to accept the house, I couldn’t afford to wait any longer. “I want the solar  down - I’ve always wanted that. I’m very disappointed.” CES says any tenants who turn off the solar  are in breach of its contract.A CES spokesman said: “Throughout the coronavirus pandemic we were extremely conscious that many people were impacted financially.We were therefore very flexible in our approach to customer payments, and set up a bespoke Stoke-based team who recently started conversations with those customers who were not paying their bills to see how we could support them in doing so. “Options available to customers who engage with our team and provide an accurate meter reading could, for example, include -month payment plans or an export to the traditional energy grid for new energy use.  “Given our supply and charges are not impacted by wholesale supply or costs, we reduced our base price for solar usage by five per cent from October . “In practical terms that’s an average saving of  per cent against Ofgem’s current price cap. “Ofgem has now indicated that it will increase the price cap by over  per cent in April. Taking anticipated inflation into account, we expect that in April our prices will be in the region of  per cent cheaper than the price cap. “We’ve worked hard to find a way to get sustainable and affordable energy to those who would otherwise completely miss out. “We know ours is currently the only way to achieve this – there is no alternative scheme with the same offering – and we are determined to make it as easy and beneficial as possible to our customers. “We continue to welcome all tenants to get in touchthey have any questions or concerns so that we can take appropriate action to support them.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Solar powerproperty newsHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It is understood he personally called the Duke of Sussex to tell him the news, something which may have surprised his second son, writes Mr Kay.Mr Kay wrote: It is entirely possible that Harry was taken aback by his grandmotheraposs announcement.  What do you make of what Richard Kay wrote  Respond in the comment sectionSources close to William indicated that he was not part of the decision-making process, so it is, therefore, extremely unlikely Harry was. The story of the relationship between the brothers and the woman who never wanted to be their stepmother was always awkward and frequently tense. Neither of the princes shared public statements immediately after the Queenaposs announcement, although William was reportedly apossupportiveapos of the decision.Meanwhile, Harry paid tribute to his mum Diana when he broke his silence four days after the announcement.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Taking the statement as a pointed reference to Camilla, Mr Kay added: He might just as well have added aposand nor could anyone apos. The royal expert warned that a lack of warmth on the part of Harry towards his step-mother could be interpreted as a snub. Back in , Harry called Camilla a aposwonderful womanapos who made his father aposvery, very happyapos.  Mr Kay said it is now hard to relate Harryaposs praise for Camilla with his failure to acknowledge Camillaaposs new future title.In her announcement, the Queen said: “When, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his we Camilla the same support that you have given me. “And it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.” A spokesman for Charles said: “The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said of the Queen’s announcement: “This is the most extraordinary message.”And recalling Diana’s Panorama interview in , Mr Hunt added: “For Camilla, the journey from being the third person in a marriage to queen-in-waiting, is complete.” Dickie Arbiter, a former press secretary to the Queen, said hostility towards Camilla after the  death of Diana “has evaporated completely”. He added: “The Duchess has shown that she is a great support to Charles, the Queen and the institution.” Royal author Dr Andrew Lownie said: “Camilla has earned her spurs.

The Queen was surrounded by her family and maids of honour when she waved to huge crowds below the palace after her coronation in . A source told the Mail On Sunday that Charles wants his coronation to be aposfar cheaperapos than Her Majestyaposs ceremony, which cost £.million - the equivalent of £million today. What do you think of Charlesapos slimmed-down monarchy plans  Have your say in the comment section  It was suggested that the list of guests will be as few as a quarter of the number invited in  - and there will be far fewer members of the Royal Family itself. A source said: aposIt will be a slimmed-down Monarchy on display throughout.I wouldnapost be surprised to see just Charles and Camilla, Kate and William and their children on the Buckingham Palace balcony afterwardsapos.  Prince Charles and Camilla will be crowned side by side in the scaled-back coronation ceremony, it is claimed. It comes after the Queen revealed it is her “sincere wish” that Camilla will be known as the Queen Consort when he son takes to the throne. The last time a Queen Consort was crowned was in  when the Queenaposs mother, Elizabeth, sat alongside King George VI.  A source told the Mail on Sunday that plans for Charles and Camilla’s coronation, which is due to happen within a year of his accession, are being discussed as part of Operation Golden Orb. The ceremony will be “shorter, sooner, smaller, less expensive and more representative of dferent community groups and faiths. The source also said some aspects of the coronation will be altered to “reflect modern day Britain”, but it will remain an Anglican service with the vows not expected to change. The number of guests will be limited to , and fewer members of the Royal family will be in attendance. Far fewer protectorates are also expected to be invited.

The Duke of Sussex’s friends ­predict that the Duchess of Cornwall – unveiled by Her Majesty last week as the future Queen Consort – will come in for particular criticism in the no-holds barred memoir. Harry used his latest public appearance, a video call this week with former Wales rugby captain Gareth Thomas, to pay tribute to his late mother, Diana. But tellingly, he did not say a word about the dramatic news that Camilla, , will in effect become the next Queen when his father Prince Charles, , ascends the throne. His silence “speaks volumes” says one pal, who alleges Harry, , is still not close to Camilla.The friend said: “Although tensions have eased between the two of them over the years, it was more for a show of unity than a close relationship. “There were big problems at the start but as Harry and his brother William aged and matured, things got better and they can now co-exist as adults. “They were never close with her and they still aren’t.”Diana famously referred to Camilla in her  interview for the BBC ’s Panorama when she said there were “three people” in her marriage to Charles.Harry’s potentially explosive book will be published in the run-up to Christmas. His friend added: “He has got lots to say about it. People think he’s keeping a low profile to respect the family but it’s not that.  “He’s writing a book. He’s got a multi-million-pound book deal and he’s keeping a lot of his opinions for that. The memoir deal states that it should include personal details of personal and family arrangements. And it will be a really intimate take on his feelings about his family and what has gone in the breakdown of the relationship. “If they think that he’s gone soft, then they are mistaken.  “Just wait for the book to come out because that will shake the monarchy to the core.” While the future of Camilla has been settled and Prince William, , is said to be supportive and respectful of the proposed change to her status, Harry is said to have snubbed the woman his mother ­allegedly called The Rottweiler.  When teenager Harry was initially introduced to Camilla shortly before the first anniversary of Diana’s  death in a Paris car crash, aged , their encounter was said to be ­awkward and tense. Harry was only , missing his mum terribly and was not in a position to defend her memory. But as time went by, he and William did develop a warmer relationship with Camilla. Harry said in , during an interview to mark his st birthday, that he and William “loved her to bits”. And he also publicly thanked her for making their father “very, very happy”.  But since Harry’s move to America with we Meghan, , he has been keen to ensure that his tragic mother’s memory and legacy are not airbrushed from history. During his heartfelt tribute to his mum this week he said “I could never fill her shoes” – which royal commentators point to as meaning no one  can either. The book is ­expected to be ­published late this year by Random House. Harry, who is now living in Calornia with Meghan and their children Archie, two, and Lilibet, eight months, is working with ghostwriter J. R. Moehringer. The American Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist has penned books with former tennis champion Andre Agassi and Phil Knight, the co-­founder of footwear giant Nike. The memoir is expected to ­explore Harry’s childhood, his time in the military – including in the Afghanistan war – and his marriage to American-born former actress Meghan. In a statement, the prince explained his motivations for putting his story on paper. He said: “I’m writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become. “I’ve worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story – the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned – I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think. “I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I’ve learned so far and ­excited for people to read a first-hand account of my le that’s accurate and ­wholly truthful.” Our source said that the publishers are keen to grab the Christmas rush and also ensure that the content is timely. They added: “They want to release everything in ­tandem – book, documentary, etc, like a Big Bang all in one go. It might be quiet now but just wait.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Camilla, Duchess of CornwallPrince HarryPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal FamilySunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mites, weighing just  grams, or .lbs, arrived when mum Jade was  weeks and five days pregnant. Barely cmlong – theof a king-size Mars Bar – doctors gave them zero chance of survival as Jade went into premature labour. They told the desperate mum-to-be she was having a miscarriage. Then came that wail – “like a tiny kitten”, says Jade. In a flash, medics burst into action to save what are believed to be the most premature twins to be born and survive in Britain.  They were delivered more than week before a foetus is deemed medically viable. And their gentle sobs were music to the ears of Jade and husband Steve, who had spent  years and £, trying to become parents. Speaking exclusively to the Sunday Mirror, Jade, , says: “When Harley let out the smallest of cries the room went mad and they suddenly offered le-saving treatment. “It was the same with Harry, who was inside me still for a full hour unmonitored. The babies had been given a zero percent chance of survival. “It felt amazing to hear them cry, though I was still scared.” But the tough siblings weren’t going anywhere and have gone from strength to strength – amazing doctors at the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham.  Early pictures show just how tiny the babies were – their arms barely the size of their dad’s finger. “At birth they were smaller than an elf on the shelf,” Jade explains. “There wasn’t a nappy small enough. The smallest clothes are for babies up to .kg – well mine were g.” At birth their handspan was cm. It is now cm and they have doubled into cm. NHS worker Jade beams: “I’m so proud of my babies – they’re little fighters. For them to get through everything and still be there just smiling away is incredible. If they can do that, they can do anything.”Now  weeks, Harry and sister Harley could be discharged by their due date on February . In their quest to be parents, Jade and Steve, , endured  years of treatments – including eight cycles of IVF and several implantations of frozen embryos.They tried to conceive naturally for three years and Jade suffered an ectopic pregnancy before they began IVF in . The couple took out loans and worked hard to pay for £,-worth of treatment – which “nearly bankrupted us”.By late , Jade had another three miscarriages after IVF and was told she had an overactive immune system causing her body to reject pregnancy. But Jade and Steve, who works in sales, refused to give up hope. “We just wanted a family so bad and I’d had embryos frozen so we had a need to use them,” Jade says. The couple, who live in Derbyshire, made contact with another fertility clinic – in London’s Harley Street and reputededly one of the best in the world. Jade was prescribed medication to combat immune system problems.  Then, last May – IVF cycle number eight – the couple had two embryos transferred. Both worked and they were told they were expecting boy and girl twins. “I couldn’t let myself believe it,” Jade recalls. “I was so fearful of a miscarriage or something going wrong. I literally didn’t do anything during the pregnancy as a result. “The few bits of clothes that I did buy made me think that I better keep the tags on just in case – you just don’t want to let yourself believe.” On October  Jade went to get checked out after leaking fluid. An examination revealed she was experiencing membrane ruptures that happen before the onset of labour. Doctors are not required to medically intervene with babies born prior to  weeks as they are not considered to be viable. But Jade had chosen Queen’s as it has a more extensive neonatal intensive care unit than her local centre.  And, as a teaching hospital, staff intervene with babies born from  weeks to learn about premature births. At the time of going into labour, Jade was  hours away from the -week mark and was told she was likely to lose her precious twins. “It was so scary,” she shudders. “The doctor kept saying it was a miscarriage but I said it couldn’t be because I could feel the babies moving. I knew they were OK but was being told they wouldn’t survive at this stage of gestation. Labour happened really quickly. I was denied pain medication and monitoring during labour as I wasn’t viable, which was awful.” Doctors chose to intervene after her babies showed signs of le when born. Jade adds: “I remember saying that I couldn’t hear Harley cry and one of the nurses said I wouldn’t because she was far too early. “But then I heard this cry, like a tiny kitten. Harry did the same when he was born an hour later, still in his sac. In Japan, it is seen as being luckyyou have a baby born in their sac, so I held on to that luck!” Harley and Harry were incubated and whisked to the NICU – Neonatal Intensive Care Unit– where they remained on ventilators as doctors worked hard to save them. Two hours later, Jade was wheeled to the unit to meet her miracle twins. “I was in disbelief,” she says. “It was amazing. But seeing them so tiny and fragile in the NICU was scary with the doctor’s predictions in my head.” Desperate for hope, Jade and Steve searched out a mother of American twins born at  weeks, who are now four. They spoke via Instagram and Jade says: “She guided me through the first few days of being in the unit and what to ask for.”But things took a bleak turn at a week old when the twins were diagnosed with gastrointestinal illness necrotising enterocolitis. It can be fatal and the parents were told to prepare to say goodbye. It was a hellish time. Jade says: “We were told to get the family in and have a christening. “I kept referring to the christening as ‘the funeral’. It was just awful.” But the little fighters pulled through. Previously, the UK’s most premature twins to survive were Brighton tots Jenson and Reuben Powell, born at  weeks and six days, in . Jade got to hold her twins for the first time when they were four weeks.“It felt amazing to finally feel them moving again,” she smiles. The twins have had more health problems as a result of their premature birth, including chronic lung disease and sepsis, and have undergone six surgeries between them. But the siblings – who now weigh .kg, or .lbs – have defied the odds and are thriving in the NICU, where they have now spent  days. Jade goes on: “We are working towards the twins coming home on my due date. Usually doctors would tell us what they did with other babies at the same age, but they don’t have any  weekers to base it on because it just doesn’t happen. I’m really lucky that I went to Queen’s instead of my local hospital. If I’d gone there, I wouldn’t have come home with any babies, and it’s where the ambulance would have taken me because of the catchment – it’s a postcode lottery.” Matron Cheryl Grfiths and consultant Chantelle Tomlinson told the Mirror: “We are delighted to have been able to provide neonatal intensive care for Harley and Harry and to support them and their parents, Jade and Steve, in their journey.” Once discharged, the twins are likely to require oxygen at home and may suffer long-term issues. But Jade adds: “They’ll go down in medical history. I’m sure they’ll have a ward named after them because everyone is just amazed by them!” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSHarry CraneBabiesHospitalsPregnancyGiving birthImmune systemMiscarriageTwinsIVFFertility\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She has a rare type of cancer called Neuroendocrine which started in her pancreas and has spread during the years she was misdiagnosed. For nearly three years, Laura was repeatedly turned away from doctors when she complained about pain in her stomach and back. To make matters worse, at the time, Laura and her husband, Paul Anderson, were trying for a child. Laura said: “I was in and out of the GP with lots of lower abdominal pain and lower back pain. “When I had blood taken they would just say it was a viral infection, continuously, just say viral infection until I persisted and pushed. Have you got a similar story to tell  Email webnews@mirror  “I was always missing work and we were trying to conceive after we got married in . “You’re explaining that to the GP and I just thought there was something wrong with me, something related to oies or something like that. But they never investigated more early on.” Laura was repeatedly dismissed by her GP and told she just had an infection and she woud be fine. On one occasion when her pain was investigated, they found a swollen spleen but she was dismissed and told it would go down with time. Then, to make matters worse, the pandemic hit, and Laura’s le, like that of so many others, was thrown into turmoil. As GP surgeries shted to virtual or phone call triages and appointments, Laura often found herself in agony without medical support.  She said: “I was in and out of AE during Covid, getting ultrasounds and loads of other scans. “In January  when I was at my worst healthwise, the pain was so severe, I got a scan, and on it, it showed I had a swollen spleen. “They said to me there and then, you’re young, you’re fit, you’re healthy and it’ll go down in time. “I went back in April, the easiest thing was to go back to AE otherwise I was not being seen.” Laura constantly battled back and forth to be seen and taken seriously. In May she had three separate scans to try and figure out why she was in pain. Doctors eventually thought she had endometriosis after looking into her oies and referred her to a fertility clinic. Laura said: “I didn’t give up, I had to go back into AE for a third time [in June] and had an ultrasound and met a radiologist and they saw a shadow on the scan and put me in for an MRI. “That’s when then they called me into the GP and told me ‘you have a tumour in your pancreas, it looks like pancreatic cancer, you have three months to live’ and at this time I hadn’t seen any of my family in a while, and they were like ‘You need to go home to your family’.” After her diagnosis, Laura was put on chemotherapy but said that it didn’t work for her and instead of bringing the tumour down, her cancer spread to her lymph nodes. With the help of her husband, they began looking for other treatments for her ‘incurable’ cancer. After speaking to a neuroendocrine specialist from Manchester, she came across a clinic in Mexico that offered alternative treatments. Laura chose to pursue the treatments not offered on the NHS, including “non-toxic” medicine and focusing on the “mental and emotional roots” of the cancer.However, the clinic costs in excess of £, for an approximately three-week course, so Laura was forced to turn to fundraising to get there. Family, friends and loved ones from Ireland rallied round and in only a few days she raised the money she initially needed. However, when she was out there she was told by the clinic she’d need more treatment which would cost even more, forcing her to turn to fundraising once more.

After she ed, she combined the treatments and approach from the clinic, with radiation therapy in Glasgow to try and treat her cancer.She is nowfundraisingagain to try and raise £, so she can afford a six month course with the clinic once again.She said: “Somethingaposs working, I’m still alive. The specialist in Glasgow said something’s working but we don’t know what, they’re sceptical about the help the clinic offers. “Every penny means so much for us, and it’s hope for the future.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBack painTherapyCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Some people praised the unnamed mum for taking the time to make such a lovely, artistic lunch, with one saying: aposI would seriously wet my pantsI got a butterfly sandwich for school! I love the effort you put into everything.aposapos A second posted: Youaposre a fantastic mamma. A butterfly sandwich. Wow. But despite how impressive the lunch looked, a few still managed to find something to criticise the mum for. Others couldnapost help but point out that it might have been a aposwaste of timeapos making the food look so nice as it would get tossed about in a school bag, while a few thought the mum had made a mistake by packing it in the wrong kind of tub. One person said: Thataposs so gorgeous! Itaposs a shame it wonapost look the same when they open it....it all gets messed up once in the bag. Another wrote: Wonapost the sandwich go very dry by tomorrow  aposapos A third replied: Shouldnapost it be in an airtight container.aposapos This comes after a snap of a dferent lunchbox went viral, as people tried to work out what was wrong with it. The seemingly innocent-looking lunchbox should apparently be ringing alarm bells for parents. The tin contained ham white bread sandwiches, crackers, a fruit roll-up and a chocolate yoghurt and looks pretty similar to what many of us tucked into at break time when we were kids.But according to Australian nutrition experts at the Cancer Council NSW, this meal could actually be doing more harm than good saying it hides an uncomfortable truth parents might not want to face. To highlight their concerns, they also shared a photo of a second lunchbox to seepeople can notice the dference.The second lunch box contains a cheese and tomato sandwich, fruit, vegetable sticks and yoghurt. The images were intended to show parents how much sugar is hidden in their childaposs lunches, as the first box contains twice the sugar and half the second packed lunch.You canabout it here.What do you think of the lunch  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ParentingViralFood\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Raju became a global symbol of hope among animal welfare campaigners and his rescue has led to  other elephants being saved from similar horric abuse. Shackled  hours a day in spiked chains, he had been ­routinely beaten and starved. But he was saved in a daring midnight rescue by a team from British and Indian ­charity Wildle SOS, who were “stunned” when Raju wept as he realised his ordeal was ending.Photos of him crying as his chains were cut away were revealed in the Sunday People before making ­headlines around the globe.Wildle SOS co-founder Kartick Satyanarayan said much has changed in the years since. He said: “He’s ­finally learned to trust humans again – that really is a miracle. He’d gone through so much suffering we’d wonderedthat could ever be possible.  “Once he realised he was in safe hands, Raju gradually began to show us his personality and has become extremely gentle. His rehabilitation has been astonishing to witness.” Today, Raju has a field to walk freely around, takes relaxing dust baths and even has a personal pool to splash about in, playing with his favourite toy – a huge rubber tyre. But, says Kartick, the story does not end there. He stressed: “If anything, it begins from it. Our team now works with unparalleled dedication in ­tracking ailing, abused elephants from all across the country.”  Support from around the globe after Raju’s rescue has enabled the charity to save  more elephants – with the most recent rescue on New Year’s Eve. Kartick said: “Our latest three, all saved in December, sum up the suffering.Pari, who arrived at our elephant hospital on December , has been left crippled where she’d been tethered in an abnormal position for decades.  “Ginger was covered in chemical paint and charcoal decorations – used for wedding processions, but also to distract from her terrible abscesses and bull hook wounds.” On top of that, Ginger is blind, probably done to her deliberately to make money out of people’s sympathy.Kartick added: “It’s heartbreaking. She’s suffered  years of horror. She must be so exhausted.” The third and most recent rescued animal is Lakshmi, between  and  years old and thought to be the thinnest elephant ever seen in India.  Kartick said: “It’s shocking to see a severely crippled and emaciated elephant like Lakshmi – she’s one of the worst cases we’ve ever witnessed.” The extensive work is made possible by donations since Raju’s plight touched the world.Kartick said: “His legacy is leading to the rescue of many more in desperate need, who will live out their days in peace and freedom at our sanctuaries.” When Raju – thought to be  – was rescued in July , he had been “owned” by  dferent people across five decades. Kartick said: “It had left him gaunt and miserable. He was restrained with spiked chains and his withering body bore multiple scars and chronic ­abscesses – it was pitul.”  The charity boss, who founded Wildle SOS in  with Geeta Seshamani, says he will never forget the moment his team cut Raju free. He said: “Re­moving those chains was symbolic. As well as freeing Raju, for us it meant this great responsibility to give him a second chance at le. “And as for the tears  It was so incredibly emotional for all of us. We don’t know how scientic this is, but it seemed like he understood that we were there to help him.”  ­Kar­tick says there are “many, many more” elephants still needing rescue, used for circuses, street begging, weddings and tourist rides.He fears many people still do not realise the brutality used to make them compliant.  They are deprived of sleep, food and water for months, tightly restrained, and beaten into submission with electric prods and bullhooks. Kartick said: “The process is brutal. It is known as ‘phajaan’, or the breaking of the spirit. The objective is to drive fear into it to the extent that it’s too terried to ever retaliate.”  While many UK tour operators now promote cruelty-free travel, he says everyone can help by signing the petition at refusetoride.org. Kartick added: “For every elephant ride that makes one feel like royalty, we must remember that the elephant suffers a letime of abuse and torture.  “With the help of the Refuse to Ride campaign, we encourage tourists to opt for ethical practices by refusing to ride them for entertainment. “Our message is simple –you love elephants, please do not ride them.” To support the charity or donate, visit wildlesos.orgMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CharitiesElephantsSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

New symptoms of the iant are often tricky to spot and donapost emerge immediately.Most people affected by the milder strain will suffer a cold-like symptoms such as runny nose and sore throat.But experts have highlighted a strange symptom all mums should be aware of.Nikki Jurcutz, a mum and CEO of the Australian parenting organisation Tiny Hearts Education, posted on Instagram that one motheraposs breast milk had turned green after she and and her baby contacted Covid.It may look a bit gross, but this incredible colour change is the antibodies in this mamaaposs milk doing their thing! And doing it right! she posted on the . When weaposre lactating, our bodies are consistently doing whataposs like a full-body scan of both our own and our bubaposs body to perfectly create breastmilk for our little loveaposs optimum health, as well as recovery from illness.  Itaposs pretty mind-blowing when you think about it! Motheraposs milk is often described as “liquid gold” as it can adjust nutrients to suit a baby’s needs. Ashmiry, a mum-of-two, posted two images of her breast milk in pouches before and after she caught the virus.One of the pouches was white as it is expected to be but, when she and her her daughter tested positive for Covid-, the second picture showed green-tinged milk after they became ill with the virus.She was astonished to see the colour of her milk change.But she was also excited because it showed her body was creating extra nutrients to keep her daughter nourished. She wrote: “I really wanted to share this photo of my breast milk. “It actually let me know something was going on in my body and my babies. “How amazing is breast milk, it’s magical and I’m so thankful to be able to produce it especially now!  “The colour change indicates that my body is making exactly what Rubi needs! Antibodies, extra fatty and just pure goodness.” She admitted that she drank the breast milk when ill with Covid-. She explained: “I was so grateful at that time, that I was still nursing. “Otherwisenot I would have not experienced that or seen what my body was able to do for Rubi. “We all had some of that breast milk. I had my own breast milk. “But hey I got better, I was tired of being sick, so I was thinking aposI’m going to drink some of that breast milkapos, and I did. I don’t knowit helped, who knows.While the green milk was a result of coronavirus - this isnapost always the case andyouaposre concerned, you should check with your midwe.Green milk can also be caused by the food and drink you consume. One breastfeeding support coach explained that you shouldnapost panicyour breast milk is green. Juobie said: Donapost panic, itaposs organic.Typically breast milk will turn greenish in colour when you have consumed green foods including vegetables, food that contains green dyes and certain vitamins or herbs. It is safe to give to baby, so donapost be too quick to pour down the drain. Golidilacts, a lactation consultant, also shared the image calling the milk, liquid green gold alongside the message, “our breasts are super responders”. “When lactating, our bodies are always doing full body scans of mama and baby and figuring out exactly what to put in breast milk for babies wellness,” he said. Experts reckone the change in breast milk colour is because of the presence of more immunoglobulins, white blood cells, and leukocytes, which combat illness.The Australian Breastfeeding Association also said green breastmilk can occur after eating large amounts of green coloured foods including green vegetables, kelp and other types of seaweed in tablet form.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesBreastfeedingCoronavirusParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Russia could withdraw its , troops massing on three sides of Ukraine’s border as the West demands. And bingo! Crisis solved. Or NATO could agree that Ukraine should not join it, withdraw combat forces from Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and take its missiles out of Romania, as Vladamir Putin says it should. Sorted! Peace in our time. The squaring-up over Ukraine could all be part of a massive international gamble by Russia and the West to see who blinks first. After all, Mr Putin assures us he has no intention of invading his neighbour.  Joe Biden and Boris Johnson tell us that no matter what happens, we will not fight the Russians. Yet the US President ordered another , American troops to Poland on Friday. And Mr Putin is galvanising his soldiers for action. Britain, Germany, Denmark, Japan and the Netherlands have ordered their citizens to leave Ukraine immediately. For leaders who say they are seeking a peaceful solution, these are remarkably warlike preparations. History tells us how quickly these things can get out of hand. Within  days of a relatively minor terrorist incident in Sarajevo in , the world was at war and  million people perished. But it is not too late to pull back. It will require delicate diplomacy, but more importantly, understanding on both sides. Mr Putin will need to accept that NATO is not going to retreat to pre- borders. And we, in turn, must tone down the aggressive rhetoric to convince him NATO really is only a defensive alliance. The alternative is too horrible to contemplate. We urge all leaders to redouble their efforts to find a compromise. Honour Sir Sean Sir Sean Connery was the first and, many say, the greatest . His descent into dementia was heartbreaking. But it shows that even James Bond can succumb to this most awful of illnesses. The m his widow Lady Micheline has donated to dementia research is hugely welcome. But more needs to be done. Degenerative neurological conditions are already Britain’s biggest killer, and with a growing ageing population that will only get worse. We can expect the , sufferers today to treble over the next  years. The Tories pledged an extra £million of dementia funding in their  election manesto, but we are yet to see any of that money. Finding it must now become a priority. We know Boris Johnson struggles to tell the truth or keep his promises. But this time, his word must be his Bond.

Every pound raised will add up to help keep children safe.It is free for any school to sign up and once a school has registered, the NSPCC will send it everything it needs to make its Number Day a success.Schools will be sent tips and ideas on how to fundraise, including games and activities resources to help promote Number Day information on keeping children safe from harm and online safety quizzes that can be used with pupils of all ages. After the challenges of the past  months and the disruption that children have faced, we hope it will be a day of fun to look forward to.To sign up to take part in Number Day, all you need to do is visit the NSPCC’s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school’s details using the registration form.Head of Fundraising for NSPCC Scotland Paul CockramSirThere is a real emergency for colleges coming after years of underinvestment. Regarding the sector, the debate on funding should focus on the perilous choices some colleges will now have to make, and on the signicant challenge this Draft Budget poses for the next academic year.The total funding loss of £. million means, for example, freezing recruitment, outsourcing support activities, possible changes to temporary contracts, increasing class sizes and consolidating classes.All of these would be a last resort, however, after years of under investment this Budget leaves no more space to manoeuvre in. Unless there are improvements to the Budget, noticeable changes to colleges are inevitable.We believe this risks Scotland sliding into a skills emergency. Even in the midst of a pandemic colleges have provided world class education and training to hundreds of thousands of students.But in order to continue there has to be investment based in reality. Scotland’s recovery depends on creating year after year a workforce that is qualied and able – but with the proposed Budget settlement, colleges will be challenged in ways not seen for many years.Chair of Colleges Scotland Ken Milroy MBEThe Poverty and Inequality Commissionhas published advice to the Scottish Government on its Child Poverty Delivery Plan -SirOur advice shows that, quite simply, too many children are still experiencing poverty in Scotland. As a society we believe it’s wrong for children’s lives to be restricted by poverty. That’s why the child poverty targets were set.While we know work is ongoing, progress is not enough to meet the targets, and for some measures the position is worsening. Despite a clear commitment, the action taken by the Scottish Government so far is inadequate We need to see Holyrood using all the levers available to end the scourge of child poverty.We need to see action across all areas of Government in order to release families from the constraints of poverty. Providing parents with support to apply for a job, for example, won’t have the impact we wantthe parent can’t get suitable childcare or doesn’t have a reliable bus service to get them to work.Targets to reduce child poverty can be met, however the Scottish Government will have to utilise every opportunity and deliver action faster, coupled with a signicant increase in fundingWe are committed to working with the Scottish Government to eradicate child poverty and ensure it remains one of its top priorities. It will take a concerted joint effort from PIC, the Scottish Government and its partners to resolve these issues and ensure our children have the very best start in le.Chair of the Poverty and Inequality Commission Bill Scott "},{"url":null,"title":"help elaine conquer the world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll#s very own racing star Elaine MacEachern is aiming for the top # but she needs help.Just four months after breaking her leg at the Women#s Motocross World Championships in Madrid, talented Elaine is hungry to test herself once more against the very best.After a three-year break from the sport, Ormsary girl Elaine stormed to the  British Women#s Motocross title.Moving on to the world championship Spanish round, there was disappointment as the rigours of practise left her with a broken tibia and fibula.Now fit again and excited for , Elaine is looking for new sponsors.She explained: #The support I receive is incredibly kind and a huge factor in me being able to achieve the British championship in .#This year my plans are to defend the women#s British title, to race as many women#s world championship rounds as possible and also in the MX class in the ScotMX championship alongside the men.#For the women#s British they have moved from three rounds to six.

Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum.

It would goodit was cut back and trimmed or a fence erected to help deter people. It is not aesthetically pleasing with graffiti along the route. The lighting looked to be sufficient but there was one broken lamp post which will be fixed by SBC. It is also a very lonely path to walk. Therefore, I would also say that some areas would require CCTV as a deterrent and to know that there are eyes watching.”The path is a busy and popular walkway which starts opposite Asda and continues to Tweedbank and beyond. Most of the path is not overlooked by houses which makes it potentially vulnerable and there have been a number of incidents over the years.Community Councillor Bill White said: “The walk we did was well worthwhile. It pointed out a few points and identied a few areas of concern to look at and hopefully we can take this forward.“I’ve already said that I think we should change the name of it from the Black Path. There needs to be some landscaping done and there are some areas where a little more lighting could help. CCTV would certainly put people off and maybe make people feel a bit safer. But there is certainly a lot of work to be done I think more down toward the Gasworks but it’s a nice walk.Sergeant Granger offered advice to people using the path. He said: : “Fortunately such incidents fairly rare in the Borders, but we can’t become complacent. My advice would be to be aware of your own surroundings, keep your phone about you and let your family knowyou’re walking along here late at night. If you are walking on the path and you are concerned about anyone you see, oryou think you’re being followed, then just contact the police straight away on .\".removeCommunity council chairperson Judith Cleghorn said: “It could be such a beautul walk. We could make it into quite an attraction, but it needs a lot of work on it.”Community Councillor John Birnie added: “I believe that street lighting is not the problem.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match. Tomorrowthey face the same opponents, Finnart, at Kintyre Park, after their postponed fixture in early December.

In doing so, we are offering no mere conventional respect to a great public figure who has passed from us.#We did not think of George VI as a monarch living in high places, remote from the lives of the ordinary men and women of this realm.#Such was his le and character that his passing came as personal grief to everyone of his loyal subjects. We think today of a man who served us all with the highest and most self-sacricing sense of duty and probably beyond the limits of his strength – a man of complete integrity and of great personal courage and endurance.#His le exemplied the virtues on which, as we all know, the welfare of our nation depends. What his example has meant for all of us we can only dimly comprehend.#Our respectful and affectionate sympathy in these days is constantly with our Royal Family.#To a new queen, so young, and yet so well equipped for the high duty to which she has been called, we pledge our loyal service in all the days to come.#My most memorable experience in a public le, extending to more than  years, was when I had the honour and privilege of a private conversation with his late Majesty King George VI.The occasion was when the Conveners of Counties and the Provosts of Burghs in the West of Scotland were presented to their Majesties in the Town Hall, Greenock, on July  .Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, Princess Margaret and the Duke of Edinburgh accompanied the King and Queen.After being presented to His Grace, the Duke of Montrose, I, in turn, introduced the Provosts and their wives of the six burghs in the County of Argyll.Shortly afterwards, I was summoned to His Majesty#s presence.The King immediately put me at ease by asking me to sit down and join him in a cup of tea. He then spoke to me of affairs of the county.To my delight, he displayed a wide and intimate knowledge of Argyll, a county for which he said he had a deep affection.He was keenly interested in all I told him.After about  minutes# conversation, I asked permission to withdraw but His Majesty said, #Do wait a little longer, please.#I came away with the feeling that I had left a gracious King, a great gentleman and, above all, a good and sincere man.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Musselburgh and District Angling Clubabout the issue of mine water discharge, fearing it was having “a negative effect on the fish and invertebrate communities in the South Esk”.These concerns predate the recent pollution incident in the River Esk last month.Residents who attended the Coal Authority sessions heard more details about the plans for the treatment scheme at Dalkeith, which will remove iron and manganese from water flowing from a historical drainage tunnel adjacent to Newmills Road, known locally as Junkies Adit.The tunnel is linked tothe extensive underground coal mine workings in the Midlothian area.In recent years, the amount of mine water discharging from Junkies Adit has been increasing and the water quality has been deteriorating, the Coal Authority said.The organisation explained that the water affected was visibly orange, which was a result of naturally occurring iron dissolving in the mine water underground, which then became solid as it mixed with air and settled out of the water.In recent years, the discolouration has become more visible further downstream and could affect the river’s ecologyleft untreated, the Coal Authority added.The Coal Authority has been working with the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand other partners to monitor the problem and develop a solution.Details for planning approval will be submitted shortly, with a view to starting the main construction later this year.More detailed design work will be done in the coming months to develop the scheme, and residents and stakeholders will have the chance to provide feedback as the designs progress.John Batty, Coal Authority project manager, said: “I think a lot of residents are keen to see this project progress as the river is so visibly orange as a result of the mine water, and the negative impact on the wildle and ecology is widely known.“The mine workings are complex so it has taken many years to get to this point.“We have been working to carry out studies and investigations, evaluate potential solutions and establish water quality by taking water samples on a regular basis through the challenges of the pandemic.“We have undertaken research using a test treatment scheme on site last spring that provided a large amount of information to feed into the designs.”Paul Butler, SEPA mining sector lead, said: “We are pleased that the progress we have made together has enabled the Coal Authority to provide information on the proposals for a new mine water treatment scheme at the site of Junkies Adit.”Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, said: “I think it is important that the public are involved with the process and it is vital public engagement continues as the scheme progresses.“I look forward to seeing the next stages of the treatment scheme and working with the Coal Authority, SEPA and the local community on this project.”Steven Dalgleish, of MDAA, said: “No faulting the Coal Authority’s commitment to the cause but the association remains gravely concerned that funding may not appear for this project.“From some of our own research, it seems that this may remain an issue for over  years, leaving the South Esk between Dalkeith and its junction with the North Esk effectively dead and useless as the main salmon and sea trout spawning bed area it once was.”"},{"url":null,"title":"day-today-prestonpans-shut-due-covid-energy-price-rises","story":"Thanks from the East Lothian community have been shared across social media following the news that Day-Today – also know locally as Ashiq’s – is to close.A number of factors have contributed to owner Ferhan Ashiq’s decision to close his Redburn Road shop for good on February .Ferhan told the Courier that “the writing on the wall” came when Covid struck the county two years ago.This coincided with a serious burn injury to Ferhan and we Hira’s youngest son which put “stress on the business, with hours reduced to take care of him”.Additionally, Ferhan confirmed that the Day-Today store was also facing a huge surge in electric costs – a rise from £, per year to £, – which he said was an “insurmountable” price, putting the business in an “untenable situation”.He added: “With the costs of goods rising as it was, in good conscience could I really be asking the people of Prestonpans to be paying more for their products “I saw the writing on the wall – their own energy pricing will be going up and,anything, they will be needing to make their money go as far as possible, so we as a family decided we will leave before we are pushed.”Energy price rises for homes and businesses will continue after Ofgem announced that average energy bills will increase by £ from April – a rise of  per cent.Pandemic isolation rules put further pressure on staff and the Ashiq family.Ferhan added: “Running a store of that size is quite an undertaking: you end up working -hour days, seven days a week for three years, no holidays, no breaks.“Isolation measures put pressure on staff members covering other shts and working much harder.”Thanking the Prestonpans community, the shop owner said: “Our family is so thankful to everyone who helped us achieve what we have in Prestonpans for the last  years.“This business put myself and my sister through education and we both went to university off the back of it, and that could never have happenedthe community hadn’t shopped in our store.“I went to school with a lot of customers and I’m watching their kids grow up and become friends with my kids.”It has been confirmed that Day-Today has been sold and will “never be a convenience store again” – the new owner and business will not be revealed until March .The Ashiq family plans to stay in Prestonpans for the foreseeable future, while the family’s Levenhall Village Store in Musselburgh will remain open.Ferhan said: “I am looking to devote more time to my lovely we Hira, who has stood by me all these years throughout all the hardships, and my young children Harris, Niall and Daniel.”The alleged theft from the premises was reported to police, who are understood to be investigating the matter."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-leader-norman-hampshire-standing-re-election","story":"Norman Hampshire is Labour’s candidate for the Dunbar and East Linton ward in May’s East

Council to refuse planning permission for the flats, describing the new build as “over-dominant”.The proposal by Edinburgh-based BY Developments Ltd would see the bungalow on Gullane Main Street demolished and replaced by a passivhaus building containing four three-bedroom flats.In a letter to the local authority, the community council said that while it did not object to the idea of flats on the site, the current proposals were too big and it added that the design appeared to include windows which were just one metre from neighbouring houses, adding: “It is hard to imagine this providing adequate lighting.”The proposals to replace the house, known as Glen Maree, with the flats aims to make it as sustainable as possible, with its design statement describing the residential development as “net zero”.It will include electric car charging points at a private parking area to the rear of the property, solar  and non-fossil fuel heating systems.The roof design has been created to ensure maximum solar exposure to support the flats and the design statement points out that easy access to public transport is also available to new residents of the flats.It adds: “This development makes efficient use of land, buildings and infrastructure by altering a previously developed plot of land in a town centre rather than a greenfield site on the town periphery, for example.“Industry-leading Scottish cross laminated timber is to form the superstructure, whilst Passivhaus principals of airtightness, heat recovery and solar gain are to be employed to create very efficient, low-energy dwellings.“We believe this strategy will result in a very energy-efficient use of the plot, with the four new apartments using less energy than the existing building.“We intend to create an exemplar development that demonstrates sustainability without compromising design quality.”The design statement adds that the site itself is not in the Gullane Conservation Area but “on the periphery” of it.Despite plans to position the new building eight metres back from the Main Street pavement with a large front garden area, the community council said that the design did not fit the site.It said: “We have no issue with the general principle of creating flatted accommodation on the site.“The particular choice of design, creating four substantial flats across three floors rather than the two of the neighbouring houses, does appear to be over-dominant in scale.“Eventhe building were able to be set slightly further back this effect could be diminished, but the site appears not to lend itself to this.”The application is available to view on the council planning portal."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-gift-card-scheme-saw-sales-rocket-first-pandemic-christmas","story":"The East Lothian

Lothian Investments on behalf of the local authority as a year-round offer following the success of the council’s Christmas shop local campaign, which had run for a decade.Hundreds of cards were sold

their stores, with no business charges applied to them.Pet shop owner Fiona Veerman said that the card had been a boost for local traders who were battling against online retailers.Fiona, who runs Veerman’s Pets  Co in Tranent, said: “We have always welcomed all customers into the shop with a smile, and we feel that this is especially important today as high streets up and down the country struggle to compete with online giants and out-of-town shopping centres.“We have been involved with the East Lothian Gt Card scheme from the outset, as it was created specically to encourage customers to think locally.“This is very important to us, as we also live in Tranent and know that money spent locally stays in the community.”No figures are available for the current financial year yet

One evening in  I was sitting in a student flat in Stirling listening to Janice Long on Radio . During her handover to John Peel, she dedicated the last record she played to the veteran DJ. The track in question was Speed Your Love to Me by Simple Minds, I think. Or maybe it was Up on the Catwalk.What I do remember more clearly, though, is John Peel’s response at the start of his ownprogramme. “Thanks, Janice, for that piece of pomp rock,” he saidbefore pressing play on something that was more to his liking .In my head it was a marker of how things were on the turn. Two years previously the reputation of Simple Minds couldn’t have been greater. The release of the New Gold Dream album both propelled them into the charts and into the album of the year lists in the music press. It felt like the culmination of the band’s steady progress from punky wannabes to art rock giants, “a gradual, heady ascent up a huge mountain,” the music critic Dave Simpson once suggested.New Gold Dream was the mountain top. A hypnotic, pulsing, thrilling thing. One of the great Scottish albums.But with its anthemic feel and thunderous percussion, the release of Waterfront in October , the first single off the Sparkle in the Rain album, flagged up the fact that the band were beginning to drop the art and concentrate on the rock. As a result, they began to lose the critical acclaim and cult status and became a global success. Swings and roundabouts.In the years that followed the Minds would rack up hit after hit and bad review after bad review. When it comes down to it, most bands would. quite understandably, prefer the former over the latter.However, success fixed the image of the band in the public consciousness. As the years – decades now – have passed, they are usually remembered as the band who gave us Alive and Kicking and Belfast Child and recorded Keith Forsey and Steve Schf’s Don’t Youfor the film The Breakfast Club . The shimmering electro of early singles such as I Travel or The American, the songs I danced to in a Stirling student disco, are often overlooked.So, one of thepleasures of Graeme Thomson’s new book on the band, Themes for Great Cities, is its desire to be an act of reclamation.Thomson wants to challenge the lazy cliches that have attached to the band’s reputation, to complicate the story, to, as he says in his introduction, “remysty” his subject. To that end he revisits the early years of the band and suggests why they matter.He follows the bands from Toryglen to the charts, concentrating on their earliest records, from ’s Le in a Day to ’s brace, Sons and Fascination and Sister Feelings Call. Records touched by the influence of both krautrock and Giorgio Moroder, post-punk and prog. This was music, Manic Street Preacher James Dean Bradfield once suggested, made by “crystalline gods.”And music made not just by singer Jim Kerr and guitarist Charlie Burchill, the faces of Simple Minds now for over four decades, but by all of the band’s original line-up. The democratic first incarnation of the band was fuelled as much by Derek Forbes’s bass, Mick MacNeill’s keyboards and Brian McGee’s drumming as by Burchill and Kerr. All five members contributed to the sound of Simple Minds.“It was very much a collective,” Thomson tells me when we speak in January. “I like that autodidactic thing of young working-class people stretching themselves, pushing themselves and absorbing all these influences and just how abstract a lot of that music is. It’s very challenging, I think it’s still very fresh. I think it warrants a listen. I like the fact that it’s not canonised.”Thomson, who has written acclaimed books on Kate Bush and John Martyn, is a long-time Simple Minds admirer. Now , he was  or  when he first discovered them around the release of Sparkle in the Rain, when the band were nearing their commercial peak. Like a true fan he then went back to explore their earlier records.One of the reasons for writing the book, he says, was simply to celebrate their nascent achievements. “You want to write about the music you love, and these albums are among the earliest and first records I ever loved,” he points out.“You also look for fresh ground. I don’t think those records have been written about, compared to a lot of the records in the canon. Even post-punk records that at the time were quite marginal, like Unknown Pleasures, are now part of the musical establishment.”The story Thomson tells is of a young band moving fast, constantly changing, looking outwards to the continent In central Europe men are marching …”, growing up, finding their feet.And that explains how they became more and more central to the story of pop by the mid-eighties. They’d found a map to take them from the outskirts to the centre of the city. Next stop, stadium tours.“They get this accusation of selling out,” Thomson suggests, “and I suppose I wanted people to see how they started making that bigger music in the mid-eighties and how it was organic in a way. It kind of makes sense when you see how their story evolved.“I think when a band’s made six or seven records before they have a hit it’s hard to accuse them of being cynical.”Simple Minds at their mid-s peak The story of Simple Minds is the story of the s, a story of experimentalism followed by ato classicism. They were not the only ones who followed a similar trajectory.The Waterboys, led by Mike Scott, sang of their quest to capture “the big music” on their  album A Pagan Place and they weren’t alone in that desire. Big Country, U and even Echo and the Bunnymen were all chasing the same goal at the same time.It was a moment when horizons broadened and, Thomson suggests, old worlds were rediscovered. In the book he paints a picture of a group of young men from Glasgow, perhaps disillusioned with their surroundings, who go and experience Paris and Berlin and thenhome and begin to see that Glasgow is also European.“And you start to reflect more of your own culture,” Thomson suggests. “And I think you can hear that in Simple Minds when it starts to become a bit more Celtic, a bit more elemental.”More than that, though, the band was changing too. Drummer Brian McGee left in  and bassist Derek Forbes left in . Line-ups change and the music being made is transformed as a consequence.“You can argue that Simple Minds have been many dferent bands really,” Thomson suggests. “There are two central figures, but when you lose a drummer and you lose the bass player, then it becomes a dferent band, and you work in a dferent way. The music inevitably is going to change.“Brian McGee the drummer was replaced by Mel Gaynor, who is this huge propulsive rocket launcher of a drummer and I think that changed the sound.”The thunderous drive of Waterfront was the first evidence of that.Simple Minds the band have continued to evolve over the years, have been, as Thomson says, many bands. And yet their image is frozen at the point of maximum visibility, in their mullety, sing-along-chorused commercial peak.“It’s a picture in reverse,” Thomson says. “Simple Minds started complicated and got more accessible. U did the opposite. They wanted to become more experimental, and I think when you start from a point where you are painting pretty crude pictures, as U were, it’s easier to mess with that.“U borrowed a lot from Simple Minds. Simple Minds were ahead chronologically, and I think artistically, for a long time. New Gold Dream certainly had a huge impact on U. You can hear it on The Unforgettable Fire.“And also, like the Tory party, U stuck together. They managed not to lose any members. Keeping the same personnel in place during your whole career is going to enable you to do that.“By the early s Simple Minds were just Jim and Charlie. And then you are working with session musicians, and I think it becomes much more dficult in that scenario to find that spot.Author Graeme Thomson “The band that goes weird is always acclaimed. If you start off quite mainstream and then go weird people see that as a very courageous thing.”Thomson has spoken to most of the original members of Simple Minds in writing his book. Does their reputation matter to them  Do they yearn for the excitement of those early years “Jim is very relaxed now. I think it feels very old to him and he can point to all the success the band has had since then.”“I think they understand why diehard fans love that stuff, but it’s not something they can replicate. It was a very long time ago.” Themes for Great Cities by Graeme Thomson is published by Constable, £"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13462568.jpg?type=article-full","title":"traces-tv-drama-starring-laura-fraser-martin-compston-returns","story":"“But that tiny bone doesn’t change from the womb to the tomb. If you analyse that bone, it will tell you where your mother was living when she was pregnant with you.”McDermid, , can rattle off a raft of intriguing details like this from her encyclopaedic knowledge of forensics, gleaned across  years of plotting novels packed with murder, suspense and insidious deeds.As you might imagine, she has no shortage of fascinating anecdotes. Like the time that anatomist and forensic anthropologist Professor Dame Sue Black taught her how to break the hyoid, a small horseshoe-shaped bone in the neck.Or when forensic chemist Professor Niamh Nic Daeid laid bare the damage that can be wreaked by fires in confined spaces, with a gasp-inducing video clip of a synthetic Christmas tree-turned-towering inferno after an electrical spark ignited its branches.The ear bone McDermid mentions is one such nugget that the Fe-born author plans to incorporate into a book at some point: a tool that could help pinpoint the circumstances of a grisly death or provide important clues about an anonymous murder victim.“The things that are still fascinating to me are what the anthropologists dig up,” she says. “The analysis they can do of your biological material to tell you things like where you lived.”Tantalising titbits like these are woven throughout Traces, the TV drama starring Laura Fraser and Martin Compston, which s to our screens for a second series this week.The crime thriller, co-created by McDermid, focuses on the work of the fictional Scottish Institute of Forensic Science and Anatomyin Dundee. Its twisting plot follows three forensic professionals – Fraser, alongside Molly Windsor and Jenner Spence – as they analyse crime scene evidence.Val McDermid on the set of Traces in Dundee. Picture: Alibi UKTV Traces was inspired by the work of the many remarkable women scientists that McDermid has got to know well over the years.They include the aforementioned Professor Dame Sue Black, currently at Lancaster University, who is world-renowned for her pioneering work at the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identication and the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, both created during her  years at Dundee University.McDermid has also spent time picking the brains of Professor Niamh Nic Daeid, who continues to oversee the ground-breaking research happening in Dundee, alongside colleague and leading forensic anthropologist Professor Lucina Hackman.Professor Dame Sue Black has become world-renowned for her work as an anatomist and a forensic anthropologist. Picture: Morgan SilkWired The Conde Nast Publications Ltd PA When making Traces there was never any doubt in McDermid’s mind that a trio of female scientists should be at the fore. “Right from the start, that was one of the key elements of putting the production together,” she says. “Forensic science is so often led by women. An awful lot of leading forensic scientists are women.“We wanted to make a drama that put women front and centre. Not just the three scientists, but the producers, the exec producers, the directors and much of the cast are female. It was one of the very first completely female-led productions when we made the first series.“That is now almost becoming something that is not worth commenting on, but when we were making the first series of Traces, there wasn’t anything quite like it in terms of the make-up of the team.”: Five great Scottish thrillers and crime novels headed for our TV screens The debut series of Traces, filmed between Dundee and Manchester, aired on Alibi in  and was then shown on BBC One last year. McDermid worked closely with Scott  Bailey actor and writer Amelia Bullmore in developing its premise. They are both thrilled, she says, that it is back for a second run.“It was pretty much the same as the first series,” says McDermid, describing their collaborative process. “We had some basic ideas and brainstormed them. We came up with the basic storyline we wanted to pursue and then Amelia ran with it.“We spent time with Niamh Nic Daeid and Lucina Hackman, the two professors at Dundee. Then essentially, I stepped back, hands off, and let Amelia get on with it. As the script drafts came through, I looked at them to seethere was anything that didn’t make sense to me.”Martin Compston, Molly Windsor, Jenner Spence, Laura Fraser and Michael Nardone in the new series of Traces. Picture: Alibi UKTV Traces being recommissioned for a second series has given them scope to develop the characters and flesh out the storylines. “That’s what you need, otherwise it becomes a dry recitation of the forensics,” says McDermid.“But, believe me, as we go forward through this series, the forensic detail is front and centre again. And it is surprising stuff. We have been very fortunate in that we are working with forensic scientists who are at the leading edge of research and so we are learning about things that are just coming on stream.“I don’t want to say anything in too much detail because …” McDermid purposely trails off. Spoilers  She is keeping tight-lipped. What we do know is that the plot of the new series will centre around a clutch of improvised explosive devices being set off in and around Dundee.Was any inspiration drawn from real-le cases  “No, absolutely not,” says McDermid. “We drew on the forensic experiences of Niamh and Lucina, but in terms of actual cases, no.“It is dficult to say anything about this without it being a spoiler but when people see it, they may jump to the conclusion it is based on something, a real case, but the scripts were all written and in production before that happened.\"That gave us a sharp intake of breath. When le imitates art, it is eerie, but you also have to then ask questions about the material we have and whether it is exploitative in the light of subsequent events.Laura Fraser as Professor Sarah Gordon and Molly Windsor as Emma Hedges. Picture: Alibi UKTV “We looked at it very carefully and we all agreed that it was OK, that we weren’t being exploitative, not least because we had done the work before the event as it were.”Breaking Bad star Laura Fraser plays Professor Sarah Gordon, a forensic chemist at the fictional University of Tayside and director of SIFA.Jenner Spence, known for her roles in Stargate Universe and Continuum, is forensic anthropologist Professor Kathy Torrance, with Three Girls actor Molly Windsor as intrepid lab technician Emma Hedges.How do the real-le scientists McDermid knows feel seeing their line of work depicted on screen  “They are happy with it because we have taken the time to get the detail right. That is what pleases them. That is why they got involved in the first place because we committed to doing it properly.“They have a giggle when they see who is playing them on screen – they find that quite amusing because they are not very like them in real le.”Behind the scenes during filming of Traces series two. Picture: Alibi UKTV The million-pound question, which McDermid has no doubt been asked countless times throughout her career, is why we as readers and TV viewers have such a fascination with crime and forensics. Is it the puzzle, the macabre, the fear, the titillation – or something  “A lot of it is curiosity. We want to know how things work,” she says. “The great thing with forensic science, particularly as it has developed in recent years, is we get answers, and you can see how we got to the answer. I think people find that really satisfying.“Often le events and the world around us doesn’t produce a logical conclusion and answer. The great thing about forensics and crime fiction in general is you get a resolution.\"Or,you don’t get a resolution or an answer, at least you know where you are. When terrible things are happening all around us, it is good to have something that produces the comfort of resolution.”That is something which feels particularly pertinent in the present day. “We have had two years of living in limbo, most of us, not knowing from one month to the next how our lives were going to be,” says McDermid.“It is a comforting space to be in when you are watching a drama, or indeed a true-le series about forensics, to know there are answers out there. We have also in the last couple of years come to understand the importance of the role of scientists developing new ideas and finding solutions.\"It is hard to think back two years when we didn’t have a vaccine – we didn’t even have a test when Covid arrived. But the scientists put their heads down, dug in and came up with the answers. I think that is something we have all become much more aware of and gratied by.“Before all this happened, Michael Gove was going about saying, ‘we have had enough of experts.’ Sorry Michael, you were wrong on that one.”Laura Fraser as Professor Sarah Gordon filming series two of Traces in Dundee. Picture: Alibi UKTV A  study at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign found that women tend to be drawn towards true crime stories more than men, and that they are typically most interested in those that give insight into the killer’s motives, how victims escaped or that feature female victims.Is that something McDermid, who penned the non-fiction guide Forensics: The Anatomy of Crime in , has found from speaking to her readers  “Yes and I think maybe part of it is we are all wanting to be on the alert for the killers in our lives,” she says.“The acts of violence that are committed against women on a daily basis in this country are still staggering and they are usually committed by people who are very close to us. Maybe part of it is we want to be on the alert.”It is a subject that is always forefront of her mind but arguably even more so over the last fortnight. When we speak the furore over Raith Rovers signing David Goodwillie is sending shockwaves across Scotland.A lelong fan of the Fe club, McDermid first stepped up to be the team’s shirt sponsor in . Her late father Jim, a former scout for Raith Rovers, introduced his daughter to football at an early age.After news of Goodwillie’s signing broke, the author announced she was withdrawing her support and sponsorship of the team. The striker, who previously played for Clyde, was ruled to be a rapist and ordered to pay damages in a civil case in .Writing on Twitter, McDermid said: “The thought of the rapist David Goodwillie running out on the pitch at Starks Park in a @RaithRovers shirt with my name on it makes me feel physically sick.”: Val McDermids anger over Goodwillie signing: How could football get it so wrong Raith Rovers has since admitted it was a mistake to sign Goodwillie and confirmed that he will not be playing in any matches. The club has said it is reviewing his contract.McDermid has stood firm and said she will notwhile the player remains on the payroll and those who authorised his signing are still in charge.Testament to how deep her anger and hurt runs, she tells me: “It has been the first time in  years that I have been glad my dad is not here.”Before becoming an author, McDermid spent  years working as a journalist in the late s and through the s. During that time, she covered big stories including Hillsborough, Lockerbie, the “Yorkshire Ripper” case and the aftermath of the Moors Murders.Her latest novel, , s to that world as told through the eyes of protagonist Allie Burns, an ambitious young reporter on the fictional Glasgow newspaper the Daily Clarion. It marked McDermid’s first new series in almost two decades.Crime author Val McDermid’s latest book, , draws from her former career as a journalist.

The three-part drama, Karen Pirie, will see Outlander and Vigil star Lauren Lyle play a young police detective investigating a cold case murder in St Andrews.“We have had to make some changes to the storyline because Karen has a very small role in the book originally,” explains McDermid. “But, also, we are concertinaing almost  years of books into a much tighter time frame because the idea is,this goes well, we will make book after book.“So, the timeline has been shted and the story has been adjusted but essentially the heart of it remains the same. I think what we have ended up with is really good television. Lauren does a fantastic job as Karen Pirie.“Quite a lot of people will look at Lauren in the abstract and think, ‘She doesn’t look like the Karen Pirie in my head …’ but when they see her on screen, they will believe her, trust me.”: Outlander star Lauren Lyle on BBC thriller Vigil and ITV crime drama Karen PirieMcDermid has had cameo roles in Traces and an earlier ITV adaptation Wire In The Blood. Will we see her popping up in Karen Pirie  “No, I don’t think so. To be honest, I am getting typecast,” she deadpans. “I keep turning up as a journalist. I just don’t get the chance to show my range …”She may be spinning multiple plates between her books and TV projects, but McDermid never passes up an opportunity to build on her forensics expertise.“I am looking forward to spending a day with Niamh [Nic Daeid] soon because she has a new set up in Dundee which is essentially a constructed crime scene with model ‘bodies’ – they look real,” she says. “I am hoping to spend a day up there with her going through the crime scene bit by bit.”Professor Niamh Nic Daeid is a forensic chemist involved in ground-breaking research at Dundee University Has McDermid had the chance to do anything like that before  “Crime scenes are not places they let people like me wander about and there are not many opportunities to see something like that which has been so meticulously reconstructed.“What I have seen over the years is something by Frances Glessner Lee, an American heiress, who set up the first forensic lab in the US at Hard [in the s]. She did these things that were called ‘nutshell studies’ of crime.“They were basically small-scale dioramas of crime scenes that were used for training detectives. They are like wee doll’s houses of murder.”: Five great Scottish thrillers and crime novels headed for our TV screens Perhaps in another le McDermid might have embarked upon a career in forensics  “I don’t know,” she muses. “I enjoyed chemistry very much when I was at school. But I’m not sure I have the right temperament for a scientist.“You do need to have enormous patience. And be willing to repeat things endlessly to make sure they are replicable.

Over the past five years, the total cost of repairs was £.m.The revelation has come in the wake of growing anger over a \"waste\" of public money over Scotlands ferry-building fiasco and after state-owned shipyard firm Ferguson Marine admitted there is set to be even more delay and extra cost implications because of cabling concerns on one of two leline ferries being built.MV ArrowThe state-controlled ferry operator CalMac has said it was \"disheartening\" to hear of island communities suffering from the disrupton to services in recent weeks and was doing all it could to reduce the impact.And Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the council covering the Western Isles has accused senior management of CalMac of deciding to “hunker down” away from the islands and breaking a promise to engage with the local authority.New data seen by the Herald reveals that in , before the pandemic hit, around one in  scheduled sailings were cancelled. Out of , sailings just  were cancelled.But since then the rate of cancellations has shot up to just over one in  as concerns surfaced over the viability of the ageing ferry fleet.In , there were , scheduled sailings with  cancellations and in  there were , planned trips with  cancelled.The collapse in August,  of Ferguson Marine Engineeringled by tycoon Jim McColl, which runs the last remaining shipyard on the lower Clyde, came amid soaring costs and delays to the construction of two leline island ferries and resulted in its nationalisation by the Scottish Government.The cost of both vessels has doubled to around £m while their delivery is nearly five years late.Highlands and Islands MSP Edward Mountain, the former convenor of the rural economy and connectivity committee which branded the ferry procurement management process a \"catastrophic failure\" said the figures lay bare the failings of the ferry service and said there should be a full public inquiry.“It has been a year of woe for our island communities, whose daily lives have been disrupted by an aging ferry fleet which is highly susceptible to breakdowns,\" he said. “This new data is yet more proof that the lack of new vessels is having a serious impact on ferry services. The SNP Government have failed to renew the fleet and build resilience into our ferry network.“Many of these ferries are operating beyond their intended lespan. Older boats require more maintenance, but there’s also longer breakdowns and ier repair times too.“No one would expect the First Minister to travel to work in a  year old car, but the SNP Government are expecting islanders to rely on thirty year old ferries.“Island communities are suffering the consequences of the SNP’s lack of forward planning. This is unacceptable and that again is why we need a full public inquiry to investigate this ferry fiasco.”Comhairle nan Eilean Siar has said islands were at \"crisis point as widespread chaos\" engulfed ferry services throughout the Inner and Outer Hebrides in recent days as a result of over-runs in the CalMac dry docking schedule and the breakdown of MV Hebrides.It called for urgent action from Calmac and Scottish Government to ensure leline service is restored and a community voice is listened to.It comes as it emerged problems with the starboard main engine of the -year-old MV Hebrides has meant that the suspension of services to and from Uig on Skye and Lochmaddy in North Uist will last till Sunday. Engineers were carrying out repairs on the vessel which can carry  passengers and  cars on Thursday and CalMac said they were continuing to investigate \"contengency plans\".On Friday four leline services were suspended by pm partly due to weather and partly due to the MV Hebrides breakdown, after three on Thursday and eight the previous day.A substantial amount of emergent steelwork has also been discovered on another of the fleets elderly statesman, the -year-old MV Clansman in dry dock, and this has delayed herby three weeks.But Comhairle nan Eilean Siar has said even when the weather was not bad, ferry breakdowns and delays to new ferries left island communities vulnerable.CalMac has said unforeseen ferry faults have been partly to blame for disruption to leline services in recent weeks which has resulted in islanders raising concerns about empty food shelves.It said: \"We are now well into the third week of extreme and unprecedented weather conditions - one of the longest periods of very poor weather and high signicant wave height for many years,\" the ferry operator said.\"We are experiencing technical faults with some vessels that require urgent repair. In addition, some of our statutory annual overhauls are delayed, while engineers solve unforeseen issues presented during detailed surveys.\"We will continue to work with local communities to ensure their priorities around the transportation of goods and services are understood and supported. Our dedicated frontline staff are talking every day to our regular customers to make sure that essential goods and services are being moved.\"We understand how much our customers and the communities we serve rely on ferry services. Getting ferries working as they should be is our absolute priority, and we thank you for your patience and understanding at what we know is a really dficult time.\"Transport Scotland said Scottish ministers, and the board of state-controlled David MacBrayne Limited, which owns CalMac were listening to islanders.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “We recognise the fragility of some supply chains serving island communities and understand the anxiety that disruption to ferry services can cause.“We are aware of the additional staffing pressures faced by operators due to the Covid pandemic impacting on staff availability because of sickness and self-isolation.“Every effort is made to avoid cancellations and breakdowns, but it is impossible to completely remove the risk of this happening in technically complex vessels. During times of disruption, we always seek to work with operators to deliver additional sailings wherever possible.“We acknowledge the ferry fleet is aging and as such we are delivering new tonnage to support our communities by working with CMAL, CalMac, MSPs, community representatives and others to develop investment programmes - at least £ million over the next five years - for major vessels and small vessels.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"February ,  at : amOrkney could be set for a record-breaking cruise liner season.

He is so resilient, and he had a great game.

We will monitor their progress.”For now, though, Wales can reflect on an impressive comeback after events in Dublin, before all attention switches to England.Elias added: “We had a long hard look at ourselves following the Irish match. There were quite a few areas we wanted to get better at, and one of them was the physicality side of things.“For us forwards it was a case of wanting to front-up physically and get stuck into them .“We’ve got to build on this, and hopefully go up another gear against the English because it is a tough old Test match at Twickenham.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused.

At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league.

Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things.

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it. He added: ldquoIrsquom pleased with the second half performance but certainly not with the first.Looking forward to his sidersquos next match, where they face a tough battle away to Meath, the Down boss said: ldquoWersquoll try to get more men back on the field and we will train hard over the next week to try and improve.ldquoYou canrsquot just sit off for  minutes and expect to still be in games.Down: G McMahon, P Fegan, F McElroy, B McArdle R McCormack, N McParland, D OrsquoHagan A Doherty, O Murdock C Mooney, L Kerr, C McCartanB OrsquoHagan , K McKernan, A Gilmore .Subs: C Poland for D OrsquoHagan, P Havern for K McKernan, J McCartan for C Mooney, C Francis for R McCormick, T Close for N McParland.Yellow Card: J McCartanGalway: C Flaherty K Molloy, S Kelly , S McGrath D McHugh, J Daly, C McDaid P Kelly, M Tierney O Gallagher , R Finnerty , F OrsquoLaoi S Walsh , P Conroy , T Culhane .Subs: D Comerfor R Finnerty, P Kelly for F OrsquoLaoi, T Gill for C McDaid, C Sweeney for T Culhane, D Conneely for P Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Poots.jpg","title":"Ministerial approval for  ambitious park proposal  ","story":"EXCITEMENT is building around the multi-million pound revamp of the stunningly picturesque Castlewellan Forest Park.Work is already underway on an ambitious scheme which will focus on a number of key areas as part of the major investment programme aimed at restoring the sprawling forest parkrsquos key heritage features to help maximise its tourism potential.The Heritage Lottery Fund has provided almost pound.m in assistance with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand the EU weighing in with pound,.Construction work is well underway at the Bothy Yard in the forest park with other planned work including new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park an a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park.There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue and caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.Funding from the government department and Newry, Mourne and Down Council is financing the restoration of the iconic th century greenhouse, reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13460861.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Many of the myths that were established over the five or six years since the referendum have been repeated.By Owen PolleySaturday, th February , : am  \"       \"  An anti-Brexit mock-up of Theresa May steering the good ship Brexit into an iceberg outside the Palace of Westminster Owen Polley argues that many people have misunderstood the reality of Mrs May’s Brexit dealLet’s look at some of the most popular and persistent.First, many people claimed again that an Irish Sea border became inevitable when the UK decided to leave the EU. They said that the protocol is the fault of Brexit supporters, including unionistswho voted for it. Pro-Union leavers should therefore ‘own’ the consequences of their decision and stop complaining.One problem with this logic is that the Republic’s government, under the then-taoiseach Enda Kenny, did not think that a sea border was inevitable in the months following the referendum.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.In fact, Dublin officials began exploring how checks could take place on the land frontier between Northern Ireland and the south.They assumed, quite logically, that any hardening of the border would have to reflect an existing international boundary that had been established for over a century. It is the fact that this did not happen that is extraordinary and unprecedented.More importantly, from a political and moral perspective, unionists had every right to campaign for Brexit, without fear that Northern Ireland would subsequently be wrenched out of important aspects of the Union. Their place in the United Kingdom relies on the ‘principle of consent’, which is supposed to be a central tenet of the Belfast Agreement. Andthat principle means anything at all, voters in Northern Ireland would expect to take part in a nationwide referendum and have its outcome applied here on the same terms as voters where in the UK. You can understand why nationalist parties, that have never convincingly accepted that the principle of consent has consequences, would not grasp this argument. It is more disturbing when some self-declared unionists seem to share their outlook.During the EU referendum, pro-Union people took part in both the ‘remain’ and ‘leave’ campaigns. Afterwards, perfectly reasonably, they took dferent views about what kind of Brexit the UK should pursue.The one point of consensus should have been that any outcome must be UK wide and include Northern Ireland fully.Another piece of received wisdom, repeated constantly, is that the DUP insisted on a ‘hard Brexit’ and rejected every proposal that would have resulted in a ‘softer’ outcome.This is connected to the even more inaccurate claim that Theresa May’s ‘backstop’ deal would have prevented economic barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Admittedly, the DUP’s performance, in the wake of , has been distinctly unimpressive. It spurned the chance to play a constructive role in the UK government after the  election, preferring to boast that it had secured £ billion in funding. It endorsed the ‘joint report’ of December  that entrenched Theresa May’s ‘backstop’, after initially insisting on ineffective changes.And it eventually agreed to a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, before Boris Johnson signed his protocol.However, despite the impression given by MPs like Ian Paisley and Sammy Wilson, the DUP did not insist on a ‘hard Brexit’. The party’s only ‘red line’ was that any deal should treat Northern Ireland the same as the rest of the UK.Its Westminster leader at the time, Nigel Dodds, told the BBC’s Newsnight programme that, given a choice between protecting the Union and delivering Brexit, the DUP would choose the Union.The party rejected Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement because it treated Northern Ireland dferently. Yes, the former prime minister’s aim was to keep the whole UK tied closely to the EU’s single market and customs union which, in the short term, may have prevented disruption to GB-NI trade.But the whole point of the ‘backstop’ was thatthe rest of the UK erged from Brussels’ rules, Northern Ireland would remain tied to the single market and customs union. May was committed to a close relationship with the EU, but her government was hanging by a thread.Her agreement was likely to create every problem subsequently entrenched by the Protocol, as soon as a more eurosceptic administration took power in Westminster.In addition, it removed Northern Ireland officially from the UK’s customs regime and tied it to the EU set-up instead. For the casual observer, a lot of this detail was easy to miss. Consistently, the Westminster government played down problems involved in the withdrawal agreements championed first by Theresa May and then by Boris Johnson. It’s understandable that the DUP’s opponents, and particularly its unionist rivals, want to point out the party’s failures.On the pro-Union side, though, they should be careful to ensure that their criticisms are well-aimed and accurate.There is every danger that, otherwise, they might end up strengthening profoundly anti-unionist arguments and bolstering the position of those who are using Brexit as an excuse to weaken the Union.– Ben Lowry s next weekMore from the News Letter: WATCH – Bid to intimidate ‘orange scum’ out of mixed housing estate fails Click here – RUC ‘collusive’ findings: WATCH as DUP man denounces IRA while speaker Alex Maskey tries to rein him in for ‘going off-topic’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

But we are not removing all the measures at once because the pandemic is not over yet.“To keep Wales safe, we need to remain cautious and do everything we can to reassure those who feel most at risk. We will keep some important protections in place, including face coverings in health and social care settings, on public transport in all shops. We will also keep self-isolation rules in place.”The next review will be held on Thursday, March , and will look at the remaining alert level zero restrictions.“Next month, we will publish a plan setting out how we will move beyond alert level zero and the emergency footing on which we have been operating for nearly two years. This will help us all to make some plans for the future,” said Mr Drakeford.The Welsh Government advise that anyone travelling outside of the UK will need to check the relevant countries’ rules for entry as the international Covid Pass is still in effect. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A post-event queuing system will be in placewith new locations for queues for services to Newport and Gloucester.Colin Lea, planning and performance director at Transport for Wales said: “We look forward to welcoming many thousands of rugby supporters travelling to and from Cardf on our services on Saturday.“It is important to remember we are still in a pandemic and this continues to affect rail services throughout the UK.\"We will be doing everything we can to provide as much capacity as possible to get people into the city and home again, but it is absolutely vital everyone plans ahead and checks the latest travel information before setting out.\"Weather forecasters are predicting a wet and windy afternoon, so customers should wear appropriate clothing, and check for any disruption on the network caused by the weather.“Customers are reminded to wear a face covering for the entirety of their journey, unless exempt.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBute Cottage Nursery is set to merge with Evenlode Primary under Vale of Glamorgan council plans opposed by hundreds.The council’s cabinet was urged to rethink the merger, with some councillors claiming not enough attention was given to a public consultation where most people opposed the plan.Cllr George Carroll, leader of the Conservative group on the Vale council, called in the merger decision to be looked at by the learning and culture scrutiny committee.He said: “That’s a clear and signicant majority of consultees who were opposed to this proposal. Insufficient consideration was made regarding those consultations responses.”The scrutiny committee, which met on Thursday, February , also heard from parents, governors and trade union representatives about their concerns over the merger.Richard Disley, chair of governors at Bute Cottage, said: “It’s been dficult to get our voices heard during this process. Our concerns have always been about the wellbeing of our staff. If the amalgamation happens, the current positions of the majority of nursery staff are only guaranteed for  months.“Long-serving permanent staff members who are in our current budget have job stability, will now only have guaranteed work for  months. Staff haven’t been offered any support from the local authority during this very stressful time.“Bute Cottage should be held up as an example of how things should be done, not merged into a primary school with the sole purpose of fitting into a – year model, for which there is no proof of improved outcomes for children. We have asked for evidence on a number of occasions but none has been forthcoming.”Kate Rees, a parent whose children went to Bute Cottage, said: “It was disappointing that there wasn’t more consideration for the issues we raised. Bute Cottage has its own headteacher, budget, governing body, and specialist staff. Those are the magic ingredients that come together to create the exceptional setting for education..remove“I have three children. All three of them were lucky enough to go to Bute Cottage, and they all attend Evenlode now, and Bute Cottage was just a really wonderful experience for them. I got to know that nursery really well. Because of that I’m absolutely passionate about the provision there.”Concerns over the merger include the possible relocation of the nursery to the Evenlode Primary School site, although this would be several years away and only a potential move and a change in the teaching style. The Vale council has said the merger would help provide continuity and stability for pupils to attend the same school from three to eleven years.Cllr Rhiannon Birch said the concerns were overblown and “disappointing”, and added high teaching standards would be kept after the merger.She said: “They will have the same staff, there will be the same guiding ethos, there will be the same standards of professionalism. To hear some of these speakers, you would think these children are going to be put in a field to poke each other with sticks, rather than having an education.“It’s very disappointing their lack of trust in teaching professionals who will continue to maintain high standards, to provide pastoral care, education and all the dferent aspects of nursery education. It seems to me incredible to believe that all of this should be going out of the window simply because we’re talking about the governing body.”Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said no changes to staff will be made as part of the merger, which would be restricted to how the school and nursery are governed.She said: “A consultation is not a referendum. It’s where we listen to views to see whether there’s any reason why the agreed policy … should not be applied. The nurseries would only be merged at a governance and leadership level, and there would be no change to where they’re operating. Those nurseries are not moving.“There will be no change to staffing or surroundings. There’s no reason to think that anything in terms of teaching and standards of learning in these schools will be altered in any way at all.”Asked about a potential future feasibility study into relocating the nursery next to Evenlode, she said: “Because you would want to see whether you have the best model, and whether it would be betterit were on one site. I’m on record as saying I don’t think it would be feasible.“But there were comments of people who don’t have cars, who live in the Evenlode catchment area, and actually walk from lower Penarth up to the nursery every day and back.“So you have to do a feasibility [study], to see whether or not that would work. But there is such a workload on the st Century Schools team, that unless it was prioritised, it would be a number of years before we could even look at it with the amount of other work.”If approved, the merger of the nursery and the primary school would take effect in September this year. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The land has been allocated for planning within the enterprise zone for a number of years.”As well as building the -hectare business park, the plans involve giving  hectares of farmland to Vale of Glamorgan council, to massively extend the neighbouring Porthkerry Country Park. A corridor of land along Porthkerry Road would also be kept safeguarded, connecting the nearby railway line with Cardf Airport for a potential new train or tram service there.Mr McPhillips said: “We have already agreed the transfer of  hectares of land to the Vale of Glamorgan Council to form an extension to Porthkerry Country Park, for use by the community with added funding for environmental management.“This transfer will provide more public access with connection to the Wales Coastal Path, and access on foot from Porthkerry and Rhoose. From an environmental perspective, this transfer goes beyond mitigation and provides signicant bioersity net gain. There would also be . hectares of green space within the business park.”.removeThe business park would be built on Model Farm, off Port Road, which has been farmed by the Jenkins family for four generations. The family previously said they were “devastated” that they would have to leave the farm, but are hoping to continue their wildflower seed business.Legal and General bought the farm several years ago, and it was earmarked for a major building project in , as part of Vale of Glamorgan council’s local development plan. The site is also in one of eight enterprise zones in Wales, where the Welsh Government is focusing economic development and encouraging businesses to invest.Last summer the Vale council’s planning committee voted to grant permission for the business park at Model Farm. Campaigners then successfully applied for a judicial review, leading to the permission getting quashed. Now, another planning application has been sent to the council, and a public consultation on the plans is running until February .Then in the next few months, councillors on the planning committee will again be asked to vote on whether to approve permission for the business park. The last vote was split along party lines, with nine councillors voting in favour and eight against. With the upcoming local election in May, the political makeup of the committee could change, affecting the next vote.But in the meantime, Legal and General has released new estimates of how Cardf International Business Park could boost the local economy. With overall floorspace of the development covering , square metres, it’s expected the business park could provide space for , full-time employees.Gross value added, which measures local economic output, is expected to be a total of £ million, comprising £ million when the business park is operational and £ million during construction. Building the business park is expected to last a decade, creating  jobs.However, Maxine Levett, a campaigner with Vale Communities Unite, said several questions regarding the plans remain unanswered. She added the business park would be “detrimental” to the community and environment, and was unnecessary with several vacant brownfield sites nearby.She said: “This is a working farm helping feed the community and encouraging bioersity, when the Vale council has declared a climate emergency. The current land available at the Bro St Athans site shows there isn’t a requirement for this type of development, as there are thousands of square metres of brownfield sites waiting to be scooped up.“Who will finance the road works to accommodate the impact of potentially , extra vehicles from this site, on top of additional transport needs from recent residential buildings and the proposed development of Aberthaw power station “Bristol Airport has declared they are increasing their passengers to  million a year. This will greatly impact companies willing to fly out of Cardf Airport. And where is the funding coming from to provide a rail link to a planned transport hub “We will continue to fight this development as we feel it to be detrimental to the community, environment and unnecessary with Aberthaw, St Athan and other locations near to the M corridor better placed to meet employment needs, rather than a working farm.”Contrary to the views of campaigners and some local politicians, Legal and General has claimed it would preserve and enhance the environment. Plans include three kilometres of new hedgerows, and planting five acres of scrub and woodland, as well as extending Porthkerry Country Park.Mr McPhillips said: “Legal and General has been committed to Wales as a progressive investor and substantial employer for many years. This is a project which will increase economic growth and we will continue to pursue the planning viability sensitively with existing stakeholders.“Creating , jobs and investment of £ million must be seen as essential for the future of the Welsh economy, especially next to Cardf Airport. This investment in business infrastructure by Legal and General enhances the Welsh Government’s current major investment in Cardf Airport, a strategic gateway to facilitate international connectivity.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
