But analysis of the data shows something surprising.Some of the lowest vaccination rates are, in fact, in some of wealthiest regions.In Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea, where the average salary is £123,000 (the highest in the UK), 33 per cent of children have not received both MMR jabs.In Barnsley, South Yorkshire, by contrast, the average salary is £29,700 but 95 per cent of children have been fully vaccinated.This suggests that groups of people who are typically highly educated and very much engaged in their families’ health are actively rejecting vaccines.Let me be blunt: some sections of the well-to-do middle classes seem to be turning their backs on treatments we know save lives.What is going on?         In Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea (pictured), where the average salary is £123,000 (the highest in the UK), 33 per cent of children have not received both MMR jabsAs a doctor, I’ve noticed a trend among some wealthier patients: a growing sense that they know best when it comes to their own and their children’s health.Social media has heightened these beliefs, bombarding people who spend time online with misinformation and, often, lies.It is perhaps surprising that well-educated, well-off people seem to be taking such health risks, and I’ve no doubt the parents of Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea want to care for their children as much as anyone else.But the new data clearly shows money doesn’t necessarily matter when it comes to evaluating evidence.(Other, poorer areas of London, such as Hackney, also have low vaccination rates. In part, this can probably be attributed to higher rates of immigration from countries where vaccination is less widespread.)When I was a medical student, I worked for a time alongside a GP who was about to retire.He had the kind of knowledge and experience that can’t be learnt in a lecture or from a medical textbook.He told me how, some years previously, he had been holding a vaccination clinic. This was at the height of the hysteria over possible links — now thoroughly discredited — between the MMR vaccine and autism.To this day, many parents worry that, despite overwhelming evidence of the tremendous benefits of vaccination, it is still somehow risky.The GP had done his best to reassure all his patients, and slowly more parents were having their children immunised.         Social media has heightened these beliefs about MMR, bombarding people who spend time online with misinformation and, often, lies (stock image)One mother, after asking lots of questions, at last agreed for her son to receive the jab.The frightened child was crying, so the doctor had put the boy on his knee. He was just about to administer the vaccine when, suddenly, the lad had a seizure.It didn’t last long but he was sent to hospital without having been given the vaccine.As the GP explained to me, if he had vaccinated the child a minute earlier, the boy would have had the seizure after the vaccine and the mother would, understandably, have been convinced for ever that the vaccine had caused the seizure.She would have told every other parent about her experience and it would have caused great worry and lasting upset.The moral of all this? We must trust in the science, not simply what we want to think is true.Another case I saw as a junior doctor working in A\u0026ampE illustrated to me the vital importance of vaccination.A woman came in with her severely disabled son, who had become ill at home and developed a temperature. He was unable to feed himself, so some time ago a tube had been placed permanently into his stomach, through which he was fed.It had become infected. I listened, puzzled, as his mother kept saying it was all her fault.She explained that the reason her son was severely disabled was because, when he was younger, she had chosen not to have him vaccinated.She would regret this decision for the rest of her life.For most children, measles, mumps and rubella are merely unpleasant. However, for a small but significant minority, they can lead to permanent disability and damage.This woman’s son was particularly unlucky. The infection travelled to his brain — a condition known as encephalitis. There it lay dormant for a year until, finally, it began to do its terrible damage.The boy started to behave strangely and have seizures. He had difficulty moving and speaking. There was no cure.His mum was his sole carer and did the job with admirable dedication and love. She had given up her job to care for him.While the fears around MMR and autism turned out to be false, fears around the infections themselves remain — or should remain — very real.It is therefore vital that children receive the vaccinations they need."},{"url":null,"title":"Iran reports Explosion Iran oil tanker Saudi Arabia","story":"Share this article Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said only that it was carried out by those committing \u0027dangerous adventurism.\u0027Mousavi said that the Sabiti was struck twice in the  of a half hour and an investigation was underway. He added that Iranian tankers have been targeted by \u0027damaging activities\u0027 over recent months in the Red Sea, without elaborating.Russia\u0027s foreign ministry has also said it is too early to assign blame for the attack. Before Friday the Sabiti had not activated its transmitter for 57 days, when it was in the port of Bandar Abbas, but it suddenly began broadcasting its location again shortly after the blasts were reported. Data shows the tanker is fully laden with 1million barrels of oil and is now heading back to the Persian Gulf with a destination of Larak, an island in the Strait of Hormuz.It is unclear what the tanker\u0027s initial destination was. Iranian vessels often turn off their trackers to avoid US sanctions on oil exports.Oil prices surged more than two per cent after the attack, with Brent surging 2.3 percent to $60.46, while West Texas Intermediate jumped 2.1 percent to $54.69.           The Iranian tanker was hit following months of tensions around the Arabian Peninsula which has seen attacks on tankers, drones and oil facilities         Friday\u0027s attack comes after a series of blasts targeting oil tankers belonging to Saudi Arabia and its allies, including on two vessels owned by Japan and Norway in June  (pictured)         America has blamed for the attacks, releasing this image which Washington says shows the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps removing an unexploded mine from one of the tankersPrices had already been rising on growing hopes for a breakthrough in the China-US trade talks.It comes months after a series of attacks on tankers belonging to Saudi Arabia and its allies which were blamed on Iran.In May four tankers - two belonging to Saudi Arabia, one to Norway and one to the UAE - were struck by explosions near the UAE in the Gulf of Oman.An investigation by the UAE, America and France concluded that holes in the vessels were likely caused by explosive charges placed near the waterline.The US said Iran was responsible for the attacks, though may not have directly carried them out.That was followed by more attacks in June on two tankers, this time owned by Japan and Norway, in the same stretch of water.America again accused Iran of being behind the attacks, saying an unexploded limpet mine was found on the side of one of the vessels.The US also released footage which it claimed showed boats belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps returning to one of the ships after the blast to remove and unexploded mine.The attacks led to spiralling tensions around the Gulf which saw Tehran shoot down an American Navy drone, which in turn almost led to the US bombing Iran.President Trump ordered strikes against several IRGC bases, but called them off at the final moment. Tensions rose further last month when a Saudi refinery - the world\u0027s largest - and oil field were hit by drones and missiles, which the kingdom said were fired by IranThe explosions shut down 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of production - more than 5 per cent of global oil supply.              In May another four vessels were hit by explosions in the Gulf of Oman, in an attack that was also blamed on Iran. Pictured is the Norwegian Andrea Victory with a hole in its stern Yemen\u0027s Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks, but a U.S. official said they originated from southwestern Iran. Riyadh blamed Tehran. Iran, which supports the Houthis in Yemen\u0027s war, has denied any involvement.Instability in the region was sparked when Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal, signed under Barack Obama.The deal - which was also backed by European powers including Russia -had promised the regime economic benefits in return for curtailing its nuclear programme in a way that would stop it developing weapons.Trump tore up the deal last year by reimposing crippling sanctions on Iran, prompting Tehran to stop complying with the deal by accelerating its enrichment of uranium and rebuilding stockpiles.The President has said he wants to negotiate a new deal with Tehran, but Iran has refused to enter fresh talks, urging the US to return to the terms of the original deal.While European countries have tried to establish economic measures to skirt the American sanctions, these have been largely ineffective.          On September 14 Saudi Arabia\u0027s largest oil refinery at Abqaiq was hit by explosive-laden drones that Riyadh said came from Iran          Saudi Arabia said it was considering a military response against Iran following the refinery attack, though no official action has yet been taken "},{"url":null,"title":"Top Iranian womens football coach hails lifted ban historic moment","story":"Share this article Khosrowyar explained she had moved to the US a few months ago and had not been able to attend Thursday\u0027s match. \u0027I wish I had been in Iran to witness another historic moment with Iranian women,\u0027 she said, adding that many of her female friends had attended and \u0027loved it\u0027.\u0027The score was so great because of us!\u0027 she joked.On Iran\u0027s conservatively-controlled state television, which carried the match live, shots of the cheering crowd included ecstatic women spectators.The decision to allow women into the game came amid pressure from football\u0027s world governing body Fifa, which had threatened Iran with a ban if it did not permit female supporters in the ground         The decision to allow women into the game came amid pressure from football\u0027s world governing body Fifa, which had threatened Iran with a ban         Female police officers were at the stadium to keep the male and female fans separate during the historic matchIran is the world\u0027s last nation to lift a bar on women at matches after Saudi Arabia recently did so.The decision came after football fan Sahar Khodayari, dubbed \u0027Blue Girl\u0027, died after setting herself on fire in fear of being jailed for dressing up as a boy to attend a match.Her death sparked an outcry, with many calling for Iran to be banned and matches boycotted. Ahead of Qatar 2022, FIFA had pressed Iran to allow women to attend qualifiers.But Iran denied its decision to allow women into Thursday\u0027s match was a result of \u0027foreign pressure.\u0027\u0027The presence of #women in stadiums is due to the internal social demands and government\u0027s support of those demands,\u0027 government spokesman Ali Rabiei tweeted.          Iran is the world\u0027s last nation to lift a bar on women at matches after Saudi Arabia recently did so (pictured: Iranian woman enjoys Thursday\u0027s match against Cambodia)  "},{"url":null,"title":"Shaman trek Moscow exorcise Vladimir Putin vows start journey","story":"Share this article Videos about him started clocking up millions of views.The widower explained: \u0027The aim of what I am doing is to create a different Russia which has to be young, new, and open to the world.\u0027Power has to be with local communities, everybody has to be equal.\u0027It\u0027s time to create new history of planet Earth.\u0027         Locals take photos of the mysterious shaman who was to carry out a holy mission to the Kremlin before he was intercepted              Vladimir Putin was targeted by Russia\u0027s \u0027new Rasputin\u0027 -

The writing had been on the wall, but when it actually went into liquidation, we saw an opportunity to move quickly.          The bill to the Government, which refused to bail out the 178-year-old company, to repatriate the 150,000 customers stranded overseas is expected to exceed £100million\u0027We were the preferred bidder because, I am told, the two others were U.S. private equity firms who wanted to cherry-pick the most profitable shops, while we were willing to take on all of them and the entire staff.\u0027But how can they possibly succeed where Thomas Cook failed? \u0027I don\u0027t want to criticise, but we have a very different business model,\u0027 says John. \u0027We\u0027re not a corporate company with shareholders to answer to, but a family-run business.\u0027Our ethos is customer service and we just believe in looking after our staff, saying thank you to them when they work hard and they do, going that extra mile for our clients.\u0027We hire talented people, place our trust in them, delegate and let them run their stores the way they think best and they repay that trust with results and loyalty.\u0027John is a fan of the internet and, unlike other entrepreneurs, believes the digital travel age need not spell the end for the High Street stores, provided customers know they are receiving a premium service.He adds: \u0027These people who worked for Thomas Cook didn\u0027t do anything wrong one day, the company went into liquidation and their jobs had just gone and we feel very proud to be able to give them their jobs back. A lot of the shops were profitable.\u0027But we wouldn\u0027t be doing this deal out of pure altruism. We are certain we can make a success of it and profit. We don\u0027t hide from that. Profit is not a dirty word. It\u0027s only when you make a profit that you can re-invest and grow the business.\u0027Irene, a successful business consultant and chair of the company, adds: \u0027Seeing the reports of Thomas Cook employees losing their jobs was very upsetting and we were very lucky to be able to step in quickly.         A fiercely private couple, the Hays put their success down to their humble beginnings. Both were born into mining communities\u0027Yes, it was a lot of money, but we\u0027d rather invest in growing the business than buy a yacht or a private jet.\u0027John adds: \u0027I always say to Irene, we\u0027re not skint, but we have a very comfortable lifestyle. We\u0027ve lived in the same house for 16 years, have no desire to leave Sunderland and being based here means we can run a very efficient company with a warm, loyal and hard-working workforce.\u0027I don\u0027t think we have taken a idend from the company for 11 years. All the money we make goes straight back into the business.\u0027Or to help others less fortunate than themselves. The Hays Travel Charitable Foundation has distributed £1.6million to organisations across the UK.What a refreshing change from fat-cats who pay themselves millions while their companies sail towards oblivion, in Thomas Cook\u0027s case stranding 150,000 customers overseas and leaving their employees unable to pay the mortgage.The bill to the Government, which refused to bail out the 178-year-old company, to repatriate them is expected to exceed £100million.\u0027I am not going to criticise,\u0027 says John diplomatically. \u0027Nor do I condone. We just do things differently.\u0027Certainly you can\u0027t imagine the highly remunerated directors of Thomas Cook choosing to holiday with their customers, as the Hayses did in 2015 when they led one of their \u0027Faraway Tours\u0027 to Vietnam.\u0027We met some lovely people and had a wonderful time,\u0027 says Irene. \u0027We love travelling and customer service is at the heart of everything we do. I believe everyone deserves a holiday every year, if not two.\u0027A fiercely private couple, the Hays put their success down to their humble beginnings. Both were born into mining communities.\u0027My father was a joiner in the pit and Irene grew up in a similar community,\u0027 says John, who adds with a proud smile that they have been married \u0027a very long time\u0027.They are proud parents of adult children — one of whom, Helen, used to work for the company — and doting grandparents.\u0027Where I lived in Seaham, we didn\u0027t have an inside toilet until I was 15 and I suppose some people would call it tough or deprived, but it never felt that way because everyone was the same.\u0027A bright and sporty boy, John passed the 11-plus exam and went to grammar school before winning a scholarship to study maths at Pembroke College, Oxford. \u0027I\u0027m very competitive and I love to win. Anyone who plays tennis with me will tell you that,\u0027 he says. \u0027I remember at Oxford we were playing football against Christ Church and I overheard one of them say, \u0027Look out for the tough Geordie playing midfield\u0027.\u0027I looked around and thought I\u0027m as soft as mush, then I realised Oh, he means me, I must be hard! I don\u0027t see myself as hard, just driven. A desire to win.\u0027After completing an MBA, John opened his first branch of Hays at the back of his mother\u0027s childrenswear shop, Peggy\u0027s, in County Durham in 1980.         John says: \u0027Thomas Cook was a great brand and we supported the company as travel partners right up until the end\u0027\u0027My mum had been very generous in giving me space, rent-free, at the back of the shop, but she didn\u0027t want to give away any space for her racks, so to get to the travel agency you had to work your way through a slalom course of dressing gowns, baby grows, socks and dresses.\u0027 John\u0027s father put up an unvarnished garden trellis to ide the travel agency from the shop. The brochure rack was made of chipboard and the counter was an old dressing table covered in laminate. The first year, John admits, was \u0027a nightmare\u0027.They made just £812 and nearly folded when a rival agency opened up across the road, offering customers free taxi rides to the airport. John responded by offering free travel insurance. Today, Hays Travel is the largest independent travel agency in the UK, with 190 shops and 1,900 employees. Last year, its sales hit £1.1billion, bucking the economic trend as more holidaymakers shop for breaks online. To celebrate, the Hays gave every member of staff £100 for every year of service — a gesture which cost them almost £1million.\u0027One of our cleaners has worked for us for 35 years and she wept, telling me she\u0027d never had so much money in her account before,\u0027 says Irene, who was awarded a CBE in 2008 and last year received a Lifetime Achievement Award from her local business community.She was given the award for her work as chief executive of South Tyneside and Sunderland City councils but, during her 42-year career, she has also been key in the private sector, working with Japanese car-maker Nissan, which has a plant in the city.John adds: \u0027We just wanted to say thank you to our staff, regardless of whether they were junior or senior. The next day people told us they\u0027d stayed up till one minute past midnight just so they could open their accounts and see the money.\u0027We also had a party to celebrate. We do like our parties. Any excuse for a party. It\u0027s part of our culture, something about Sunderland, but also a simple way of saying thank you to our staff whose mantra is no bother which is Sunderland for yes, I can do that for you.John and Irene\u0027s annual staff parties are legendary. \u0027We started them 30 years ago when we had just two shops and ten staff,\u0027 says John. \u0027We invited them to our house for a barbecue and I think eight turned up.\u0027Irene adds: \u0027In the early years, I used to cook chilli con carne and garlic bread, but now it\u0027s grown far too big for that.\u0027Since moving into their home in the South Tyneside village of Whitburn, bought for a relatively modest £685,000 in 2002, their parties have been held in their large garden on the first Sunday of July. This year, almost 600 employees attended.\u0027Every year, I think it\u0027s going to pour with rain, but it never does, which is just remarkable,\u0027 says John, who this year entertained guests with a lively performance of Oasis\u0027s Wonderwall.\u0027We have a hog roast, live bands, prosecco and Pimm\u0027s and Irene and I go round pouring everyone\u0027s drinks. It\u0027s always a great day and our way of showing thanks.\u0027We all know they could put on their coats at 5.30pm on the dot and go home, but if they have a client in front of them they will stay late. We don\u0027t make them — they want to because the customer is everything.\u0027In a service industry, to have that dedication is just huge, so we do a lot of things to say thank you for behaving in that way.\u0027The Thomas Cook staff given a lifeline by John and Irene must be looking forward to the next party — if they can all fit in the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"Struggling stores slash prices 90 cent panic win customers","story":"Share this article With Black Friday sales approaching on November 29, stores will now only sell products at full price for a few weeks before the post-Christmas sales begin, retail experts said.Jason Gordon, of Deloitte, said: ‘The mid-season autumn sales did start earlier this year and they have run on for longer.‘Whereas traditionally we might expect to see discounts between 30 and 70 per cent, over the last year we are seeing discounts anywhere between 10 and 90 per cent.’         This year Debenhams – which last month announced it would close 22 stores – is offering discounts of 90 per cent         Marks and Spencer was offering up to 90 per cent off at the end of its two-week sale, which finished last week.

I’m playing with the idea of comedy and tragedy – the masks of ancient Greek theatre’As an actor, and coming from a family in entertainment, I’ve spent pretty much my whole life on set. But what a lot of people don’t realise is just how much downtime you have between scenes. Photographing those moments became a way of documenting my life and the lives of people around me, like a personal archive.Ten years ago, I had just finished filming Crazy Heart when I got a call from George Clooney pitching me his new film, The Men Who Stare at Goats. I was exhausted, but it was such a crazy idea I was immediately interested. When I started to explore it in a little more depth, I knew I had to do it, and off we went into this crazy thing together.I had never met George before, but he was splendid to work with and for. He produced the film and starred in it, and we had such a great time making it. He created such a relaxed atmosphere on set. As this picture shows, he’s playful – an entertainer who’s game for pretty much anything.I shoot on a Widelux, a mechanical swing-lens panoramic camera, which is how I got this doubling effect. I get George in the far left of the viewfinder, then as the shot is exposing, I shout “shift!” at which point he turns his face and makes his sad face. The actor doesn’t move across or anything, they just turn their head.This image is part of a series of photographs that plays with the idea of comedy and tragedy and the masks of ancient Greek theatre. Partly, it’s a way of me exploring what is to be an actor, and tapping into the thrill of acting as I see it: the chance to represent what it means to be a human being – the extreme joy and sadness that make us human. But it also speaks to the masks we all wear in different situations.I’ve always been interested in photography. As a kid I played with my dad’s Nikon, and when he installed a darkroom in our house I loved getting into the technical side of it and seeing what shots would come out of the soup. The first wide-lens camera I had was a wedding gift from my wife, and I’ve shot pretty exclusively on Widelux cameras ever since.I started shooting on set during the filming of King Kong in the 1970s. My character had a Nikon strapped around his neck, so I thought I might as well use it. I guess it started out as part of my character but it became this passion.I used to get mad at myself for taking photos, or playing music, or writing songs, or pouring myself into any creative pursuit that wasn’t acting. I would berate myself that it was a waste of time, that I should focus on one thing. But I’ve come to realise that creativity feeds creativity – it’s all part of the same thing and that you should give yourself time to explore your passions.Shooting on set is a pretty amazing thing. First, because the lighting is spectacular. And second, you’re shooting people who know how to interact with a camera. For me and a lot of actors, even being around a camera changes something in your chemistry.I never intended to publish these shots. Originally, I did it so I could make little books for the cast and crew to remember the experience and time we spent together. Usually, at the first script reading or the producers’ meeting, I’ll ask if people are OK with me shooting backstage. They tend to be pretty cool with it.But it felt as if I should share the work with the world. It’s a way of giving something back to the motion picture industry that has been such a wonderful home to me for decades.• Jeff Bridges: Pictures Volume 2 is published by powerHouse Books on 15 October.High point: “The joy of developing an image that completely exceeds your expectations.”Low point: “Getting your photos and finding that they’re disappointing or not quite right, somehow.”Top tip: “Keep your fingers out of the shot!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b18ea73d463e53fb6121653ef5ad7faf975e9c72/145_0_3848_2309/master/3848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f063e3f7a73729b795d5137b98d3455","title":"buy a classic guardian photograph blackpool 2007","story":"Our weekly series of exclusive  print sales continues with a flock of birds in flight over Blackpool beach at sunset, photographed by Graeme Robertson, October 2007Blackpool beach is captured here at low tide by  photographer Graeme Robertson, the setting sun casting a bewitching, painterly light across the scene.

He talks to John Banville about our ‘dismal statesmanship’ and what he learned from his time as a spyI have always admired John le Carré. Not always without envy – so many bestsellers! – but in wonderment at the fact that the work of an artist of such high literary accomplishment should have achieved such wide appeal among readers. That le Carré, otherwise David Cornwell, has chosen to set his novels almost exclusively in the world of espionage has allowed certain critics to dismiss him as essentially unserious, a mere entertainer. But with at least two of his books, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1963) and A Perfect Spy (1986), he has written masterpieces that will endure.Which other writer could have produced novels of such consistent quality over a career ning almost 60 years, since Call for the Dead in 1961, to his latest, Agent Running in the Field, which he is about to publish at the age of 87. And while he has hinted that this is to be his final book, I am prepared to bet that he is not done yet. He is just as intellectually vigorous and as politically aware as he has been at any time throughout his long life. In the new book there is a plotline that is predicated on covert collusion between Trump’s US and the British security services with the aim of undermining the democratic institutions of the European Union. “It’s horribly plausible,” he says, with some relish when we meet in his Hampstead home. His relish is for the fictional conceit, not its horrible plausibility, and at once his conman father pops up with his large-browed head and his all too plausible grin. Ronald “Ronnie” Cornwell was a confidence trickster of genius, of whom his son is still in awe, and to whose exploits and influence he returns again and again, to the point of bemused obsession. “I’ve had the good fortune in life,” says le Carré, “to be born with a subject” – no, not the cold war, which many foolishly imagined was his only topic – “the extraordinary, the insatiable criminality of my father and the people he had around him. I Googled him the other day and under ‘profession’ it said: ‘Associate of the Kray brothers’.” This gives us both a laugh, though a queasy one.“A ceaseless procession of fascinating people” wound its felonious way through his childhood. In his earliest days he was “relieved of any real concept of truth. Truth was what you got away with.” All too familiar to him, then, are the frauds who have swaggered their way into the spotlight in today’s political pantomime.It seems to le Carré now entirely natural that escape from the toxic background of his childhood should have been entry into “severe institutions”. He was sent to his first boarding school at the age of five – “and I did five years straight of stir”. He went on to Sherborne school in Dorset, which he hated – in later years the head of the Secret Intelligence Service, David Spedding, told him that what he most admired him for was the fact that “you ran away from Sherborne while I stayed the course”. Spedding’s rueful warmth is in marked contrast to the recent attack on le Carré by another former head of MI6, Richard Dearlove, who last month at a literary festival in Cliveden – of all places – said the writer was “obsessed” with his brief time as a spy, which he had used as a basis for novels that reveal him to be “so corrosive in his view of MI6 that most SIS officers are pretty angry with him”.For all his sufferings under the educational system of the day, boarding school was for le Carré “one route in the search for some sort of clarity about behaviour”. Then came “the glide into the secret world”: at Oxford he was approached by the security services and did some spying, and informing, on his fellow students of the left-leaning sort, something of which he does not repent. John le Carré, or better say David Cornwell, is at heart an old-fashioned, romantic English patriot. For all that, he is not deluded about the mores of the “secret world”. The security services fixed on their candidates “for being on the one hand larcenous” – a favourite word – “and on the other hand, however you call it, loyal”. This dichotomy raised “huge, many-faceted questions”, for instance what distinguishes patriotism, good, from nationalism, bad. That particular question “kicked around in me ever after. It remains unresolved.”I mention a passage in Agent Running in the Field in which the protagonist Nat, short for Anatoly, a middle-aged, Russo-English secret agent, is watching on screen a surveillance operation being carried out in the streets of London, and is suddenly, and surprisingly, seized with admiration for his country and its people: “multi-ethnic kids playing improvised netball, girls in summer dresses basking in rays of the endless sun, old folk sauntering arm-in-arm ... ” The irony, as Nat cannot but be aware, is that about 100 of these innocent-seeming folk, including the friendly police officer who “strolls comfortably among them”, are in fact British agents busy about their clandestine work. Freedom is fragile, and must be protected by all available means, even the tainted ones.Le Carré speaks of his grandchildren who are “all appalled by Brexit and the concept that freedom of movement is being taken from them, and so on. I say: ‘Look, actually, you have lived in many foreign cities, and you know that you will never get better conversation, a greater sophistication, more ease of social contact, than in London or in Britain altogether.’”I tell him that I lived in London for a year at the end of the 1960s and, coming from an Ireland that in those days was still firmly locked in the stranglehold of the Catholic church, I was endlessly surprised by the freedom of movement that was allowed to me, especially up and down the rungs of the infinitely graduated English class system. “Ah, yes,” he says, with a melancholy smile, “but you were not branded on the tongue.”In Cornwall, where he and his wife, Jane, live for a good part of the year, “dealing with traders, and going to cafes and so on, I find that nobody knows, or cares, who I am”. This is, he feels, an example of “the absolute ease of association” there is in at least that part of England, where there is “a real sense of democracy”.I agree with him, though perhaps not wholeheartedly – I am Irish, after all – on the British commitment to liberal values and the civilised life. But surely all that is now at risk, with the country so ided on Europe?“Yes it is, because in the first place reason has no natural voice. Mob orators of the sort we have, the Boris Johnson sort, do not speak reason. When you get into that category, your task is to fire up the people with nostalgia, with anger. It’s almost unbelievable that these people of the establishment – Farage, for instance – are speaking of betrayal: ‘I’m betrayed by parliament, betrayed by government – I’m speaking to you as a betrayed person, and I’m a man of the people like you.’”He is profoundly worried by the present state of his country. Johnson and his svengali, Dominic Cummings, are running what le Carré recognises as a highly sophisticated propaganda campaign to convince the people that they are their true champions, arrayed with them against the power of parliament and the political elite. This, he says, is a breathtaking sleight of hand that could bring about serious civil disorder. “And absolutely the most terrifying thing that could happen is that the EU should cave in on some minor point regarding the backstop, Johnson blows the dust off May’s withdrawal agreement, adds his own spin, claims a great victory, gets it through a frightened parliament, and rules for eight years.”Yet all is not bleakness and cause for ire. “I think everything is controllable if the social contract is restored. You cannot preach a level playing field in this country as long as you have such exclusive institutions as private education, private medicine, private everything.” There is also the pervasive and pernicious influence of what have come to be called social media – though how far they are truly “social” is moot. “People are shown so many treats, and urged as to what to buy and what to wear and where to travel to, all of which pumps up a spurious notion of the perfect life.”How to combat these dangerous fantasies? “I believe we have to do the things that other countries do pretty painlessly. We have to have a wealth tax, we have to limit hugely the amount of inherited wealth anyone can receive. And none of these things has happened.”But who would make them happen?“Well, we have an extraordinary situation with our Labour party, if they do get in and they can shed Corbyn – I think Corbyn would quite like to go, actually – but they have this Leninist element and they have this huge appetite to level society. I’ve always believed, though ironically it’s not the way I’ve voted, that it’s compassionate conservatism that in the end could, for example, integrate the private schooling system. If you do it from the left you will seem to be acting out of resentment do it from the right and it looks like good social organisation.”I tentatively suggest that by this stage we might sound like two crusty old codgers being sentimental about an imaginary golden age. He ponders this for a while, then sets off on a tangential tack. “You could say that with the demise of the working class we saw also the demise of an established social order, based on the stability of ancient class structures. And then, the working class had the experience of war, but one can count the years when one by one people with war experience disappeared from politics and were replaced, in the main, by people with no idea of human conflict.” And he adds, with straight-faced understatement: “Human conflict has a sobering effect.”To hear Brexiters claiming that Britain won the war single-handedly is, he says, “emetic”. “The wonderful rightwing military historian Max Hastings points out that we were bad fighters, that we were extremely badly organised, and our contribution in terms of blood and wealth and material was – I can’t say trivial, but tremendously small by comparison to the sacrifices of the other major powers. Russia lost, what, 30 million men? And in treasure, heaven knows what. We didn’t win the war in that sense. We were on the winning side by the end, but we were really quite minor players.”His attitude to Brexit is pungently expressed in the new novel. “It is my considered opinion,” one of the characters declares to Nat, “that for Britain and Europe, and for liberal democracy across the entire world as a whole, Britain’s departure from the European Union in the time of Donald Trump, and Britain’s consequent unqualified dependence on the United States in an era when the US is heading straight down the road to institutional racism and neo-fascism, is an unmitigated clusterfuck bar none.”You can’t say plainer than that, even if you have made yourself safe by putting the speech into the mouth of one of your invented creatures. Le Carré says squarely of Agent Running in the Field that “to me it’s quite an angry book”. But certainly it is more, and happily less, than a political rant.“I didn’t want it to be a Brexit novel. I wanted it to be readable and comic. I wanted people to get a good laugh out of it. But if one has the impertinence to propose a message, then the book’s message is that our concept of patriotism and nationalism – our concept of where to place our loyalties, collectively and inidually – is now utterly mysterious. I think Brexit is totally irrational, that it’s evidence of dismal statesmanship on our part, and lousy diplomatic performances. Things that were wrong with Europe could be changed from inside Europe.” He pauses, then goes on, less in anger than in sadness. “I think my own ties to England were hugely loosened over the last few years. And it’s a kind of liberation, if a sad kind.”It was in this spirit that he and wife, Jane, paid a visit recently to Ireland, Jane to delve again among her own roots in Ulster, and David to visit the house in West Cork where his paternal grandmother was raised. He consulted a local archivist for information on the family. “After spending silent minutes at her computer, she looked up with a charming smile and said: ‘Welcome home.’”I suggest that Agent Running in the Field is affirmative of the small pleasures of life, which makes the book very enjoyable. Well, he is careful to remind me again, the voice that speaks in it is not that of John le Carré, and certainly not of David Cornwell, but of Nat, the narrator. “When you’re challenged about the behaviour of characters in your own novels,” he asks me, “do you feel obliged to defend their behaviour?” My answer is that I am no more responsible for them than I am responsible for the people in my dreams. This gets a nod of assent.Besides Nat, the two other leading characters in the book, the gangly Ed and the beautiful Florence – I notice that the women in le Carré’s books become lovelier, and younger, the older the author gets – are essentially decent people. As such, surely they are something of an anomaly? In his reply he seems to agree. “If you’re putting together a secret service you’re looking for people who can charm, who can persuade, and who are not burdened with too much moral sense. People are naturally larcenous and sufficiently hypocritical to appear virtuous and loyal, so actually you are looking for people who are almost by definition capable of betraying you.” Hence by the end of the book the decent people in it have to be put away in a place of safety.What of his own origins as a secret agent? “From the moment I went to boarding schools I was learning to be a gent” – nice little pun – “I had none of the attitudes of the ruling class to keep me going. I didn’t have a pony, that kind of thing. My dad for part of my childhood was in prison. So I arrived in the heartland of the establishment – private education – as a kind of spy, as somebody who had to put on the uniform, affect a voice and attitudes, and give myself a background I didn’t have. And so it was a forced assimilation and I became fascinated by the class I was pretending to be a member of. And it’s no surprise to me that although I loathed my public school I ended up teaching at Eton, and it’s no surprise to me now that I was so fascinated by the interior motor of British society, and that I was drawn to what I believe is the secret centre of our administration.”Did being a spy give him a sense of belonging, of finally finding a workable identity for himself? “Looking really – in some Faustian sense, God help me – for what the world holds at its innermost point, was a way of asking, what are we? Who were we? Which is probably an extension of the question, who the hell am I? Where is virtue to be found? Where is the altar of Englishness? And I think that really was quite a severe internal journey, and a very interesting one, in retrospect: a lost boy in search of something or other.”But when he was a member of the security services did he feel he was in touch with the real world, as distinct from the fantasised one in which the majority of us blithely live? “Please remember, I was a very junior figure in both MI5 and MI6. So much of what in my novels is assumed to be interior knowledge is really imagined stuff. But when I was allowed to attend operational meetings I heard what bigger animals than I were getting up to, and so by the time I got out of that world – with great relief – I had a really big treasure chest of imagined operations, which were based on glimpses of the reality. But I never did anything of the least value in that world.”The aftermath of the secret life contained moments of rich comedy. Yevgeny Primakov – former head of the KGB, “who was within a hair’s breadth of getting Putin’s job” – came to Britain for an official visit, at the end of which his one request was to meet le Carré.“And so Jane and I found ourselves in the Russian embassy surrounded by Russians, with Primakov in front of me. He was an extremely intelligent man, quite a humanist, though at the age of 18 he was already working with the NKVD, later to become the KGB. He was charming and we had a wonderful time together, but I was so in above my pay rate that it was ridiculous. He imagined somehow that the author of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold was a colleague in sophistication. And that sometimes happens to me still. People insist that I know things that I have absolutely no knowledge of, and never did have.”We speak about his later books, set among the super-rich, in nasty foreign wars, in battles with the international pharmaceutical industry. It is apparent that he is proud of this work, and of his support for the forces of decency, such as they are. This brings us back, inevitably, to the enigma that is his father. “I puzzle hugely about his motivation. You ask me what was fun for him. I think what was fun for him were the great confidence tricks he pulled off.”Did this not make Ronnie an artist, of a kind?“This is the thing that fascinates me, of course: am I simply the lucky version of him?”If so, it is we, John le Carré’s readers, who are the lucky ones• John le Carré’s Agent Running in the Field is published by Viking (£20).

Under the motto “we blog because we care”, Zone 9 sets out to create a space for freedom of expression, where iniduals can speak out against human rights violations in Ethiopia.Sissay chose Hailu as the PEN Pinter international writer of courage, calling him “a man who stands by his word and whose words stood in the face of prison and arose far, far above to declaim in the name of humanity”.“When I was considering him, I spoke to many Ethiopians in Ethiopia about him,” Sissay said. “He is loved by his people and the younger generation: He is a 21st-century hero. It was obvious that the writer of courage had to be him. He is my hero.”Speaking in Amharic at the British Library event, Hailu thanked Sissay for choosing him to share the award. Hailu said he had wasted “596 days of his life in prison as a result of his writing”, as well as being “a victim of surveillance, intimidation, beatings and insults”.“But I can say confidently that I have gained rather than lost by writing,” he said. “My wish is to use my voice for the service of the suppressed, those who are victimised because of sexual orientation, creed, religion or political opinion. My dream will come true. My wish is to give my voice to the service of the voiceless, who spoke for me when I could not. I pay it back only when I write to become a voice for the voiceless, the unheard.”The PEN Pinter award goes to a writer who is deemed to, in the words of Harold Pinter’s Nobel speech, cast an “unflinching, unswerving” gaze upon the world, and show a “fierce intellectual determination … to define the real truth of our lives and our societies”. Sissay, who was announced as recipient in June, was described by judges as “an Orpheus who never stops singing”, who in every work “returns to the underworld he inhabited as an unclaimed child”, and “from his sorrows … forges beautiful words and a thousand reasons to live and love”. Sissay grew up in foster care in Wigan and his childhood was scarred by racist bullying.The prize is shared with an international writer of courage who has been persecuted for speaking out about their beliefs.

That is the sharpest two-day rise in the pound since the EU referendum more than three years ago.While several pitfalls remain, the pound also hit a near five-month high against the euro of €1.1465.Oliver Harvey, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: “We cannot recall a time during the Brexit process of the last year at which the Irish government raised expectations to this extent.”The surge in the pound on Friday pushed it back above $1.26 for the first time since Boris Johnson became leader of the Conservative party.Dean Turner, economist at the Swiss bank UBS, said a Brexit extension and general election was still probably the most likely outcome. He said the pound would trade between $1.25-$1.29 under such a scenario, but could soar to $1.35 if an eleventh-hour deal was struck, or tumble should talks break down.“The news will have cheered sterling investors, but we recommend they remain nimble with much still uncertain as the sand in the Brexit hourglass continues to run down,” he said.Shares in UK-focused companies also surged on Friday, on hopes that a disorderly Brexit could be avoided.“The optimism surrounding Brexit has given British banks a boost as UK government bond yields have ticked up, bank’s lending margins usually improve in an environment of higher bond yields, hence why RBS, Lloyds, Barclays and HSBS are higher today,” explained David Madden of CMC markets.“The fear of a disorderly Brexit has been hanging over the property sector,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ff386b7a78c9e3de7f8fe09a54b227039ab0637/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a3c52bc0da092c72e7bdb78fac7dde3","title":"were no country bumpkins meet the thomas cook buyers","story":"John and Irene Hays discuss their down to earth business approach John and Irene Hays, the husband and wife team who bought Thomas Cook’s 555 high street travel agencies this week, are keen to stress that beneath their folksy charm lies steely resolve and razor-sharp business acumen.“People have portrayed us as country bumpkins,” says John, 70, who founded Sunderland-based Hays Travel from the back of his mother’s childrenswear shop in 1980. “We’ll see what they think in a couple of years’ time.”The pair have a Herculean task ahead of them, picking up at least some of the pieces left over from one of the worst corporate failures in UK history.The demise of Thomas Cook has so far resulted in 8,123 redundancies. The official receiver is still paying 931 staff to help with the wind down. But the Hayses now want to recruit around 2,500 of those who have lost their jobs, quadrupling the size of their business in the process.It’s a daunting prospect but the reality is that the couple behind this family-run operation, which unlike Thomas Cook is profitable and free of debt, are nobody’s fools.“My husband is a clever boy, he’s got a brain the size of an elephant,” says Irene, 65, who chairs the business.The evidence from the last few weeks – and their four decades in business – suggests she and her husband know exactly what they are doing. In the final stage of negotiations, they triumphed over two US private equity companies to take control of Thomas Cook’s high street network for an undisclosed sum.The eventual deal followed three weeks of day and night talks with government-appointed accountancy firm KPMG and estate agent Savills, who were armed with an army of lawyers.John and Irene had to provide evidence of their financial resilience to the Civil Aviation Authority, opening up Hays Travel’s books to rigorous stress testing.But the pair, who arrive unaccompanied by the usual public relations minders, acknowledge that for all their deal-making acuity, they are slightly different animals to the usual big beasts of industry.“There have been lots of stories about Thomas Cook being a bad example of capitalism – corporate greed, excessive overheads and excessive debt,” says John. “A lot of that is justified.“We’ve got a very different form of capitalism. We own the business between us, we’re owner-managers who empower our staff and we’ve got no debt.“We haven’t taken a idend for a while because we’re not skint. We’ve got a pleasant lifestyle but we don’t want yachts or anything.”Some of their own family members work for the business, although they’d rather not say who. And as the deal was being hammered out, they fretted not just about knotty contractual issues but also about the domestic harmony of their lead property lawyer.Her husband – a die-hard Newcastle United fan – had to miss his team’s unexpected victory over Manchester United to look after the children while she worked.“We were hoping they’d get hammered, so he’d say ‘Never mind pet, glad I missed it’,” says John, who was also presumably hoping Newcastle lost having served as vice-chairman of arch-rivals Sunderland AFC.As refreshing as their approach to their work might be, the feeling among some observers is that it may not be enough.The prevailing wisdom is that package holidays bought via a travel agent sitting behind a desk are a thing of the past in the internet age. In the immediate aftermath of Thomas Cook’s implosion, Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary declared the package holiday “dead”.Irene points to figures showing that the number of packages sold each year is actually rising, dismissing the language deployed by the Irish airline boss as “sloppy”.“He thinks it’s just a package holiday to Benidorm.”What Hays offers, the duo explain, could be a week in Benidorm, but it could also be a city break with opera tickets or a cruise up the Ganges complete with informative lectures, which is what they’re planning for their own Christmas break. They’re all packages of one sort of another.John says customers like the security afforded by the Atol scheme, which covers the cost of package deals when something goes wrong. As well as the benefit of such protection, he says tour operators such as Hays retain customers by going the extra mile.“The lightbulb moment was Hurricane Sandy, the snowstorm that closed New York for four days. We had about 1,000 clients there and we fed and watered them at our expense. One couple had a suite in the Waldorf Astoria and stayed on for an extra four days. It was eye-watering.”“They were one of the first people to be flown home, it has to be said,” Irene admits.While John is the tourism veteran, Irene – who has been chief executive of two local authorities and served as a government adviser for three years – is equally business-minded.She lists Hays’ advantages over Thomas Cook, including the absence of high fixed costs associated with things such as a glamorous headquarters and stock market listing.The management structure is also much flatter, with fewer steps of removal between the board and the shop floor. “Thomas Cook had a huge hierarchy, whereas we’re really close to our people,” she says. “I know people don’t think that can be done at scale, but it can.“We’ll hopefully sell more holidays than Thomas Cook too because we’re neutral about who we sell,” she adds, offering the example of Jet2, a holiday company whose packages the Thomas Cook agencies refused to offer.“There were people walking in wanting to book a holiday and Thomas Cook wouldn’t do it.”John acknowledges there is some surgery to do on Thomas Cook, whose brand was so tainted by the end that he wasn’t interested in buying the name to go along with the shops.There will be cost-cutting, some of it via renegotiation of rents with landlords, after a nine-month period in which lease agreements are locked in.There is also some duplication to address, with 49 Thomas Cook stores on the same street, or near, existing Hays outlets. “We’ve taken the view that we’ll run both shops on the same high street now and hopefully they’ll stay profitable,” he says.Some may close but he insists “there wouldn’t be job losses”.One of the ways in which Hays foster loyalty among their new staff is via a longstanding scheme to give shop staff a few hundred pounds to invest in local community projects. In one case, that involved funding a hedgehog hospital.“The kids didn’t like seeing the little hedgehogs limping along, or squashed, on their way to school,” Irene says.Those ex-Thomas Cook staff who join Hays are in for something a bit different."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc96271984cffb2d7f531ac9fae6af5a790dcaf0/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=246a149587da4957781c6592a06815ca","title":"inside copenhagens race to be the first carbon neutral city","story":"Green growth and ‘hedonistic sustainability’ have helped keep the public on board as the Danish capital seeks to reach its goal by 2025 – and so far it’s all going according to plan“We call it hedonistic sustainability,” says Jacob Simonsen of the decision to put an artificial ski slope on the roof of the £485m Amager Resource Centre (Arc), Copenhagen’s cutting-edge new waste-to-energy power plant. “It’s not just good for the environment, it’s good for life.”Skiing is just one of the activities that Simonsen, Arc’s chief executive, and Bjarke Ingels, its lead architect, hope will enhance the latest jewel in Copenhagen’s sustainability crown. The incinerator building also incorporates hiking and running trails, a street fitness gym and the world’s highest outdoor climbing wall, an 85-metre “natural mountain” complete with overhangs that rises the full height of the main structure.It’s all part of Copenhagen’s plan to be net carbon-neutral by 2025. Even now, after a summer that saw wildfires ravage the Arctic Circle and ice sheets in Greenland suffer near-record levels of melt, the goal seems ambitious. In 2009, when the project was formulated, it was positively revolutionary.Radical and far-reaching, the scheme dared to rethink the very infrastructure underpinning the city. There’s still not a climate project anywhere else in the world that comes close.The sentiment that lies behind Arc’s conception as a multi-use public good – “hedonistic sustainability” – is echoed by Bo Asmus Kjeldgaard, former mayor of Copenhagen for the environment and the man originally tasked, back in 2010, with making the plan a reality.“We combined life quality with sustainability and called it ‘liveability’,” says Kjeldgaard, now CEO of his own climate adaptation company, Greenovation. “We succeeded in building a good narrative around this, one that everybody could believe in.”The idea was first floated in the late 1990s, when the newly elected Kjeldgaard had a vision of Copenhagen as the environmental capital of Europe. His enthusiasm ran into political intransigence, however, and despite some success, a lack of budget meant most of his work became “just another branding exercise – it was greenwashing”.But after stints as mayor of family and the labour market, and children and young people, he ended up back at environment in 2010 with renewed determination and, crucially, a broader mandate from the city council. “I said: ‘This time, we have to do it right,’” he recalls, “so we made detailed, concrete plans for every area, set the carbon target, and demanded the money and the manpower to make it a reality.”The onus placed on ordinary Copenhageners to walk and cycle more, pay higher taxes (especially on cars) and put up with the inconvenience of infrastructure construction has generally been met with understanding and good grace. And while some people remain critical of the fact that Copenhagen airport is not factored into the CO2 calculations – it lies beyond the city’s boundaries – and grumble about precise definitions and formulae, dissent has been rare.This relative lack of nimbyism and carping about change can, says Frank Jensen, the city’s lord mayor, be traced to longstanding political traditions.“Caring for the environment and taking responsibility for society in general has been an integral part of the upbringing of many Danes,” he says. “Moreover, there is a general awareness that climate change now calls for immediate, ambitious and collective action.” A 2018 survey by Concito, a thinktank, found that such action was a top priority for voters.Many businesses around the world have typically been reluctant to embrace sustainability when a dip in profits or inconvenience might be the result, but not in Copenhagen. Martin Manthorpe, director of strategy, business development and public affairs at NCC, one of Scandinavia’s largest construction and industrial groups, was brought in early on by Abildgaard to represent industry on the municipality’s climate panel, and to facilitate discussions with the wider business community. He thinks there are several reasons why.“The Danes have a trading mindset, meaning ‘What will I have to sell tomorrow?’ is just as important as ‘What am I producing today?’” he says. “Also, many big Danish companies are still ultimately family-owned, so the culture leans more towards long-term thinking.”It is, he says, natural for business to be concerned with issues around sustainability and be willing to endure short-term pain: “To do responsible, long-term business, you need to see yourself as part of the larger puzzle that is called ‘society’.”Furthermore, in Denmark climate change denial is given extremely short shrift. “We believe in the science,” says Anders Haugaard, a local entrepreneur. “Why wouldn’t you? We’re told sustainability brings only benefits and we’ve got no reason to be suspicious.”“No one would dare argue against the environment,” says his friend Claus Nielsen, a furniture maker and designer. “We’re such a rich country – change should be easy for us.” Nielsen talks about how enlightened his kids are – “my 11-year-old daughter is now a flexitarian” – and says that nowadays he mainly buys organic Haugaard doesn’t see a problem with getting rid of petrol cars (the whole country is aiming to be fossil fuel-free by 2050).Above all, there’s a belief that sustainability need not make the city poorer: that innovation and “green growth” can be lucrative in and of themselves. “In Copenhagen, green transformation goes hand-in-hand with job creation, a growing economy and a better quality of life,” says Jensen. “We have also shown that it’s possible to combine this transition with economic growth and market opportunities for businesses, and I think that other countries can learn from our example.”Besides, as Jensen notes, there is little alternative, and even less time: “National states have failed to take enough responsibility, but cities have the power and will to create concrete solutions. We need to start accelerating their implementation – we need to act now.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79ffdb0c133f6f816c6e2c95bbee63b72db8e6ff/0_73_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a759f1943f48c5271aca76a1dd0ab73","title":"election climate brexit green policies mp","story":"Having a few ‘green policies’ is no longer enough. Ask yourself: what will your next MP do to save the world?The government that wins the next election stands to govern for half of the decade that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says we have left to tackle the climate emergency. It will also oversee next year’s international conference on the climate crisis (COP 26) – the most important since the Paris Accord of 2015. We owe it to ourselves and to the world to make sure that climate is not a marginal issue at the election, whenever it comes.Yet maybe we don’t need to worry. We have largely enjoyed a broad “climate consensus” in this country: we believe in the science, most of us don’t indulge climate change deniers and there is agreement on the need to act. Not for us on this issue – at least so far – the culture wars of the US.But not so fast. There is a real danger that this sense of consensus creates complacency. Of course we should value the fact that both major parties agree on the need to tackle the emergency. We should be pleased that the target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 was passed without opposition in the House of Commons, and that the Climate Change Act of 2008 passed by a massive majority. We should not create isions where they do not exist – goodness knows we are a ided enough country as it is.Yet for all our relative progress as a country, no country, including us, is doing enough to meet the Paris goal, which commits us to efforts to keep warming to 1.5C or below, and no more than 2C. The UK is off track for our targets for the late 2020s and 2030s, and outside the power sector, progress has stalled. We are consumed by Brexit, when next year we will need to strain every sinew and use every resource at our disposal to get 190 countries to agree to toughen their targets so we can get closer to having a chance of meeting the Paris goals.Every party and every candidate should therefore be asked where they stand on the key questions that face us – not just on warm words and good intentions but on the actions they are willing to take and support. What is your vision for tackling the climate emergency? Are you willing to be consistent in the decisions you take so climate is not simply an add-on? Are you willing to commit to the urgency required?On vision, it is obvious to me – and I believe to the Labour party – where we need to go. As I have written before, avoiding the nightmare only takes us so far. We need to spell out the dream, encapsulated in the phrase the Green New Deal – so we meet concerns about economic justice and the climate emergency together. That’s about creating millions of jobs as we change the way we power our country, heat our homes and travel around. We also need to redesign our towns and cities and rethink the way we use our land, improving quality of life as we do. Every party should be tested on its plan to meet this vision, or an alternative, and how they will pay for it in a way that is fair.Next comes the need for consistency of purpose and singularity of focus on this issue. It is no longer enough to have some “green policies”. In a world where we move to zero carbon, every policy must be green. Of course there is a transition, and the transition must be fair for the workers affected, but there must be a framework that doesn’t simply ignore the problem. For instance, going ahead with the third runway at Heathrow without any sense of how that is consistent with this framework will undermine the public’s trust that we are serious.Finally, there is the issue of urgency. Labour’s conference decision to aim for net zero by 2030 is controversial. With today’s politics and the challenges of transition we face, it feels like a moonshot. But Apollo-level ambition, imagination and determination is exactly what we need.There is reason to hope that we can achieve more than looks possible at present. Climate “tipping points” are generally about uncontrollable negative feedback loops. But there are positive tipping points, too. We have seen this with the costs of solar and wind tumbling far faster than anyone forecast, driving much higher take-up than anyone expected. After initial support by government, these technologies now make an unanswerable economic case on their own merits.Whatever the level of reductions by 2030 to which different parties commit, we need a totally different level of commitment by government not for 2050 but for the next decade. It is now five months since parliament passed the climate emergency motion, and apart from the net zero target for 30 years’ time, government has done nothing to show it gets what an emergency means.If an election comes soon, Brexit will be the dominant issue. But the climate emergency matters even more to the long-term future of the country. That future depends on decisions made in the next five years. Consensus on the need to act matters. But to save the planet, we need an arms race on speed, scale and urgency.• Ed Miliband is MP for Doncaster North and a former climate change secretary"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc8d54888bc86644eb0e52e41e85467cd231f42f/0_232_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=355a1b2ef883097b6afaa0e11de5fc05","title":"greta abiy ahmed nobel peace prize","story":"Huge congratulations to the prime minister of Ethiopia, who has just been awarded the Nobel peace prize in Oslo, beating out competition from hotly fancied regional candidate Greta Thunberg. Abiy Ahmed was garlanded for his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation, and for bringing an end to more than 20 years of conflict between Ethiopia and its neighbouring Eritrea. So yes, this is a victory.But in a very real sense, far more deeply felt in the content mills of the west, it is also a tragedy. Clearly, Abiy’s win and Greta’s loss leaves countless angry hacks, pundits, shockjocks, populists, provocateurs and alt-right conspiracists with an unexpected hole in their rant schedule. The crusaders had their already somewhat familiar backlashes against this 16-year-old climate activist all ready to go, and then this absolute dog in the manger goes and ruins it for them. How dare he?! That is the most urgent question we face today.For those guys – and they are mostly guys, for whatever reason – I have good news. I’m here to assist! I know the one type of recycling you really commit to is content recycling. Specifically, your own. Some of you are so committed to this lifestyle that you have not actually availed yourself of any new content in years – so why should this occasion be any different? Why not slightly repurpose your anti-Greta rants to suit the person who did end up winning? Simply take your exact same Greta attack lines, and substitute “him” and “his” for “she” and “her”. Honestly, you’ll see how easily your rabid criticisms of Greta can be applied to Abiy – or, indeed, to anyone else, from anywhere, who actually cares about anything, and tries to do something about it. What follows will show you just how interchangeable your theory-of-everything arguments are. And I hope you’ll be grateful for the fact I’ve included a leeetle pushback against each one, just to keep you sharp.“Like Greta, Abiy’s voice is weird.” Yes, he has an Ethiopian accent. But listen: try not to be overly triggered by people who speak differently to you. If it helps, imagine Greta and Abiy are a pair of European football managers who – if they finally wearied of humouring your imbecilic questions – could actually insult members of your trade in at least four languages.“Like Greta, Abiy can be publicly emotional.” Definitely. In June he was seen weeping at a memorial to an assassinated general. I think people generally prefer the cold, hard logic you scream into the camera on your conspiracy-zine cable show.“Like Greta, Abiy goes about things the wrong way.” I feel sure you’re on to something here – Abiy’s brand of politics has been credited for its informality, energy and charisma, and you could definitely pick holes in that. One east African political expert said of Abiy’s rapid achievements in a single year: “For Ethiopia, a country where everything has been done in a very prescriptive, slow and managed way, these changes are unprecedented.” As you have done with Greta, I know you’ll find a way of tutting that there are established ways of doing things, and those who don’t adhere to them should be treated with suspicion and barely masked fear.“Like Greta, Abiy seems to have a pretty high opinion of himself.” I know, right? People have said this about Abiy. And I know I’ve heard it about Greta. In fact, I think I heard it on TV, from you, one of those times you went all the way out to the Sky TV studios at half past eleven at night to do the paper review to build your media brand.“Like Greta, Abiy does not speak for working-class people.” This one’s always worth a punt, so wheel it out again. But to clarify, I assume we’re talking about working-class people where you are honking this particular observation, typically a broadcast studio in London? It’s possible you need to get out a little more – and most particularly, out of broadcast studios. For now, let me bring you up to speed: working-class people in Ethiopia really did care about Abiy’s cause, just as working-class people in, say, the Philippines, definitely care about Greta’s cause, because they’re going to drown before you do. This is how we know there’s no climate justice in the world.“Like Greta, Abiy just picked a right-on cause.” Well, quite – and the last thing you should do is wonder why it was right-on. Instead, try to get 10 minutes of talk radio out of explaining why caring about Ethiopia is very Bob Geldof. If anyone can, you can.“Like Greta, is it possible Abiy is being influenced by his parents?” Both of Abiy’s parents are dead, but this is still an important point: it’s definitely possible they have had an influence on his life. Many people have parents who are or were interested in the things they are interested in, who wished them success, and basically agreed with them on several subjects. Parsing your entire output, I’m guessing you don’t. Are these two things maybe connected? I know you value saying the unsayable above all, so in that spirit you’d support me asking: is it possible your parents openly dislike you? Or maybe secretly do?“Like Greta, shouldn’t Abiy be in school?” Not really. I’m afraid the Ethiopian prime minister is 43, so this is the one point I think you’re going to struggle to upcycle. Still, I’m sure you could imply heavily that he has an awful lot to learn. We all have – and seemingly from you. As long as asking why someone isn’t in school counts as you being in work, the entire planet should simply thank you for your service."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d78961f8d86e92a13aeb182857491e95332ae53b/705_257_2290_1374/master/2290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16c764d2bebd5cec65e2757ad4143be1","title":"the guardian view on the polluters days of reckoning","story":"The huge differences in the voting records of MPs on climate issues, revealed in the ’s rankings today, should immediately disabuse anyone of the notion that Britain’s elected politicians are united – apart from a handful of contrarians – in their efforts to limit global heating.True, a consensus exists in the UK and most of Europe with regard to the necessity of cutting emissions. That is in stark contrast to countries such as the US and Australia, where leading politicians deny climate science and promote fossil fuel extraction. But acceptance of the evidence that shows the next decade will be crucial for efforts to restrict global temperature rises to 1.5C is the basis for action, not a substitute for it. Politicians should be judged on what they do. And our research shows that the voting record of most Conservative MPs over the past decade, on 16 parliamentary isions ranging from fracking to renewable energy subsidies and vehicle emissions, is abysmal. They are five times more likely to vote against climate measures than MPs from other parties, with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, among several dozen MPs to get the lowest possible score of zero.Conservatives are also far more likely than MPs from other parties to have accepted salaries, donations trips or gifts from oil companies, petrostates, airports or supporters of climate contrarian thinktanks. Between 2008 and 2018, for example, 32 Conservative MPs accepted free trips to Saudi Arabia, along with eight MPs from other parties. The industry minister, Nadhim Zahawi, received more than £1m from fossil fuel companies – all of it declared and legitimate – and is one of several current and former ministers to have been paid second salaries by oil companies, or firms with substantial interests in the industry. A total of £5m in such payments was declared by MPs over 10 years. is not suggesting MPs were paid for their votes, which is illegal. Our research forms part of a special investigation, The polluters, which has explored the contribution of major carbon-emitting businesses to the climate emergency. The point is to highlight the way these firms have sought to shape public opinion and regulatory structures both through direct lobbying and less directly, such as through funding thinktanks or groups active on social media.Environmental campaigners in the US, UK and elsewhere have worked for years to highlight the enormous power wielded by giant oil and gas companies – and to show how this power has been used to advance their political and economic interests, particularly via the colossal sums pumped into US elections. In the late 1990s, American oil interests embarked on a global campaign to undermine climate science and shift public opinion – a campaign that had much in common with that waged in the 1960s by tobacco companies, aimed at undermining the research revealing the dangers of smoking.Public discussion of the climate emergency, including in the media, is often focused on inidual consumer choices, such as whether to give up meat, on national governmental decisions, in setting laws and targets, or on the all-important transnational efforts governed by the UN’s framework convention on climate change. All these approaches to our increasingly dangerous global situation are valid and important.It is difficult to confront the full implications of irresponsibility on such a monumental scale. But we, and our politicians, now have no choice but to try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90eb0e77ed2cb22b92ecf222d2802883c2d1a800/0_87_1003_602/master/1003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34a765ca7bf0436539448085d91278f6","title":"cocktails culture and craft beer a locals guide to canadas halifax and neighbouring regions","story":"The secret is out. Halifax and its surrounds are a laidback, coastal paradise where postcard perfect seaside towns and vibrant nightlife make for a good time, recommends local Jaime JacquesFoodies take note, a culinary boom is happening in Halifax right now, and the land is linked to everything. Visitors can expect to find ciders made with robust heritage apples, beers infused with locally grown blueberries, and of course, seafood everywhere, including some of the best lobsters to be found on the North American Atlantic coastline. The city is home to seven universities, and it’s got the youthful spirit to prove it. Breweries, cafes, live music and general levity can be found around every corner. Here are a few neighbourhoods and nearby regions that visitors shouldn’t miss to get a true taste of Canada’s most playful port city, a destination that’s only a six-hour flight from the UK.One of the city’s oldest neighbourhoods, the North End has been revived and transformed of late. The streets are an eclectic mix of colourful saltbox houses, old industrial warehouses and hip restaurants serving up craft beer, local wines and creative fare.For a casual afternoon pint in the summer, there’s nowhere better than the patio at Good Robot Brewing Company, where there is a rotating cast of all-star brews on the go and the vibe is always friendly and fun. The small but funky 2 Crows Brewing Co also has 12 taps and a brand new reveal every Saturday. Bar manager Mitch Gilbert recommends the Pollyanna Wild Northeast IPA, a juicy, tropical, bitter IPA that’s been flying off the shelves.“We propagate and grow our own yeast grains,” says Gilbert. “Then we add fruits sourced from Nova Scotia and malt from neighbouring Prince Edward Island. The results yield a quite extensive selection of barrel-aged beers.”For an unforgettable brunch, check out Edna, the bright and airy neighbourhood favourite, full of foraged wildflowers, a wide selection of beers and ciders, and some of the city’s best steaks, burgers and seafood. Later in the day, visit Field Guide – it’s just across the way and the perfect place to start off an evening. Try exquisitely crafted cocktails while enjoying the sharing menu that changes according to season.Popular with visitors and locals alike, Bar Kismet will complete your visit to Halifax, but you’ll need to book ahead or queue.

Award-winning bartender Cooper Tarel recommends the signature cocktail, Return of the Sumac, paired with the popular appetiser ahi tartare and allumettes fries.Finally, the hidden gem Water and Bone offers up rotating taps of all-local ciders and beers, excellent happy-hour specials, a sweet back patio and insanely popular noodle bowls (with house-made noodles).Citadel Hill strategically overlooks Halifax harbour and is what enticed the British military here in 1749. It’s worth a visit, and not only for the view from the top. From there, head downtown, stopping for a stroll in the Public Gardens. Don’t miss the amazing Halifax Central Library, a cultural hub with award-winning architecture and two excellent cafes inside.Head to Argyle Street for a bite or a pint or two after a day of exploring the city. The strip is one of Halifax’s nightlife hubs, where patios line both sides of the pedestrian-only zone. East of Grafton has a lovely little outdoor terrace that’s popular for lunch and alfresco dinner in the warmer months. Farther down, the elegant Lot Six stands out when it comes to local seafood dishes and cocktails, while The Five Fishermen offers up inspired seafood with an upscale casual atmosphere.For traditional east-coast nightlife, try Durty Nelly’s, while the Carleton is a must for live music in a cosy, friendly atmosphere.On the waterfront, a favourite place for a dinner date is The Bicycle Thief. Think incredible house-made pasta tossed with melt in your mouth scallops, sublime red wine and candlelit tables right beside the water. For afternoon pints by the water check out the Stubborn Goat Beer Garden where, as they say, beer tastes better by the ocean.Once at the Halifax waterfront, it’s easy to catch the ferry across the harbour to downtown Dartmouth, which is developing its own hip little collection of bars and restaurants. Heading up the local favourites is the wildly popular Canteen, conveniently located only steps away from the ferry terminal. There’s also the casual Battery Park, offering a slew of craft beers and home to Ace Burger Co, voted the best burgers in Halifax for several years running. For coffee, hit up Two If By Sea, the bright and friendly neighbourhood cafe that’s next door.Visitors to Halifax should also consider a trip to Nova Scotia’s wine country – it’s just an hour from the city. Leading the way is Lightfoot \u0026amp Wolfville Vineyards, a biodynamic, organic winery with strong Acadian roots. Owner Rachel Lightfoot’s family has been farming in the valley for eight generations, creating German-style wines including riesling and pinot noir.“For us, being in tune with the land means being constantly connected to the past and future generations,” she says. Lightfoot recommends trying their bestseller, the Terroir Series Scheurebe. “Nova Scotia’s ocean-influenced cool climate provides freshness and energy, melding with the inherent aromatic intensity of the scheurebe grape to create a truly unique wine,” she says.Another notable favourite is Luckett Vineyards. Pete Luckett is a transplanted Brit who emigrated to Nova Scotia and became a local celebrity. The restaurant is highly recommended, especially the charcuterie board. For beer lovers, Church Brewing Company offers an exceptional collection of craft beers and ciders and locally sourced hearty meals.The area surrounding Tatamagouche boasts several beaches, and because the Trans Canada Trail runs through it, visitors can walk, bike or run their way through town. The village, just under two hours from Halifax by car, is also home to the popular Tatamagouche Brewing Co. The brewery is inside the former village library, bought and reinvented by local craft beer enthusiast Christiane Jost.“The great thing about the beer scene here is that breweries are in every corner of this province,” she says. “We offer world-class beer with unique twists, using local ingredients.”Jost also recommends local restaurants Train Station Inn and the North Shore Diner. “They are both open seasonally, and create fresh food that showcases our local produce,” she says.The idyllic seaside villages of Mahone Bay, Peggy’s Cove, Chester and Old Town Lunenburg, a Unesco world heritage site, make up the south shore, and a scenic coastal drive to visit all four is one of the highlights of a visit to the region. For a self-guided tour, rent a car and enjoy the drive at your leisure, exploring the colourful seaside towns along the way. The area is peppered with local cafes, galleries and boutique shops, perfect for random stops. Over the years, there has also been a surge of creative cuisine along the route, focusing on fresh seafood, seasonal greens and berries, and of course, ciders and beer.Try starting out at The Barn in Mahone Bay or No9 Coffee Bar in Lunenburg for excellent food, coffee and ambience. For something more substantial, check out Grand Banker Bar and Grill for the famous Lunenburger, six ounces of local ground beef, topped with smoked mozzarella and bacon, spinach, Nova Scotia lobster and a bacon-wrapped scallop.

Housing about 50 species of live tropical bugs to view and experience, the zoo’s friendly and knowledgeable tour guides will have even insectophobes seeing these creepy but fascinating critters in a new light.Speaking of insects, there are sure to be many hanging out at Butchart Gardens. In 1912, Jennie Butchart began transforming the former limestone quarry that made up her back yard into a beautiful sunken garden – and things escalated. Today, the gardens are a national historic site,  more than 22 hectares and showcase more than 900 types of plant, as well as a carousel, night illuminations, boat tours, firework displays, and an outdoor ice-skating rink in the winter. Whatever the season, this is one attraction worth adding to the itinerary. If you’re in the mood to take in one of the finest views in Victoria, then head to Mount Douglas Park lookout, which offers panoramic views of greater Victoria to the north and west, the Haro Strait to the east and downtown Victoria to the south.Rainy day, or just fancy resting your feet after a long day sightseeing?

One visit and you’ll see why it’s a Victoria locals’ favourite.For caffeine connoisseurs, Discovery Coffee cafe and roastery is a must-visit. With roasting happening daily on-site, brew methods chosen depending on the type of bean, and fresh handmade doughnuts prepared in-house every morning, it’s hardly surprising Discovery now has five locations in the Victoria area.Venture a little farther afield (a 30-minute drive or one-hour bus journey from central Victoria) and you’ll find an idyllic spot for a drink, courtesy of the Sea Cider Farm \u0026amp Ciderhouse, a family owned orchard and ciderhouse that is well worth the trip.

Spanning only a few blocks, the streets lined with outdoor fruit markets, musicians and local craft boutiques are emblematic of Toronto’s erse spirit.From Mexican to Japanese food, the market is a culinary beast. It’s home to Toronto’s best-rated taco shop, Seven Lives, where you can snatch a spot in line and grab a combo of three fish, octopus or shrimp tacos for less than £10.

While most of this guide features hotspots in the west end, the sweeping views of the skyline and flourishing culinary scene puts this east end spot on the map.Toronto’s appetite for brunch is huge – and its menus reflect the city’s status as one of the most erse in the world, fusing cultures, ingredients and techniques from across the globe. Leslieville knows its way around a brunch better than pretty much anywhere else in Toronto.

But it is a tool for voters to question whether their MPs are representing their climate concerns.The votes and a list of relevant interests were chosen by the  and DeSmog, in consultation with other experts, who also determined whether votes were pro-climate or not. Full methodology here.Despite parliament’s support for ever greater long-term emissions-cutting goals, politicians have consistently shot down practical short-term measures. There have been occasional rebellions against the party whip – most dramatically during the 2018 Heathrow expansion vote. But nothing on the scale of Brexit, suggesting most MPs consider the climate a lesser priority. Analysis: The approach used has certain limitations. Earlier this year parliament endorsed the Conservative administration’s proposal to make the UK carbon neutral by 2050 and also approved a Labour party motion to declare a climate emergency. However, because these votes were passed by general assent, no voting record is available for either and they could not be incorporated into the scores.Votes: The 16 votes chosen for the analysis took place between 28 October 2008 (the third reading of the climate change bill) and 3 July 2019 (Heathrow north-west runway). MPs must have voted at least three times to receive a score.Graphic: When multiple MPs have the same score their respective dots stack up vertically on the graph.

So who should tackle Danielle Lloyd?Go home Kramer vs Kramer. Bog off FrostNixon. You want drama? You want glamour? You want the sheer white-knuckle thrill of watching one woman block her Instagram followers one by one? Then there’s only one thing for it? The Coleen RooneyRebekah Vardy Wag Wars film.And it will. Sure, no script exists yet, and no director is attached. But in a press junket for her new film yesterday, Keira Knightley has thrown her hat into the ring for the role of Coleen Rooney.OK, that’s a slight exaggeration. What actually happened was that, in attempting to keep up with the 500mph enthusiasm of a Heat reporter’s recollection of the story, Knightley appeared to agree with the suggestion that she should play Coleen Rooney in a film. That is already enough.Keira Knightley would be a perfect Coleen Rooney. Look me in the eye and tell me that you wouldn’t pay to see one of our finest actors, burnished in the pedigree of a million period pieces, slathered in Ronseal with a nylon wig Velcroed to her head. Tell me you wouldn’t watch an epic psychodrama where she plays a woman trapped in a vast McMansion with only her four children for company, watching her self-esteem erode as her husband plays away, before finally discovering her talent as a private investigator. Of course you would. I’d watch Keira Knightley in anything, but I promise that I would watch the absolute crap out of her in this.The idea of Wag Wars film immediately sounds like a low-rent, trashy, Footballers’ Wives-type production. But Knightley’s commitment changes everything. Now this is a prestige picture, and it deserves the highest calibre of acting talent. Here’s how I suggest casting the rest of the film.Coleen’s arch enemy. Older than Rooney but newer to the wag game, Vardy undergoes a downfall that is nothing less than operatic. We need an actor with the range to flit between victim and antagonist at a moment’s notice, who can lash out with theatrical abandon at everyone and everything as the walls cave in around her. We need someone whose beauty is cut through with a thick streak of psychic darkness. In short, we need Rachel Weisz.Low and grunting, Wayne Rooney should have been Coleen’s rock throughout this scandal. But his refusal to even so much as like her tweet demonstrates a man who is surly and aloof, an old-fashioned man’s man. We need an actor who can at once epitomise the latent anger that goes into posting a tweet such as “I’ll put u asleep within 10 seconds u little girl. Don’t say stuff and not follow up on it. I’ll be waiting” and the stupidity to then send that tweet to himself. As such, I recommend Benedict Cumberbatch.Cut Jamie Vardy open and you’ll find the phrase “Chat shit get banged” written through him like a stick of Brighton rock. A wiry athlete who seems to be a nanosecond away from headbutting someone to death, Vardy will need to be played by an actor who can inhabit both a roiling hostility and a naive marital devotion that will soon be tested to its limit. Jamie Vardy should be played by Eddie Redmayne.Just as the tremors from Rooney’s tweet were starting to die down, who should pop up uninvited but Danielle Lloyd, a seasoned establishment wag. Danielle Lloyd is a key role here, for she will come to represent the swell of ill feeling for Rebekah Vardy in the wag community. She is this film’s Greek chorus, passing violently disdainful comment from afar. She also has an OnlyFans page. She should therefore be played by Tilda Swinton.The end of this film will come when Victoria Beckham, grande dame of wags, decides enough is enough. She gathers together Rooney and Vardy and haughtily reminds them that wags symbolise something greater than themselves. She tells them of their higher moral purpose. Through sheer power of personality, she brokers an uneasy truce ready to be shattered in the sequel. There is no better Victoria Beckham than Joan Collins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3574f8ae4452a5cf37065d226949a872a1e1978d/37_7_730_438/master/730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1a470972134cd7bda32f4500616d4c7","title":"suzi q review suzi quatro documentary","story":"Musicians from Debbie Harry to Joan Jett salute the trailblazing bassist in a chronicle that stays just the right side of fawningThis is a fan-servicing but not necessarily hagiographic documentary from Australian director Liam Firmager, which recounts the life and career of rocker Suzi Quatro. All the usual stations of the rock-doc biopic cross get a stop-off here, from the humble origins (in the suburbs of Detroit), the slog up the success ladder, collision with the big time, and then the decline, comeback and Hall of Fame phase, often capped by the release of a documentary exactly like this.Quatro’s story differs from the mean simply because she was one of the very few hard-rocking women in the business in the 70s she was a mere slip of girl when she hit the big time, barely taller than the bass she played. To the film’s credit, obeisance is paid to the female artists who came before and those who were around at the same time these include Quatro’s sister, Patti, who Suzi played with in the beat combo the Pleasure Seekers before Suzi went solo and Patti formed the now-cult band Fanny.The middle section offers a clear-eyed consideration as to why Suzi never really became a headliner in America despite her success in the UK and assorted Eurovision nations, and further afield in Australia and Japan, where her singles regularly went to No 1. And there’s no shortage of tributes from Quatro’s many famous admirers, including Debbie Harry, Tina Weymouth and Chris Franz from the Talking Heads, and no fewer than three of the Runaways – Joan Jett, Cherie Curie and Lita Ford.A thick impasto of archive material (often annoyingly shown via an on-screen TV set), including the phase when she appeared on Happy Days, fills in the gaps between reminiscences from not just friends and acquaintances but the principals themselves, such as Quatro’s family, and closest collaborators. And of course, interviewed throughout is the woman herself, now pushing 70 and still full of spit and vinegar but also the capacity to laugh at her younger self.• Suzi Q is released in the UK on 11 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f23c0d5aeecada31f6cc5f3d30e5ff8b48395c1/104_248_6474_3884/master/6474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d7fd7fb1cf0dbe2bda450382011de3c","title":"simon martin mana chef manchester first michelin star 40 years","story":"The 29-year-old rejects complaints city has been overlooked and says his approach is to keep it simpleSome have called it a curse, some labelled it a snub – however you described it, Manchester’s 40-year pursuit of a Michelin star finally ended this week. The city’s first entry into the red book since 1977 came via Mana, which opened less than a year ago under its chef-patron, Simon Martin.Foodies eager to sample what Michelin inspectors describe as “exciting modern dishes with Nordic influences” will have to wait though – the restaurant is fully booked for the first three months of 2020. Mana has just nine tables, each with its own pendant lighting configuration, surrounded by huge glass windows and an open kitchen ided into sections by temperature.On Wednesday morning, the team were busy painstakingly preparing the 15-18 dishes that would be served to that night’s 25 lucky guests who had booked before Monday’s Michelin announcement.Although still reeling from the news, Warrington-born Martin, 29, is determined not to let the star become a distraction, and vowed to keep cooking for his guests, who he says are “the most important people in this building”. The minute you “start cooking for a guidebook, instead of customers, that’s it,” he says. Martin scoffs at the idea that Michelin had unfairly overlooked Manchester in the past: “I’ve always said it’s ridiculous if anybody says there’s something against the city, that’s not how it works. It’s just … they hadn’t found a restaurant that meets their standards up until this point.”Martin trained at Noma in 2016, before returning after two years to Manchester to be with his girlfriend, a nurse at a local hospital. He draws his influences widely, praising the focus he observed in Gordon Ramsay’s kitchen and saying he visited Japan earlier in the year on a fact-finding mission, but he says working under Noma’s René Redzepi made him “look at food very differently”. He wants to set the record straight about reports of him being homeless while training in Copenhagen though: “Look, I wasn’t smoking spice on the street.” He says he was offered a job on the last day of a three-month unpaid internship but hadn’t made any accommodation arrangements.“It’s hard to find a place to live and I didn’t really want to say to them that I couldn’t start straight away.” So he slept on the streets after shifts for a few weeks in late summer, but is at pains to point out that he showered at Noma and was very well fed.What does Mana’s success mean for the city’s food scene? The Mancunian food critic Louise Rhind-Tutt has high hopes. “A star attracts footfall, tourism and investment, all vital to a city like Manchester, but it also shapes lives and careers,” she said.Thom Hetherington, the chief executive of Northern Restaurant and Bar, the annual Manchester-based trade show, agrees: “The star is a justified and deserved accolade for Mana, but in terms of what it does for Manchester, it’s about the profile and the audience that it will bring, who won’t just eat at Mana - it will have a greater impact on the city.”Martin is aiming for a second Michelin star in the future, but for the moment he’s happy to concentrate on branching into opening for lunches mid-week. He hopes the star will boost other local businesses, but is mainly excited that it will attract hard-to-find special produce. “Hopefully, suppliers will be contacting us now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c34af1a27ce7b6685b253aaef2144c849adc4f92/95_108_2106_1264/master/2106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fa974ac9bf8051066b3719b1298de1d","title":"czech republic england euro 2020 qualifier match report","story":"This was the night when England had wanted to secure their qualification to the Euro 2020 finals to fire the excitement ahead of what stands to be a home tournament, with so many of the ties next summer to be held at Wembley. A win against a game if functional Czech Republic team would have done it but, after following an error-strewn first-half performance with an improved second period, they switched off at the end to slip to a shock defeat.The Czech Republic substitute Zdenek Ondrasek was the home team’s matchwinner, running on to Lukas Masopust’s pass to finish as the visiting defence, not for the first time, were reduced to bystanders and England were left to contemplate a first qualification defeat since the loss to Ukraine in October 2009.A bizarre statistic had showed that England had not won in Prague since 1908 when Bohemia were the opponents and this was a setback for Southgate, given that everything his team does is viewed through the prism of how they might fare at the finals. Play like this and it will not end well.Once again, the defensive looseness was a major worry and although chances came and went in the second half, England had flirted with trouble for much of the evening and they would be undone at the last. The hard truth was that only Jordan Pickford, who made three good saves, and Harry Kane, who scored from the penalty spot, emerged with any credit.It had been possible to paint this as England’s toughest test of the group phase, even though the reverse fixture at Wembley finished in a comfortable 5-0 victory. The scoreline was flattering, Southgate had warned, and Czech Republic brought a sense of injustice to this occasion. They wanted to impose themselves, to show who they were, on a day when plenty of other things were going on in Prague – not least the state funeral of Karel Gott, the legendary singer.England struck first following a slick move that culminated in Raheem Sterling tearing clear up the inside left channel. Southgate had given a full debut to Mason Mount, a player he has liked since he saw him playing for the England Under-16s, and it was the midfielder, who started in an advanced central role in a 4-2-3-1 system, who got things going with a pass to Kane, whose first-time ball released Sterling.Masopust had given chase but, when Sterling cut back inside the area, the Czech winger was too heavy with his attentions, catching the legs of his opponent. Kane has missed two penalties for England nobody has ever missed three. But he got the job done with a clipped shot up the middle, having waited slightly for Tomas Vaclik to commit himself.From a position of strength, England allowed Czech Republic to recover and there were times during the first half when Southgate’s defenders appeared to be chasing shadows. It was no exaggeration to say that the Czechs dominated for long spells. They pressed high and quickly, and England were left to grope for a foothold.England’s defensive problems were writ large across the 5-3 win over Kosovo at St Mary’s last month and the inquest into the concession for 1-1 will not be pretty. There was a slip from Declan Rice in the centre, following Jakub Jankto’s corner, which allowed Ondrej Celustka to smuggle an effort towards goal and Jakub Brabec to touch home from close range. Michael Keane was the nearest England defender to Brabec and he was not close enough. The Czechs had won the corner after Pickford turned Celustka’s drive around the post.It was a soft goal to concede and not the only time that England looked vulnerable when trying to defend corners. Patrik Schick almost got on to the end of one in the 17th minute but the angle was against his ing header.England pieced together just one move of high quality in the first half, when most of the forward-thinking players were involved. Kane played the final pass to Mount and he was stopped by Celustka’s tackle. With Mount pressed high, often up alongside Kane, there was plenty of responsibility on Jordan Henderson and Rice but they struggled, at times, to get England playing, with Henderson guilty of a series of loose passes. The Czechs frequently out-numbered _England in midfield. The balance looked wrong for Southgate.The manager responded at the start of the second-half, reverting to a more familiar 4-3-3 formation, with Mount pulled back to a role on the left of midfield. The onus was on England to raise the tempo and they were more comfortable in their rejigged shape.The chances came, with Kane the architect of a gilt-edged one for Sterling. Kane’s sharp and incisive passing was a plus point of the performance. Sterling was one-on-one with Vaclik but he could not get the better of him. Kane also played in Jadon Sancho with a weighted ball over the top only for the winger to lack conviction, while Kane could be angry at himself when he failed to apply a decisive touch with the outside of his boot to a Sterling cross.Pickford made second-half saves to deny Masopust and Alex Kral – the first an excellent tip over the crossbar – and it was England who pressed and looked the likelier scorers. Kane could not beat Vaclik following a pass from the substitute Ross Barkley, but Ondrasek would fashion the sting in the tail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45efdf19f409c4b3b1c8e14858e1ca21c5392913/0_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cca800270c1f7a1a5864932e5f2eb1aa","title":"impressive and moving football schoolguardian young sportswriters of the year revealed","story":"Eight-year-old Caleb Waterhouse and Billy Taylor, 12, are our inaugural winners A fact-filled profile of the snowboard champion Katie Ormerod and a thrilling basketball match report have been revealed as the winners of the inaugural  and Football School Young Sportswriters of the Year award.The winner of the category for writers aged seven to nine, eight-year-old Caleb Waterhouse, wrote about Ormerod, who attended his primary school in West Yorkshire. In the category for ages 10 to 12, Billy Taylor, 12, wrote about the time he saw an NBA game in Los Angeles.Hundreds of students entered the competition, whose judges included the  columnist and former England footballer Eni Aluko and the World Cup-winning footballer Per Mertesacker.“Caleb wrote a moving article that shows he’s learnt a valuable lesson from Katie to stay active and positive, even in disappointing situations,” Aluko said. “The standard was so impressive, it was a hard to choose a winner,” Mertesacker added. “It was a pleasure to read these pieces!”The competition asked entrants to write either a match report of a sporting event, or a profile of an athlete of their choice, at a maximum of 600 words.Football was the most popular sport covered. The most popular inidual athletes profiled were Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappé and Raheem Sterling. In the older category, those who wrote about Sterling all mentioned his work in tackling racism and challenging the media to change their message around young black players. Our entrants saw him as a role model and an exciting voice for their generation. Other writers praised Mo Salah and James McClean for using their platform to make a stand for their beliefs.Some of the young writers explored their interest in coaching and management with fascinating explanations of the tactics and leadership skills of Wally Downes (AFC Wimbledon) and Marcelo Bielsa (Leeds United). Match reports were not limited to Champions League or Premier League level, with plenty covering Football League, non-league and school matches.The emotional engagement and memories that sport creates were captured in moving articles describing matches with family members who later died. One nine-year-old writer, a runner-up in the younger age group, paid tribute to Leicester City’s owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who died after his helicopter crashed outside the club’s King Power Stadium last October. The judges thought he wrote with impressive maturity and empathy.Some of the best entrants sought a personal connection with their subjects: the mascot who held hands with Davinson Sánchez before Spurs played Fulham and the Everton fan who met André Gomes and couldn’t forget how lovely he smelled. Another author complained that his dad’s half-time Bovril stank (food and drink, many of the writers taught us, are a critical part of the sport-going experience).The second most popular sport was athletics, closely followed by gymnastics. Even after their retirement, Jessica Ennis-Hill and Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson remain inspiring figures, while Dina Asher-Smith, Max Whitlock and Claudia Fragapane featured. The entries ned sport’s broad spectrum and included Gaelic football, synchronised swimming, equestrian, ski jumping and darts.Women’s sport featured highly among our entrants, with Lucy Bronze and Alex Scott the most popular footballers. American sports also proved popular, with more entries on basketball and wrestling than cricket and tennis.There were some outstanding turns of phrase that impressed the judges. We enjoyed descriptions of Liverpool’s full-back Andy Robertson as “the salt in the crisps, if it’s not there it’s not very good”, and the non-league goalkeeper who was attacked by a French bulldog called Pie during a game.“We were blown away by the number of entrants, the different sports covered and the high standards that were set,” said the Football School author and judge Ben Lyttleton. “The enthusiasm and breadth of knowledge each writer showed in their articles was tremendous. There is no doubt that the future of sports writing is bright.”Marcus Christenson, football editor at the  and the Observer, said: “There was such a vibrancy and youthful exuberance in the writing, a confirmation if needed that children really are superb at expressing themselves when given a chance, especially if they are writing about their favourite subject.” and Football School Young Sportswriters of the Year award will be held again next year. Football School is a book series for seven-to-12-year-olds that opens up the curriculum through football. The latest in the series, Football School Season 4, is out now.

Thanks for your company - night!Here’s Gareth Southgate “Our performance wasn’t good enough – simple as that. The winning goal was typical of the chances we gave up throughout the night. We have to accept that there weren’t enough good performances. We tried to change the shape in the first half, which didn’t work as well as it might. We conceded too many chances and gave the ball away too often.”A reminder that there was some trouble before the game. I don’t envy the local bobbies on the late shift in Prague tonight.Harry Kane speaks “It was down to us. We had the perfect start but we were sloppy with the ball and they scored soon after. We weren’t fighting and pressing as much as we normally do. The second half was a bit better but we didn’t take a couple of chances to go ahead and unfortunately they scored at the end.“It’s a bit of a wake-up call. We’re still in a good position so there’s no need to panic. But we’ve still got stuff to work on, as you could see tonight. We gave the ball away too cheaply, especially in the first half.”Peep peep! England have lost a qualifying match for the first time in a decade. They were nowhere near their best, despite an improved second-half performance, and the Czech Republic were deserved winners. England were sloppy and sluggish, perhaps complacent, and they should have few complaints about the result. It was a bad night all teams have them. And it might be a timely reminder of a few immutable truths about winning football matches.90+1 min Four minutes of added time.90 min A final Czech Republic change: the excellent Lukas Masopust is replaced by Jaromir Zmrhal.89 min “I noticed the earlier debate over the goalie slot,” says Bill Hargreaves. “I think Pickford’s saves have removed the doubt.”I don’t know – they were reasonably straightforward. He’s a good, sometimes brilliant keeper, but I’m not sure I’ll ever completely trust him.What a story this is: Zdenek Ondrasek is 30 years old, playing in the MLS for FC Dallas, and now he has come off the bench to score on his international debut. Masopust moved into the area from the right and cut the ball back carefully for Ondrasek, who swept a low shot into the corner from 12 yards. That was a crisp first-time finish. Rose went down just before the goal after losing an aerial challenge with Soucek, but it wasn’t a foul. Soucek’s header found Masopust, and he and Ondrasek did the rest.84 min The substitute Ondrasek bursts to the edge of the area, only to slip over when he tries to come back onto his right foot.83 min This is England’s best spell of the game. A late winner would secure qualification for Euro 2020, although they have a fair safety net: three more group games and a play-off if necessary.82 min The Czech Republic make another change: Jakub Jankto is replaced by Jan Kopic.81 min: Vaclik saves from Kane! Barkley put Kane through on goal with a gloriously imaginative pass, curled around the defence from a deep position on the right wing, and Vaclik charged from his line to block Kane’s shot. Fine save.79 min Sterling has been England’s most consistent threat by a distance. Kane has flitted in and out of the match, though he has created England’s clearest chances with excellent through balls.78 min: Another good save from Pickford! That was lovely play from the Czech Republic. Kral played a one-two on the edge of the area with Darida, who improvised beautifully to chest the ball back into his path. Kral had two men free to his left but decided to belt the ball towards the near post from a tightish angle. Pickford moved smartly to his left to beat it around the post.76 min Now England appeal for a penalty when Sterling runs into Boril in the box. At most I think it was obstruction the referee waved play on.74 min Darida appeals unsuccessful for a penalty after a challenge from Rose. I don’t think there was much in it, though we haven’t seen a replay yet.73 min Sterling has moved to the right, with Rashford on the left.72 min England make a double substitution, with Marcus Rashford and Ross Barkley replacing Mason Mount and Jadon Sancho. Mount had a reasonable full debut, no more or less.70 min “Gomez should be given the nod over Keane,” says Ian Copestake, “because he is regularly on the shoulder of greatness.” 69 min Rose, who definitely has been booked, fouls Coufal. At first I thought he was in trouble, but replays showed it was just a collision.68 min I thought he was booked for that foul just before half-time, but apparently not. He should have been. He was certainly booked just then for dissent.68 min Sterling is apparently booked for dissent. Wasn’t he booked earlier?67 min “Come now, Niall Mullen,” says Geoff Wignall. “Sterling was booked for his play breaking foul - that’s hardly replicating his club form.”65 min The Czech Republic make a change, with the debutant Zdenek Ondrasek replacing Patrik Schick.64 min England are starting to create a few opportunities. Sterling floats a teasing cross from the left towards Kane, who misses with an attempted outside-of-the-boot flick.62 min More excellent play from Kane, who shields the ball with his back to goal before lofting a long pass over the defence towards Sancho. The ball doesn’t bounce kindly for him, however, and Brabec is able to clear on the edge of the area.60 min: Good save from Pickford! Masopust, cutting infield from the right, whips a big left-footed curler that is tipped over by the flying Pickford. It was a relatively comfortable save, as it was in the centre of the goal, but he still had to make it.57 min Kane, lurking on the left wing, plays a beautiful first-time pass to put Sterling through on goal. He tries to dance round the keeper Vaclik, who does well to get down to his right and push the ball away.54 min England have looked better since the tactical change - not least, as Glenn Hoddle points out on ITV, because Henderson has more scope to get ahead of the ball and impose himself on the game. He’s so much better in that role than as a deep-lying midfielder.52 min England don’t have too many attacking options among their 48 substitutes. Rashford, Abraham, Barkley and Alexander-Arnold are the only ones.51 min Soucek misses a half chance, slicing wide from 15 yards with his weaker left foot.49 min Sancho just underhits a through pass to Sterling, who made a fine run from left to centre and would have been clear with a slightly firmer pass.47 min It looks like England have switched to a familiar 4-1-2-3, with Mount pulled deeper and Henderson pushed forward. And why not?46 min Peep peep! England get the second half under way.“‘Sterling is booked for a play-breaking foul on Coufal,’” says Niall Mullen, quoting an earlier entry. “And they say England players don’t replicate their club performances for their country.”What’s your narrative here mate?Peep peep! The scoreline flatters England, who have been surprisingly wishy-washy. They took an early lead through Harry Kane’s penalty, but Jakub Brabec equalised from a corner four minutes later and since then the Czech Republic have been the better side.45+1 min England break from a Czech Republic corner. Henderson plays a superb long pass down the right ot Sancho, who runs at his man to win a corner. Mount’s corner comes to nothing.45 min “Surely at this stage,” says Matty Spillum, “the non-England eligible Liverpool player Gareth needs to call up is van Dijk?”I’d take Karius at the moment. 44 min Sterling is booked for a play-breaking foul on Coufal.41 min Masopust misses a good chance. Schick led a good Czech Republic break, moving elegantly away from Trippier and Henderson on the left. His cross skimmed off Darida and came to Masopust beyond the far post he controlled the ball and screwed a tame shot across goal. Actually, replays show the shot hit Rose, though I don’t think it was going in anyway.37 min England have lacked their usual menace on the counter-attack. Do you see what happens, Gareth, when you leave out Jesse Lingard?33 min Nice play from England. Sancho plays a subtle square pass to Kane on the edge of the area. He takes a touch and cracks a shot that is blocked, and Celustka gets to the loose ball just before Mount.32 min Schick’s header, from a right-wing free-kick, loops gently through to Pickford. It was another free header from a set-piece, though.29 min This has been a surprisingly poor performance from England, both with and without the ball. They’re nowhere near their best.26 min Trippier needs treatment after being caught late by Darida. Gareth Southgate takes the opportunity to call over a few of his team and politely ask them to stop playing silly buggers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4387bf40c1e8dede5726b8263b3bc6dd83cc4e46/1109_424_3973_2384/master/3973.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf2797dbb70ab68960e2560e07ae03e8","title":"football is forbidden how girls in a lebanon refugee camp kicked back","story":"After religious leaders tried to stop girls taking part in the sport, local coaches came up with an unlikely solutionA secret pitch where girls can play football away from the disapproving gaze of religious leaders and the rise of a top female football referee are among the unlikely success stories emerging from a refugee camp in north Lebanon.Under the aegis of a project to encourage learning through sport, Nahr el-Bared, a camp where thousands of Palestinian and Syrian refugees continue to live hand-to-mouth in dire conditions, has become the improbable setting for a minor cultural revolution.Change was set in motion after religious leaders in the community attempted to prevent girls from playing football and ban female coaches at an education centre supported by the global charity Right To Play.“One day, during Friday prayer, the religious people said: ‘We have female coaches in the camp, teaching people how to play football. We can’t allow this, it can’t happen. Girls cannot play football’. So they took away the players from our coaches and assigned a male coach instead,” says Sarah El Jizi, head coach in the Beirut area for Right To Play’s sports and humanitarian assistance project.“They were worried because the girls were wearing shorts – by shorts, I mean long shorts – and shirts with half sleeves. They were not comfortable with the girls wearing these uniforms and playing in front of everyone.”The unlikely solution was to build a wall. Or rather, build behind a wall. “There was a space at the back of an education centre,” explains El Jizi. “So Right To Play renovated it and built a football pitch for the female players to play without being seen by the community.“The female coaches kept on convincing the players and their parents to continue the training, and now they have more girls participating than before and can play freely.”Shielded from public view, the girls are cheered on from the sidelines by male family members and friends. There are also mixed games, used by the coaches to foster female leadership and a wider spirit of inclusion. In one such activity, called girls score, female team captains are nominated and tasked with choosing team-mates – and monopolising the scoresheet.“Only girls can score the goals,” explains Nimtaz-Tanya Noordin, Right To Play’s senior UK communications manager. “This puts girls at the heart of the team and gives them confidence. Importantly, it ensures boys pass the ball to the girls and see them as equal.“By involving boys… we are sowing the seeds of long-term social change to overcome the deep-rooted discrimination and attitudes that persistently disadvantage girls and women.”The battle is far from won. Girls may now able to play football in one sequestered corner of Nahr el-Bared, but women remain prohibited, their participation limited to occasional tournaments staged outside the camp by Right To Play.Slowly, though, attitudes are changing – not least among the girls themselves. “They are becoming more confident,” says El Jizi. “It’s changing their lives and how they interact with their neighbours, families, brothers, sisters.”It is also transforming their prospects. One girl, Latifa Kilani – “she is better than all the boys,” says El Jizi – now plays for the national under-16 women’s team. Another, Sanaa el Cheikh, has opened up her own football academy in Quobbeh, Tripoli, enabling her to support her brother and sister following the death of her parents. She was recently selected as a coach for Ansar Al Mawada Sports Club, a third ision men’s team in Tripoli – a rare precedent.Such achievements would once have been unthinkable for anyone from Nahr el-Bared. Twelve years ago, the camp was razed to the ground in a conflict between Lebanese security forces and Islamist militants. In the aftermath, the UN Relief and Works Agency declared it the scene of a “chronic humanitarian crisis”. The reconstruction effort that followed was the largest project ever mounted by the organisation.Although a funding shortfall of $66m (£54m) remains, significant progress has been made. Of the 27,000 residents forced to leave in 2007, the majority have returned to the camp. However, an estimated 7,137 people – 1,600 families – are still waiting. “The majority of these are renting private accommodation or living in temporary shelters, many of which are in extremely poor condition,” said a UN spokesman.El Jizi paints a bleak picture of life in the camp: “The refugees experience poverty and their electricity keeps cutting off they don’t have safe spaces and there is no access to public facilities.”Football pales into insignificance in such circumstances. But if day-to-day survival remains the imperative for many in Nahr el-Bared, Zeinab Halabi, from Lebanon, who started as a volunteer with Right To Play three years ago, is living proof of the shaping influence that sport can have on the fortunes of girls and women.“Without Right To Play I wouldn’t be where I am today,” says Halabi, 28, a former kickboxer who once claimed the title of strongest Arab woman in a weightlifting competition. “I take self-confidence from sport.”In a country where female football coaches are few and far between at any level, Halabi has managed Montada North Lebanon, a Lebanese Women’s Football League side, and is currently match commissioner for the men’s first ision, a role no woman has previously held. But it is her decision to orce her husband over his refusal to let her be involved in football that has given her a measure of fame.A kickboxer who became her coach and then her spouse, Halabi’s former husband asked her to turn her back on the game soon after they were married. “He asked me to stop, even though I had a girl’s team and not a men’s,” she recounts.“He said: ‘You have to stay in and wait for me to come home and cook and clean.’ So I told him: ‘I’m not a slave, I have my own world and you told me you respect that. I have my own life, and it’s about football. It’s your world and my world – we cannot stay together.’”The subsequent parting was acrimonious, with Halabi threatening to call the police on her husband when he turned up to a training session and became abusive. But she takes pride in her actions and has become a role model for young girls in Nahr el-Bared.“I always support the girls and tell them that they can do what I’m doing today,” says Halabi. “I tell them: ‘If you want to be like me – and you can be better than me – you have to do sport and, in time, you can find what you want.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0ea8a1bad7161746c194ebfd27fda1fe70b86ae/0_20_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89a67146ea2a3f957d633919676fceb3","title":"is screen time damaging for kids no study can tell you that oliver burkeman","story":"Adjusting your behaviour to each new wrinkle in the science is a mug’s gameIs too much screen time bad for your kids? Don’t look to this column for an answer. The truth is, nobody knows. The unceasing pendulum of lifestyle advice is currently swinging through a “debunking” phase, with numerous articles insisting it’s all been a big panic over nothing. But that’s partly because a report published earlier this year, by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said there wasn’t enough evidence to give firm guidelines to parents. As the paediatricians explained, though, the key problem is that sufficient high-quality research has yet to be conducted – a conclusion that somehow got turned into this headline, on the parenting website Motherly: “How harmful is screen time for kids? Not as bad as we may think”. The article was sponsored by the US mobile company Verizon – though science has yet to inform us if this was a matter of causation or merely correlation.Of course, there are valid research findings in this area: there’s evidence that excessive childhood TV time is correlated with obesity and poorer mental health, while social media use probably isn’t often a direct cause of teenage depression. And some studies are better designed than others. But neither opponents nor proponents of screen time have much incentive to mention a more unsettling fact – that it’s almost certainly impossible to know whether too much screen time would clearly damage your kids. The reasons aren’t surprising: human lives are extraordinarily complex things, and no study that aims to say anything meaningful about the population at large can do justice to the innumerable variables at work in your particular family.So maybe screen time is bad for your kids, but not as bad as the parenting they’d receive if you didn’t plonk them in front of a screen so you could get a quick nap? Or maybe it’s good, but less good than the alternatives. Some research suggests screen time has powerful educational benefits but obviously that depends not only on what your kids are watching, but on what they’d be doing with their time if they weren’t glued to the iPad. Maybe social media triggers depression in children only very rarely – but what if yours is that rare case? And on it goes.Researchers can control for some of these factors: for example, they try to ensure that when they detect a link between screen time and obesity, they’re not really just detecting effects of poverty. But you can’t control for each human life.None of which makes this kind of research utterly valueless as life advice it’s useful as general guidance for what’s likely to lead to good outcomes, all else being equal. But it does mean that anxiously attempting to implement such findings in your life, adjusting your behaviour to each new wrinkle in the science, is a mug’s game. In fact, in the case of parenting, it’s worse than that, because the anxiety you’ll broadcast in your efforts to follow the latest rules might prove just as detrimental to your children as if you’d failed to follow them.Perhaps we need more research into what happens when parents try too hard to obey parenting research. Maybe sometimes, to paraphrase Philip Larkin, they screw you up, as a direct result of attempting not to.In her 2004 book What Mothers Do (Especially When It Looks Like Nothing), Naomi Stadlen makes the case for not trying to follow other people’s parenting advice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a396f0e97486a6006c8b4dde9e6f0868ab1764a/0_113_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0820165d57f4a94b85d6bcd16413cd6","title":"harry styles lights up review soulful enigmatic return","story":"The former One Direction member’s second solo single is laced with surprises and sounds refreshingly like nothing his British male pop peers are doingHarry Styles is a Rorschach test – the antithesis of his pop peers who are very keen to set the terms of their own narrative and furiously reject what they perceive as incorrect interpretations of their work. He offers little information about his personal life, and seldom cares to address comments about his relationships and sexuality a recent cover profile in Rolling Stone provided a portrait of a boy at ease with fame, partial to Steely Dan and magic mushrooms, but not much in the way of hard detail.This laissez-faire approach is probably a reaction to spending his teenage years in One Direction, a band tightly controlled so as not to alienate potential consumers, though the upshot is much the same: he can be all things to all people. A sceptic could take it as a commercial strategy another might suggest that such an approach wouldn’t be available to female pop stars, who are generally held to more punishing standards. Either way, there is something quite soothing about his welcome-all-comers approach.Lights Up, his excellent comeback single – presumably the first from his forthcoming second album – is another open door. It largely leaves behind the 70s rock influences of his 2017 debut for more soulful territory, halfway between the rootedness of Michael Kiwanuka and the celestial airiness of Frank Ocean. It is laced with surprises – the looping, stilted pre-chorus cracks the easy mood, and even the sound of a gospel choir gets processed to an unnerving intensity – and sounds nothing like his blandly secular British male peers, or the narcotised synth-pop that’s dominated this year.As with his debut solo single, Sign of the Times (2017), Lights Up could easily straddle the Radio 1 and 2 playlists: the former thanks to his residual teen heartthrob status, the latter courtesy of the sophisticated production and conspicuous vintage elements. Meanwhile, the hardcore element of his fanbase have taken it as “proof” of Styles’s coming out as bisexual – his progressive attitude to sexuality (other people’s – he has never elucidated his own) and gender-fluid dress sense have seen him adopted as a queer ally. He sings about wondering who he is, coming into the light and refusing to go back the song was released on National Coming Out Day, and the unequivocally sexy video features a shirtless, sweaty Styles being grasped at by dancers of all genders.Who knows if they’re right – Styles’s ability to imply intimacy while remaining beguilingly vague is his defining pop trait. The verses of Lights Up could find him and a former partner talking at cross-purposes around the void of a relationship, or they could be a conflicted inner monologue the personal revelation he unearths in the chorus is as blinding as it is oblique: “Step into the light … I’m not ever going back.” While Styles is unlikely to offer up the results of self-actualisation publicly, his unlikely post-boyband evolution remains captivating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc2165a3c2b6242f6a9793e918d92967755bc85c/0_0_6182_4121/master/6182.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b72677313c585d5517a42e6e1c4a2368 1760w","title":"government signs up ferry firms for 87m in case of no deal brexit","story":"Four companies agree contracts that will help ensure supply of vital medicinesThe government has signed contracts worth almost £87m with four ferry companies to help ensure the supply of vital medicines in the event that the UK leaves the EU without a deal.The Department for Transport (DfT) said Brittany Ferries, DFDS, P\u0026ampO and Stena Line would be ready to deliver capacity equivalent to thousands of heavy goods vehicles a week from the 31 October Brexit deadline. The four firms will operate on 13 routes from eight UK ports that are less likely to face disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit: Teesport, Hull, Killingholme, Felixstowe, Harwich, Tilbury, Portsmouth and Poole.The six-month contracts are worth as much as £86.6m to the ferry operators. If the extra capacity is not needed, including under a negotiated Brexit deal, the government will pay the companies up to £11.5m in termination fees.Before the previous Brexit deadline of 29 March the government signed deals worth £89m with Brittany and DFDS to secure ferry space in the case of no deal. Cancelling those contracts cost £43.8m plus other costs that took the bill to more than £50m.Under the previous transport secretary Chris Grayling the government also scrapped a £14m contract with a company after it emerged it had no ferries.The much lower termination fees raise further questions about the original deal signed by the government. The DfT said it had minimised the potential costs of cancellation this time through a competitive bidding process.Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: “The UK is getting ready to leave the EU on the 31 October and, like any sensible government, we are preparing for all outcomes.“Our decisive action means freight operators will be ready and waiting to transport vital medicines into the country from the moment we leave.”The prospect of leaving the EU without an agreement has raised fears about shortages of vital medicines. The government’s Operation Yellowhammer document predicted extended delays to medical supplies because three-quarters of the UK’s medicines arrive via the Channel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9478bb605f7fe05b524a16b0f347807f65f0fbc/0_343_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f12fda26f02f20d0612b731d0753d7b","title":"john mcdonnell i cant see jeremy corbyn staying on if labour loses election","story":"Shadow chancellor says he would also resign and calls for a woman to become new leaderJeremy Corbyn would be likely to step down as Labour leader if the party loses the next election, John McDonnell has said, with the shadow chancellor adding that in such an event he would also probably quit his role.In an interview with GQ, McDonnell also raised the possibility of Labour potentially supporting a second Brexit referendum before a general election, an idea popular with some Labour MPs but so far resisted by Corbyn and his team.Speaking to Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former spokesman, who was expelled from Labour in May for voting for the Liberal Democrats in the European elections, McDonnell said seeking an election first remained the official policy.But he added: “I don’t think there is any doubt about a referendum. If it was a general election first or a referendum first, it doesn’t matter.”Asked whether Corbyn could stay on if Labour lost the next election, McDonnell accepted this appeared unlikely.“I can’t see ... I think it is the same for my own personal position, I can’t see so,” he said. “What we’d do is as the tradition, which is have an election for a new leader.“I’m still of the view now that whoever comes after Jeremy has got to be a woman. We’ve got to have a woman leader. If you look at the new youngsters that have come through, they are fantastic.”Corbyn has declined to say what he would do in such a situation. Asked previously whether he would stay on in the event of another election loss following a speech on Thursday, he did not respond to the question.However, McDonnell insisted that Labour could win a majority, and responded to the fact he would be facing a different opponent this time with Boris Johnson as prime minister.“I know that is true, but I also think he has got vulnerabilities just as much as Theresa May that we can expose and exploit in a campaign,” McDonnell said. “I’m not being unrealistic, but the political climate is incredibly unpredictable. You can’t use the usual gauge sticks.”The shadow chancellor said that if Labour did not win an outright majority but ended up the biggest party, they would not enter a formal coalition with the SNP or Liberal Democrats.“Well, I think we can win a majority, but if we go into a minority government situation, there will be no deals, we’ll just lay out our programme and they either support it or they don’t,” he said.“If they don’t support it we’ll go back to the country and it will be interesting, if they did, to see how they argue against a real living wage, investment in public services, restoration of trade union rights, tackling climate change. How can they argue against that?”On the choreography of whether a referendum should precede an election, McDonnell acknowledged the differences of opinion.“I’m more of the view that we’ve said up until now that we want a general election. That, of course, is what our objective is, but let’s see what actually parliament will wear in the end,” he said. “Within parliament itself there is a large number of people who are saying we’d rather have a referendum attached to any deal.”Asked what order he would prefer, McDonnell said: “I want a general election, actually. I would like a general election.”McDonnell, – who told Campbell he did not support his expulsion from Labour and would welcome him back – said Johnson’s approach to politics risked encouraging dangerously populist sentiments.“I don’t think Johnson has much of a belief at all. I think this is the ruthless pursuit of power for power’s sake,” he said.“That is why I caution him to be careful with what he’s unleashing here. What has happened in the past when these rightwing forces have been unleashed is that you’ve got a politician for who, literally, truth doesn’t matter to. Secondly, they start attacking the institutions that protect our democracy – parliament, judges, the rule of law.“Once you get into that territory, you’re into danger territory and you don’t know again how that will wind up and I think there are real issues there and lessons we’ve got to learn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c09777b8a527706f2a30d2134670870e569fd3d1/0_374_3266_1959/master/3266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef0133571ad4963a84ea298ad4436234","title":"michel barnier meets brexit secretary after uks positive talks with ireland","story":"EU gives go-ahead to weekend meetings after PM appears to backtrack on customs stanceBoris Johnson has signalled that he will make a last-ditch U-turn on his plans for the Irish border, setting up 48 hours of intense negotiations that will make or break a Brexit deal.On a day of rapid movement in talks, EU sources said the prime minister had conceded that there could not be a customs border on the island of Ireland – a critical step away from his previous position.That came after European ambassadors prompted tentative hope of a deal by giving the green light for what some diplomats described as a “tunnel” discussion in which a small team of negotiators meet for intensive talks to find a break-through moment. The Democratic Unionist party and European Research Group (ERG), a group of rightwing Conservatives, later issued statements promising flexibility, keeping hope alive that Johnson could find support for a new offer in the House of Commons.But amid ongoing scepticism that a deal could be forced through in the short time left and with Angela Merkel due to hold talks with Emmanuel Macron on Sunday night, the prime minister faces a frantic race to push through his fresh proposals with Brussels or at home.“The UK has accepted that there is not a deal that involves a border on the island of Ireland – that is a big break from what they were saying,” one EU source said. “Now the key is for them to lay out how their new position over the weekend.”On Friday, Johnson twice refused to deny that Northern Ireland could still stay in the EU’s customs territory after Brexit when asked by reporters on Friday.“I think it would be wrong of me to give a running commentary on the negotiations,” he said. “With the greatest possible respect I think, look at everything I’ve said previously. I think you can draw your own conclusions from that. But let our negotiators get on.”Johnson added: “I can certainly tell you that under no circumstances will we see anything that damages the ability of the whole of the United Kingdom to take full advantage of Brexit, and I think that’s what people would expect, and that’s what I think we can achieve.”Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.The \u0027backstop\u0027 in Theresa May\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a \u0027trap\u0027 to keep the UK in the EU\u0027s customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals.\u0026nbspInteractive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish borderDuring a briefing of EU ambassadors on Friday, Michel Barnier did not go into the detail of the UK’s new position. But he informed the diplomats that his two-hour breakfast with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had been notable for the apparent pivot by the British government.Following a meeting in the Wirral on Thursday, Johnson and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, had agreed that they could see a “pathway” to a deal.One option the EU might accept is a scaled-down version of the customs partnership proposed by Theresa May in 2017.Under the plan, Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union but the UK would agree to enforce the bloc’s customs rules and tariffs on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. There would be a rebate system to compensate businesses impacted.But EU sources suggested that there would not be sufficient time to work out the detail for the UK to leave on 31 October. “You don’t reinvent the wheel in five days,” said one senior diplomat. “We are still looking at an extension.”EU sources said Johnson had suggested to them that the DUP could be convinced by his recast vision for the border.The leader of the party, Arlene Foster, said on Friday her party of 10 MPs admitted “the need to be flexible and look at Northern Ireland specific solutions” in a statement.Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and chair of the ERG, said he and other members can “glimpse the possibility of this being a tolerable deal, however they want to see the wording of any agreement and expect a full briefing from No 10.The ERG has around 30 MPs in its group who consistently blocked May’s Brexit deal and are seen as a vital cohort to win over for Johnson to succeed.“We are all warmly disposed to backing a tolerable deal but until we have got a text we can’t say what we are going to do,” Baker told the .“I’ve been very, very, clear that the whole of the UK should leave the EU together. I’m not going to do anything until I can read the text of the agreement.”In EU capitals there remains considerable doubt that there is a viable solution in the pipeline that could be signed off by leaders at an EU summit next Thursday. A European commission spokesman formally announced the intensification of talks, as first revealed by the , in a statement reasserting its unmoved position.“The EU and the UK have agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days,” the commission’s statement said. “The EU’s position remains the same: there must be a legally operative solution in the withdrawal agreement that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, protects the all-island economy and the Good Friday (Belfast) agreement in all its dimensions, and safeguards the integrity of the single market.”EU diplomats said “ideas” and “elements” had been raised by Barclay that would “allow the negotiation teams to continue their efforts in search of a positive outcome”.Earlier in the day, the European council president, Donald Tusk, said he had set the prime minister an ultimatum of presenting new Brexit proposals by Friday or “no more chances”. He cautiously welcomed Wednesday’s developments in Wirral.Tusk warned, however, that “time was practically up” and there was “no guarantee” of success.“Johnson promised the EU to come forward with a solution that would work for all,” he said. “A solution that would not only satisfy the hardcore Brexiters but also solve our well-known and legitimate objectives: to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, to protect the Good Friday agreement, and ensure the integrity of the single market.“Unfortunately we are still in a situation in which the UK has not come forward with a workable realistic proposal.”A customs union means that countries agree to apply no or very low tariffs to goods sold between them, and to collectively apply the same tariffs to imported goods from the rest of the world. International trade deals are then negotiated by the bloc as a whole.For the EU, this means deals are negotiated by by Brussels, although inidual member state governments agree the mandate and approve the final deal. The EU has trade deals covering 69 countries, including Canada and South Korea, which the UK has been struggling to roll over into post-Brexit bilateral agreements.Proponents of an independent UK trade policy outside the EU customs union say Britain must forge its own deals if it is to take advantage of the world’s fastest-growing economies. However they have never explained why Germany manages to export more than three times the value in goods to China than Britain does, while also being in the EU customs union.Tusk said he told Johnson a week ago that “if there were no such proposals by today I would announce publicly that there are no more chances – because of objective reasons – for a deal for the incoming European council”.“However, yesterday, when the Irish taoiseach and the UK prime minister met they both saw for the first time a pathway to a deal. I have received promising signals from the taoiseach that a deal is still possible.”Tusk added that there was “no guarantee of success and the time is practically up, but even the slightest chance must be used”. “A no-deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU”, he said. Johnson’s controversial offer that the DUP would have a veto on post-Brexit border relations might also be removed as talks continue, one Tory MP said.“I think we would end up without the current consent veto, but some mechanism developed whereby the Irish parliament and Stormont have a say over the exit.“The DUP would be surrendering their veto and Sinn Fein would be getting a vote twice effectively on it, but for lack of anything better, that might be the solution where we might be had.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f5f5544599078b13c426649b4ebeb467bc10556/0_156_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da0104b4ce5b12bcb1f6e4836065b9c0","title":"northern ireland parties play down stormont being revived brexit","story":"Leaders voice scepticism about ending 998-day impasse, leaving obstacle to Brexit dealPolitical leaders in Northern Ireland have played down the prospect of reviving the Stormont assembly and executive, dampening a surge of optimism about a possible Brexit deal.Unionist and nationalist parties voiced scepticism on Friday that they could break the region’s 998-day political impasse, leaving a major obstacle in the path of British and EU negotiators in Brussels.Any Brexit deal is expected to require democratic consent for Northern Ireland’s continued alignment with the EU’s single market in goods, a conundrum with no obvious solution if Stormont remains mothballed.Almost 1,000 days on from the collapse of power-sharing, Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) traded blame for the paralysis and unveiled no plans to restore devolution at Stormont.Robin Swann, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), called the inability of Northern Ireland’s two biggest parties to share power an abject failure of politics. “Their toxic mixture of arrogance, disrespect and incompetence has led the country to where it is today,” he said.Stormont collapsed in January 2017 over a botched renewable heating initiative, the so-called cash for ash scandal. The biggest obstacle to the restoration of power-sharing is an Irish-language act.Colum Eastwood, the leader of the moderate nationalist SDLP, said there was negligible progress despite urgency over Brexit and atrophying public services. “The cold truth is that we are no closer to Irish-language legislation now than we were three years ago. We are facing a national emergency on this island as a no-deal Brexit draws nearer.”The murder of the journalist Lyra McKee in April by dissident republicans galvanised British and Irish officials to shepherd parties into talks at Stormont, with all sides expressing concern at armed groups filling the political void.Talks stalled amid mistrust between the DUP and Sinn Féin. Not even the imminent decriminalisation of abortion on 22 October – unless the assembly reconvenes before that date – persuaded the anti-abortion DUP to return.Naomi Long, the leader of the Alliance party, called the political stalemate “shameful”. A campaign group, We Deserve Better, is due to hold a protest outside Stormont on Sunday.The gloom in Belfast contrasted with hope in Brussels after British and EU negotiators got the green light to enter a “tunnel” of intense talks to try to hammer out a Brexit deal.There have been two key sticking points: Downing Street’s insistence on a customs border on the island of Ireland and a mechanism for gaining democratic consent for Northern Ireland’s alignment with the EU’s single market . The latter had raised anxiety in some quarters over a DUP veto on trading arrangements.Thursday’s meeting between Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, ended with both sides declaring a “pathway” to a possible Brexit deal, suggesting compromise on both issues.After speaking to Johnson later on Thursday Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the BBC there would not be a situation where “one community has a veto” over Brexit plans.He said there was “a range of options” for finding consent. He did not rule out a Northern Ireland-only referendum. “The key thing is we have to have regard to the Good Friday agreement and have regard to the need to have a cross-community approach to how we resolve this.”The absence of a DUP veto would alarm the party’s leaders – Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds – as well as its grassroots.Even more problematic would be any fudging on customs that could be interpreted as creating a border along the Irish Sea, a “blood red line” for a party dedicated to protecting Northern Ireland’s status in the UK.Rival unionists pounced on that possibility. Jim Allister, the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party, said: “If the proposals we’re beginning to hear about are correct it would totally disintegrate that economic unity … No matter how you dress it up, that is a fundamental assault upon our position within the United Kingdom.”Jim Nicholson, a UUP former MEP, said the region could be left on the “window ledge” of the union. “I fear that Northern Ireland is being offered up by Boris Johnson as the sacrificial lamb to save Brexit for the rest of the UK, the ERG and especially English nationalists.”There was no immediate response from DUP leaders. The party’s 10 Westminster MPs and influence over some hardline Tory Brexiters could make or break any deal that emerges from Brussels.Northern Ireland’s business community has repeatedly warned of ruin if the UK leaves without a deal. Two-thirds of the region’s small- and medium-sized enterprises with investment plans have either cancelled or postponed them owing to the uncertainty, according to the latest AIB Brexit Sentiment Index, a quarterly survey. Its Northern Ireland index has reached -41, an all-time low."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fca6e3685824d8b9bba53fab53c341781ad774/639_1035_5479_3288/master/5479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1958f04b1405ebc1a149c59f682d0cef","title":"brexit and the irish border is there a solution","story":"Lisa O’Carroll and Rory Carroll tell Anushka Asthana that solving the Irish border problem is still key to a Brexit deal.

Hostile briefings flowed out of Downing Street, enraging EU officials. Both sides now admit an agreement before the European council summit next week is unlikely. At the heart of all of this, one issue has remained unresolved: the Irish border.

For Nike, however, the termination of the project founded in 2001, where athletes lived in a low-oxygen environment and made use of low-gravity treadmills, is unlikely even to register a blip on the annual trading figures. In their grand scheme of things, any piece of controversy enhances one of the world’s mega-brands.Since the day in 1971 when Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman changed the name of their enterprise from Blue Ribbon Sports to Nike Inc, the trainers, T-shirts, sweat-pants and headbands with the swoosh trademark have become synonymous with a challenge to long-accepted codes of behaviour. Even staid old Wimbledon became a stage for Nike’s show as John McEnroe, at the height of his fame in 1978, signed with the company, which shrewdly exploited his habit of exploding into tantrums. The Brat’s box-office appeal was soon helping to move box-fresh trainers in large quantities as Nike challenged the hegemony of Adidas, which had benefited from long-established links and influence within sport’s traditional governing bodies.If you were over 25 and found yourself irritated by a Nike campaign, that meant the advertising and marketing departments were doing their job properly, although it would be hard to recreate today the outrage provoked during Euro 96 by a poster campaign built around a man who was then probably the most famous sporting figure in the country. “’66 was a great year for English football,” it said. “Eric was born.” The effrontery of it was breathtaking. A year earlier Nike had exploited the selfsame Cantona’s lengthy ban for kicking a spectator at Selhurst Park with a poster showing him about to emerge from the tunnel in his Manchester United kit: “He’s been punished for his mistakes. Now it’s someone else’s turn.”All kinds of adversity can be used to polish the brand’s charisma. Earlier this year Nike withdrew a new model of trainer – the Air Max Quick Strike Fourth of July – when Colin Kaepernick, the former NFL quarterback, and others pointed out that the Stars and Stripes emblazoned on the heel was an 18th century design, a version associated with the American Nazi Party. On past form, whatever short-term damage may have been caused by criticisms of the withdrawal from leading Republicans such as Senator Ted Cruz (“Nike only wants to sell to people who hate the American flag”) will be balanced by the benefits of association with an outsider hero like the man who refused to stand for the Star-Spangled Banner.The long-term success of Nike’s image-building could be seen this summer when a pair of unworn 47-year-old track shoes went for $437,000 (about £350,000) in a Sotheby’s auction. They were designed by Bowerman, an athletics coach and Nike co-founder, for US athletes taking part in the 1972 Olympic trials. Only 12 pairs were made, and few are said to survive. Inspired by the marks made on the moon’s surface by American astronauts, Bowerman poured rubber into his wife’s waffle iron to create the distinctive sole.The lucky purchaser was Miles Nadal, a Canadian investor. A few days earlier he had paid $850,000 for 99 other pairs of rare and limited-edition trainers. He is the billionaire version of every kid who ever stared at the window of a sports shop, lusting after some newly launched style.In the spirit of the Oregon Project, Kipchoge will run behind a rotating phalanx of 40 pacemakers, deployed in aerodynamic formations determined by the force and direction of the wind. They will be preceded by an electric car beaming laser lines on to the road to indicate exactly where they need to be to maintain the required schedule.This is not sport as it was once known. But no one has yet found a better way of persuading generations of rappers and skateboarders that buying the same sports kit is the best way to express your essential iniduality. The end of the Oregon Project is unlikely to change that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d81b18c47fcdc53054f298fc8da1c425bc897c/71_155_3262_1957/master/3262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6316b534797b948e0fba99442d45925b","title":"chris silverwood england root batsman captain giles","story":"It caused restless nights in the lead-up to the appointment, but Ashley Giles is pleased to have broken the cycle of England head coaches coming from overseas. And now with Chris Silverwood in place, the hope is that Joe Root’s best years with the bat are unlocked.Speaking about what he called “the biggest decision” of his first year as director of England cricket, Giles insisted he did not choose on nationality but Silverwood – only the second homegrown men’s head coach this century after Peter Moores – emerged as the best candidate regardless.After two years as the ever-amenable bowling coach under his predecessor as head coach, Trevor Bayliss, Giles expects Silverwood, a title-winning head coach from his time at Essex, to show more “steel” in the top job. He is not starting from scratch as regards working relationships, at least, having already developed a strong rapport with the Test captain Root and his one-day equivalent, Eoin Morgan.Giles readily admits that the needs of the former were more central during the recruitment process. Results-wise, England have been up and down under Root – they have won 17 Tests and lost 13, with only three draws – while his batting average of 40 during that time sits 12 runs lower than it was as a player alone.“We don’t want a coach who will come in and smother white-ball cricket and Eoin,” Giles said. “But we want someone who is going to give Joe more support, put more structure in place around him and together form the DNA of what a Test team looks like, which I don’t think we’ve quite got to yet.“That structure and support needs to go and allow Joe to average 50 with the bat, score hundreds and win Test matches. When it comes down to nuts and bolts that’s the most important thing because it takes the pressure off everyone.”Asked if Bayliss, a hands-off coach, left Root with more to do, Giles replied: “Yes, and that was Trev’s style. That was why the white-ball team flew. I’m sure up front when he came in with that method people thought ‘what the bloody hell’s going on here?’ Morgs ran into that space and took charge.While the World Cup continues to be paraded around the country, Giles is under no illusions that all is rosy in the garden. As well as looking to revive the Test team and sustain success in the white-ball formats, the former England spinner said he wants to remain vigilant where team culture is concerned.In a week when Ben Stokes and his wife, Clare, had to publicly deny that photographs taken at an awards ceremony depicted a physical altercation between them – and at a time when England’s male cricketers can earn wages north of the £1m mark – Giles is acutely aware of increased public scrutiny.On Stokes, Giles said: “It’s just a worry in some sense how his profile can be used against him, how susceptible they are as a family to this. I was pretty sure as soon as I saw the story there was nothing in it.“It was great to speak to both of them. Domestic violence is a really serious issue, we’re not making light of that at all. But in this instance it’s a very happy couple having some fun and a picture telling a thousand words – but just the wrong ones.”Stokes is not alone as regards negative headlines. Alex Hales is currently frozen out of the England set-up after serving a three-week recreational drug ban at the start of the summer while the careers of the Lions batsmen Joe Clarke and Tom Kohler-Cadmore have been stalled by their proximity to the case of Worcestershire’s Alex Hepburn, who was convicted for rape in April and is now serving five years in prison.In Stokes, who came back from the Bristol incident of 2017 to become the star of the past summer, Giles actually sees an example for the other three to follow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/821ef0285ac7c651998e027549ace5d20b96ce3e/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=304c0991e40f6b2a259169f8eeda73df","title":"world rugby contingency plan typhoon hagibis england france scotland japan cup","story":"World Rugby’s failure to properly prepare for Japan’s extreme weather can be revealed with World Cup organisers initially making plans to move England v France and other matches in Yokohama to Tokyo Stadium – just 14 miles away.Super Typhoon Hagibis has wreaked havoc on the World Cup with England’s Pool C decider in Yokohama cancelled and Scotland’s pivotal match with Japan, scheduled to take place in the same stadium on Sunday, in serious jeopardy. Hagibis is due to hit Tokyo and Yokohama on Saturday night local time and is forecast to be one of the most violent in recent history. It is measured at 870 miles wide.But despite years to come up with extensive contingency plans, with the tournament director, Alan Gilpin, insisting in 2018 that the threat of natural disasters was “a really hot topic for us”, it is understood that before the emergence of Hagibis, organisers considered the nearby Tokyo Stadium the most suitable alternative to Yokohama.When that inevitably became impossible, organisers hurriedly explored moving England’s match to Oita, more than 500 miles away on the south island of Kyushu. Ultimately it was decided that was not logistically viable nor safe for travelling supporters at such short notice.World Rugby has repeatedly insisted it has “robust contingency plans” but has not expanded any further and on Thursday, when it was confirmed England’s match with France and New Zealand’s encounter with Italy were cancelled, Gilpin revealed there were not any in place for Scotland’s game against Japan.Tens of thousands of supporters have been left in limbo in Tokyo and Yokohama and while they will receive a full refund for their match tickets, World Rugby will not reimburse any travel costs. The fact organisers considered a stadium 14 miles away would initially be an appropriate alternative venue raises huge question marks over World Rugby’s contingency planning.Had Oita, or Sapporo – 700 miles north of Yokohama – been designated as alternatives in the first place cancelled matches could have been avoided. “We always knew there would be risks but it’s rare for there to be a typhoon of this size at this stage of the year,” said Gilpin on Thursday. “We have no regrets.”In the absence of any contingency plans, Scotland v Japan will either take place on Sunday or be cancelled. Scotland, who face elimination if the match is called off, have countered by insisting the match should go ahead, even if it has to be behind closed doors. The Scottish union has also threatened legal action if the match is not played.England and France have both adopted philosophical approaches to their cancellation. England have headed to south to Miyazaki, where they held a pre-tournament camp, for the weekend. Eddie Jones had initially wanted to use Miyazaki as a base during the tournament, flying in and out to host cities.On Friday, clear of Hagibis’s path, England went through a light fitness session and are set to increase their workouts on Saturday in an effort to account for not having a match. All 31 players are set to train in some capacity on Saturday but players still nursing injuries, such as Billy Vunipola, are not expected to take a full part."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48a3fb540ca4947d4d76b5a053e8c4c563c46a1/0_458_4661_2797/master/4661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f06510cdcc84d8f4b5b19714a1219ab","title":"scotland japan rugby world cup tarnished quarter finals","story":"Firstly, some perspective. There are people living in the suburbs of Tokyo who still do not have electricity due to the typhoon that hit a month ago. Lives were lost and houses were destroyed. Hagibis, which has caused so much disruption to the World Cup schedule, is more than three times the size of the last one.Let’s put rugby to one side for a second. We’re all here living in this micro-bubble of the Rugby World Cup but in three or four weeks we pack our bags and go home. There are hundreds of thousands of people who live here who could be badly affected for the foreseeable future. I feel for the players, fans, organisers and everyone in the rugby world affected but my deepest sympathies go to the people of Japan, some of whom will have to rebuild their lives long after we leave.Don’t get me wrong, I’m as sad and frustrated as anyone that matches have been cancelled and that there are doubts over Japan v Scotland. As a commentator I want to be talking about the rugby, this beautiful country and the wonderful Japanese culture. Yet I entirely understand that when teams and unions have put in four years of preparation, when supporters have spent years saving to travel over here, there is anger and recrimination. There are so many stakeholders here and each has their own frustrations.I’ve had fans asking me for tickets for the quarter-finals on Instagram, you have the England players deployed to Miyazaki while their wives and families are under lockdown in Tokyo. It is affecting everyone. The one thing is that a lot of people back home do not understand the size of this typhoon. It’s not something that we ever see, we get a foot of snow and everything shuts down. This is the largest typhoon seen in Japan for more than a quarter of a century. In the UK it is usually Armageddon over some rain and a bit of frost.As things stand there is optimism that Japan against Scotland will go ahead. It just has to. The No 1 priority for the World Cup organisers is safety but the forecast for Sunday is sunshine. I fully expect that from inside the stadium on Sunday you would not know that there had just been a super typhoon. The problem is more likely to be logistical. Can the safety of fans getting to and from the stadium be guaranteed? But if it has to be played behind closed doors then so be it. I can guarantee that every Scotland player and supporter would rather it goes ahead in an empty stadium than not at all.The legacy of this World Cup depends on it. It’s the first time the Rugby World Cup has come to Asia and this is such a pivotal moment in how the tournament will be remembered. If the game goes ahead and we go on and have what should be a set of breathtaking knockout matches then we get back to talking about rugby. If the game is cancelled and Scotland go home then it tarnishes the competition. We’re already being reminded of what happened with Craig Joubert in 2015 but if Scotland go out because of a cancelled match it would be incomparable.It’s an incredibly tough situation for World Rugby to be in. A lot of people have turned into typhoon experts overnight, suggesting these decisions have been taken lightly. Regardless of whatever decision was made, it was going to be unsatisfactory to some. Whether it’s moving the games, changing the venue or changing the timings, it would have affected someone. It was just damage limitation, quite literally.What the organisers have tried to do is have one option which they can blanket across every single game. They can’t say we can move the venue for one match, but not another. They can’t differentiate in terms of the “importance” of the match. They have to be fair for everyone but in doing that, the upshot is that it is still wholly unfair on some, all which comes with the undercurrent of safety coming first.But I disagree with Sergio Parisse’s comments. I think it’s totally unfair on World Rugby to suggest that a different decision would have been taken if it were the All Blacks facing elimination. I totally understand his anger but I do not believe for a second World Rugby is acting in that way.Everyone knew the tournament rules and it must be said that Eddie Jones publicly acknowledged the threat from the start. He has experience of typhoons in Japan and was aware of how important it could be to pick up wins early. I know that the players were desperate for the game to go ahead and there were some players who could really have done with the minutes. But England will not be too disheartened and have the benefit of a few days back in the familiar surrounds of Miyazaki – another demonstration of Eddie’s local knowledge paying off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/335f168d0df97758f5e34dcd24f3dfae4644b4cf/302_508_2811_1686/master/2811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=130b352a90f4e55f56069f069c597a55","title":"keeping the show on track at the moulin rouge paris for 130 years","story":"The Moulin Rouge, the French cabaret famous for its high-kicking cancan dancers and flesh-exposing ostrich-feather costumes, this week marks 130 years since it first opened its doors to audiences.

People may not have responded to it as much in another period.”But Jesse Armstrong, Succession’s showrunner, was stumped as to why it had struck a chord on both sides of the Atlantic. “I honestly don’t know,” he said. “God only knows why that happens.” Succession, a melodrama about a media clan, the Roys, who jostle for position as their father’s health falters, has become a pop culture darling, inspiring thinkpieces on everything from its Greek and Roman references to its incredible array of knitwear. It won Armstrong an Emmy for best writing for a drama series. The show lacks any obviously redeemable character. “I wouldn’t say I like any of them,” said Prebble, adding that Shiv Roy, the duplicitous daughter and political adviser, was the most fun to write. “I wouldn’t want to be friends with any of them.”Prebble and Armstrong say the Roys were inspired by “corporate or dynastic families all over the world” rather than any one particular family. Armstrong encourages everyone in the writers’ room to read the Financial Times, Vanity Fair and New York Magazine to look out for stories about certain families. One figure from the Trump clan did fascinate them, said Prebble. “We always talked a lot about Donald Trump Jr and his childhood. Quite a lot of it is heartbreaking, but even knowing what they’ve been through it’s still very difficult to feel pity for these people.”Another clear inspiration is the Murdoch clan, who aren’t the show’s biggest fans. “I don’t watch Succession … why would I?” James Murdoch, who is thought to have inspired Jeremy Strong’s character, Kendall Roy, told the New Yorker. Brian Cox, who plays the bellicose, power-hungry patriarch, Logan Roy, said he was stopped in the street in London by a man who told him he was enjoying the show but his wife found it hard to watch. When Cox asked why, the man – Keith Tyson, the Turner prize winning artist – explained he was married to Elisabeth Murdoch, the daughter of Rupert and sister of the Fox Corporation CEO, Lachlan Murdoch.For Prebble, any denials from the Murdochs are a positive signal. “If something is genuinely biting and satirical then the subjects pretend they haven’t seen it,” she said. “I don’t think Trump has the attention  to watch a whole episode.”The Washington Post TV critic Alyssa Rosenberg says the appeal of Succession is rooted in schadenfreude, as viewers who feel powerless to stop abuses of power in the real world can enjoy some recompense via their TV. “It’s weirdly reassuring in that it tells you over and over again that these people might act with impunity but it’s OK because eventually they will destroy themselves,” she said.According to Prebble, when wealthy consultants came in to give them guidance on the super rich, they would never be able to answer the question: what happens when you’ve earned enough money? “Every time they would look at us blankly and say that really doesn’t happen. People who are driven to be that wealthy, there isn’t an amount at which they stop.”Armstrong said: “I go away from those meetings with this buzzing sense that you’ve unlocked this world, then I look at my notes and it says something like ‘rich people like lobster’. Meeting these people is important but actually if you read the books about Maxwell or Murdoch they’re full of amazing stories.”Viewing figures for Succession are not remarkable – it debuted with 1.2 million in the US for its second season premiere, compared with the record-breaking 19.3 million viewers who tuned in for the Game of Thrones finale. But when compared to similarly critically adored shows such as Mad Men, which pulled in 3.3 million viewers for its finale in the US, Succession has done enough to convince HBO to greenlight a third season. HBO praised the show’s exploration of wealth, power and family and said it had “resonated powerfully with audiences”.Rosenberg believes it is too early to say if the show can emulate previous prestige dramas such as Mad Men and The Sopranos, which influenced everything from fashion to other TV. “I have read about a dozen posts about Shiv’s style but I’m not sure we’re going to have a Succession line of clothes in Banana Republic any time soon,” she said. “The old-fashioned has an inherent sexiness, and Mad Men revived that, but the cable knit sweater is a little bit of a harder sell.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ee007eb986815f3a1cc3749e33f7626ab90d461/0_181_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c525b2d953b31f69acf44ec71b4edd5b","title":"the name of the rose review john turturro umberto eco","story":"Rupert Everett steals the show as an evil inquisitor, but this messy adaptation of Umberto Eco’s mystery in the abbey requires the patience of a saint to followIt’s monk soup, basically. Within 20 minutes of the start of John Turturro’s passion project, The Name of the Rose (BBC Two), an adaptation of the Umberto Eco novel in which he stars, having executive produced and co-scripted it with three other writers, we are drowning in them.Turturro plays William of Baskerville, a learned and diplomatic Franciscan friar on his way to an abbey in northern Italy to try and settle the hashes of Ludwig the Bavarian (Holy Roman Emperor-in-waiting, because this is 1327 and all sorts is kicking off) and Pope John XXII, who have vastly different opinions about how medieval religion and politics should be separated and just how closely the clergy should follow Christ’s annoying teachings about poverty.William accrues a follower on the way, an almost-Benedictine baby monk called Adso (Damian Hardung). He, in turn, is followed by a young Occitan refugee known only as the Girl after he showed her some basic human kindness on their way across the Alps. I think. It’s all quite dark, and monks and Occitan peasants wear a lot of earth tones so it is hard to tell.As they make their way across picturesque terrain, John XXII at the papal palace is briefing his religious inquisitor Bernardo Gui (Rupert Everett, whose beautifully cruel countenance perfectly suits the sadist’s role) to attend the conference in his stead. Nothing can go wrong here.As they near the abbey, they intersect with a group of brothers trying to determine which way their abbot’s runaway horse has fled. William, who turns out to be a kind of tonsured Sherlock Holmes, deduces the answer in seconds.They reach the abbey, and we are submerged in the flood of Benedictine brothers. Venantius, Remigio, Berengar, Malachi – the list goes on, but only two are readily distinguishable: Jorge, who is blind and irascible, and the very blond Benno, who looks like a mendicant Malfoy. Oh, and Adelmo, who is dead. He fell from a window.As the difficulty of unlocking the windows precludes accidents, William realises the abbot must consider it murder rather than (sinful) suicide. The abbot begs him to find the killer or killers before the papal and Ludwiggian delegates arrive. William does the rounds, asking questions, hearing about the mysterious library housed in a labyrinth at the abbey, and uncovering many tensions along the way. Malfoy is particularly forthcoming, but because the script is so oblique it is hard to know about what.Therein lies the problem with The Name of the Rose: it’s a mess. There is something to be said for knowing one’s limitations. And if you don’t have the mastery of semiotic and literary theory, years of Bible study and immersion in medieval aesthetics that will enable you to make sense of a book by a man who had exactly that at his back, then perhaps … don’t try? Either reread his masterpiece and sigh with pleasurable yearning, or cut your cloth accordingly and at least give the viewer a decent murder-mystery to follow. Still, by the end we are able to pick another monk out of the lineup. Venantius is the one hanged upside down in a bucket of pigs’ blood, very drowned and very dead. This definitely does not look like an accident or suicide. The abbey is beginning to seem more dangerous even than medieval Shrewsbury or interwar St Mary Mead. I’ll stick around for a bit more of Everett’s face and a look at the library labyrinth, but if things don’t streamline substantially, I will have to gather my horse and away.﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c51abc53fd475a670f50d1a682876d82fa823b9a/0_137_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c39973a549b98bf85c0ddde9a43ba2b3","title":"abiy ahmed ethiopian prime minister wins 2019 nobel peace prize","story":"Award recognises efforts for peace, in particular in resolving Eritrea border conflictThe prime minister of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, who forged a peace deal with Eritrea last year, has won the 2019 Nobel peace prize.The award recognised Abiy’s “efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation, and in particular his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea”, said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the Norwegian Nobel committee’s chair.One of Abiy’s biggest achievements since coming to power in April last year was the peace deal signed three months later, which ended a nearly 20-year military stalemate with Eritrea following their 1998-2000 border war.Abiy has also pushed through reforms at home, dramatically changing the atmosphere in what was regarded as a repressive state. His public renunciation of past abuses drew a line between his administration and those of his predecessors, as did the appointment of former dissidents and large numbers of women to senior roles.Abiy said: “I am so humbled and thrilled ... thank you very much. It is a prize given to Africa, given to Ethiopia, and I can imagine how the rest of Africa’s leaders will take it positively to work on the peace-building process in our continent.”Other figures who were considered in the running for this year’s prize included the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Hong Kong pro-democracy activists.Ninety-nine Nobel peace prizes have been awarded since 1901, to iniduals and 24 organisations. While the other Nobel prize laureates are announced in Stockholm, the peace prize is awarded in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.Abiy, 43, a former military officer specialising in cyber intelligence, has forged a reputation as a daring leader prepared to take risks to tackle decades-old problems.Abiy Ahmed becomes prime minister of Ethiopia after a leadership election among the ruling coalition, following the surprise resignation of Hailemariam Desalegn in February.Abiy frees thousands of political detainees, including the opposition leader Andargachew Tsege, who had been facing the death penalty. Abiy invites him to his office within 24 hours of his release.Parliament approves lifting the Ethiopian national state of emergency, two months before it is due to expire.Abiy agrees to accept a 2002 border ruling giving disputed territory to Eritrea. The war between the two has raged on and off since Eritrea gained independence in the early 90s.A grenade attack targeting Abiy kills two people, and injures more than 165. The blame is placed on internal factions opposed to reform.\u0026nbspThe Eritrean president Isaias Afwerki hosts Abiy in Asmara, more than two decades since Ethiopian and Eritrean leaders last met in person. Cheering crowds line the streets, and direct telephone communications are restored between the countries.The two leaders sign a joint declaration declaring that the “state of war that existed between the two countries has come to an end”.With both countries having reopened their embassies, and commercial flights between the two capitals resumed, land border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea are reopened for the first time in 20 years. Five days later a peace agreement is signed in Saudi Arabia.Abiy appoints women to half of the ministerial posts in the country, including Sahle-Work Zewde as the first female president. He receives an African excellence award for gender from the African Union for the move.\u0026nbspAbiy’s rule is not without its problems. It is estimated that more than\u0026nbspa million\u0026nbspEthiopians were forced from their homes by ethnic violence in 2018, and he attracts criticism for initiating a programme that seems determined to drive people back to their homes, even if it does not seem safe.Abiy Ahmed wins the 2019 Nobel peace prizeThe peace deal with Eritrea surprised and delighted tens of millions of people across east Africa. The conflict had cost both countries dearly in lives and scarce resources, and was a brake on development across much of the volatile region.Eritrea, which has a population of about 4 million, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year guerrilla war.The Nobel committee acknowledged that “peace does not arise from the actions of one party alone”.More recently Abiy played a key role in brokering a political deal in neighbouring Sudan that halted a slide into violence after the fall of the veteran dictator Omar al-Bashir, while retaining many of the gains made by pro-democracy protesters.António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said winds of hope were blowing across Africa.“This milestone has opened up new opportunities for the region to enjoy security and stability, and Prime Minister Ahmed’s leadership has set a wonderful example for others in and beyond Africa looking to overcome resistance from the past and put people first,” Guterres said.Abiy, who often relies on bold personal initiatives and charisma to drive change instead of working through government institutions, is the country’s first leader from its largest ethnic community, the Oromo, who have long complained of economic, cultural and political marginalisation.Domestic reforms have included lifting bans on political parties, releasing imprisoned journalists and sacking a number of previously untouchable officials, some of them accused of torture. Abiy also appointed women to half the ministerial posts in his cabinet.In Addis Ababa, larged crowds have been welcoming home exiled dissidents. Residents who once feared speaking publicly about politics now talk of little else. Flags and symbols long banned by the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) fly across the city.Other initiatives, such as the planting of millions of trees, have won further international support.Born in western Ethiopia, Abiy joined the resistance against the regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam as a teenager before enlisting in the armed forces, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. He has a doctorate in peace and security studies.After a stint running Ethiopia’s cyber intelligence service, he entered politics eight years ago and rose rapidly up the ranks of the Oromo faction of the EPRDF, which has historically been at odds with the Tigrayans.Analysts say Abiy’s mixed Christian and Muslim background and his fluency in three of the country’s main languages help him to bridge communal and sectarian ides.Dino Mahtani, a deputy director of International Crisis Group’s Africa programme, said: “Abiy’s award is a reflection of the west’s hope for transformational change in Ethiopia. But peace in Ethiopia is under threat by outbreaks of violence following Abiy’s political liberalisation project that, despite all its good intentions, has also contributed to unleashing centrifugal political forces in the country.”In an interview with the  shortly after Abiy survived an apparent assassination attempt in 2018, one of his personal acquaintances said the leader was “always looking ahead for the future”. Former colleagues said shelves of books on religion, philosophy and science filled Abiy’s office.“He is physically active and very well organised ... He did not have a secretary because he wanted his office to be accessible. His office door was literally never closed,” one said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5bc159b2784f8c7051b6a99c93fbb3ff20b866b/0_300_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3232ea12e8fa4e0077fe4450af2a8cca","title":"kurdish civilians flee turkish forces sustain bombardment syria","story":"Airstrikes and shells hit north-east as Trump raises possibility of sanctions on AnkaraWhat is happening in north-east Syria?Kurdish civilians have been fleeing key towns in north-eastern Syria as Turkish forces continue to bombard targets for a third consecutive day.Donald Trump has also raised the possibility of imposing sanctions on Ankara. There were reports on Friday of airstrikes and shelling in Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad, the Kurdish-held towns that have borne the brunt of the fighting, as Turkish ground troops and their allies sought to close in on both.Thousands of civilians have fled from both towns as well as surrounding villages, and a camp of at least 4,000 displaced Syrians near Ras al-Ayn has been evacuated after Turkish artillery landed nearby, Kurdish administrators said.Turkey’s vice-president said on Friday evening that his country’s troops had advanced five miles into north-eastern Syria.Kurdish activists reported at least one car bomb explosion outside a popular restaurant in the town of Qamishli on Friday afternoon, amid fears that Islamic State might use the fighting to launch its own attacks. A Kurdish media collective, the Rojava Information Centre, said one person was killed and no group has yet claimed responsibility.Tel Abyad’s hospital was closed after most of its staff left, Médecins Sans Frontières said. “Our staff in Tel Abyad witnessed the town, that was once filled with life, become deserted,” said Robert Onus, the group’s emergency manager for Syria.The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, told his Turkish counterpart to halt the offensive or risk “serious consequences for Turkey”, but it is unclear what effect that would have on a government in Ankara that believes it has the backing of the US president.“As part of the call, Secretary Esper strongly encouraged Turkey to discontinue actions in north-eastern Syria in order to increase the possibility that the United States, Turkey and our partners could find a common way to de-escalate the situation before it becomes irreparable,” a Pentagon account of the call said.About 64,000 people have fled Syria since the campaign began, according to the International Rescue Committee aid group. The Kurdish Red Crescent said on Thursday night that 11 civilians had been killed in the fighting, including an 11-year-old boy in Qamishli.Clashes were reported overnight at different spots along the border, from Ain Diwar at the Iraqi frontier, to Kobane, more than 250 miles (400km) to the west.Kurdish officials in al-Hawl camp, where around 400 guards watch over more than 60,000 female members of Isis and their children, claimed there were violent demonstrations on Friday morning which they characterised as a failed escape attempt. Such unrest has been frequent in the camp in recent months.The reports of the fighting, as well as concerns over the fate of about 11,000 detained Isis fighters and their families fuelled criticism of the Turkish offensive in Washington, where the president is under increasing pressure to lay down red lines for Ankara.Trump’s abrupt decision on Sunday to clear US soldiers from the Turkish-Syrian border in effect gave Turkey a green light to attack the US-backed and Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). It has led to withering criticism from his allies in Congress, the evangelical movement and Israel.Trump said on Thursday that he hoped he could mediate between Turkey and the SDF but kept open the possibility of doing “something very, very tough with respect to sanctions and other financial things” against Ankara.A senior US official told the  that certain Turkish actions could trigger sanctions.The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, has called for an emergency meeting of the coalition of more than 30 countries created to fight Isis. France’s European affairs minister said next week’s EU summit would discuss sanctions on Turkey over its action in Syria.The SDF remained in control of the camps and prisons holding Isis detainees and their families, a US state department official said.Turkish defence officials claim their forces have killed 277 Kurdish militants, a figure that could not be verified. They have confirmed the death of two soldiers, the latest on Friday afternoon."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit a day in the life of an irish border crossing","story":"Ambrose “Bo” McGurgan is checking the tyres on his six-axle lorry at the Applegreen truck stop near Castlebellingham, Co Louth, south of the Irish Border. It is the only check he will undergo before crossing over into Northern Ireland.From the end of this month all that could change with the UK’s exit from the EU on October 31st, the date British prime minister Boris Johnson wants Brexit to happen.McGurgan fears the return of the dreaded customs checks of more than a quarter century ago. He remembers the hard border when 300 or 400 trucks could be parked up for hours awaiting customs clearance.“It will be going back to square one, like in the 70s. It would be a disaster. You could be sitting all day in Dundalk waiting to get cleared,” he tells The .It is 11am on a Monday and the Armagh man has been working for six hours and has already lifted and “tipped” a trailer in Dublin and is heading across the Border for another delivery in Newtownards, Co Down.He is hauling a mixed load of food and industrial goods – sauces and engineering bolts – but requires no paperwork as he drives, unhindered, across an open border between two jurisdictions currently within the EU. A return to the border of the past, that McGurgan waited hours to cross. is very real again.Johnson’s government proposed to the EU last week to replace the contentious backstop guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border with a plan to impose a new customs border on the island of Ireland.The deluge of paperwork, the queues of lorries, the hours-long delays, the potential targeting of customs officers by people upset with the return of a visible border “would be a disaster,” says McGurgan.“People don’t realise how bad it is going to be. We, the older generation, we have done it all. We know how bad it is. There will be customs men shot. There will be. Everybody is fighting for a loaf,” he said.McGurgan’s truck was one of 6,639 goods vehicles to cross the Border on the A1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast last Monday. This is the busiest crossing on the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Traffic counters operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the agency monitoring the State’s roads, show that on average five goods vehicles crossed this point of the Border every minute on Monday.This is where the impact of the UK leaving without a deal has the potential to cause the most complications.Next to McGurgan’s truck is fellow haulier Brendan McParland, also a veteran Border-crosser. He is heading to Dungannon, Co Tyrone, with a load of peat after dropping plasterboard in Athy, Co Kildare.He usually hauls European steel, landed at Warrenpoint in Co Down, across the Border to Dublin, Kilkenny or Carlow. Normally he can complete two return runs to Dublin in one day from Warrenpoint.“If the Border was to come, you couldn’t guarantee you would even get one load done,” he said, munching on a sandwich in the cab of his lorry.Michael Harbinson is one of several lorry drivers stopped at Applegreen transporting Coca-Cola products from its manufacturing facility in Knockmore Hill outside Belfast to customers in the Republic.He believes an all-island economic unit is the way to avoid a hard Border. Not everyone wants this when it comes to both customs and EU single market rules north and south. The DUP also wants Northern Ireland to be able to vote to opt in to an all-island zone covering EU single market rules for goods every four years.“If the North takes a deal still tied with the South, it is the best of both worlds. It is the DUP who is ruining it. They just stand firm in their stance,” said Harbinson.At the last junction before the southern M1-N1 crosses the Border and turns into the northern A1 there is a fuel service station. It lies between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.Colin Byrne, one of the pump attendants of the junction 20 service station, has no clue how the UK and EU would manage this Border if Britain leaves without a deal.“That’s the six million dollar question. Sure how many back roads are there across the Border. It is not doable, simply not doable,” he said.Johnson has ruled out customs checks at or near the Border but has not specified in his plan where “designated locations” for some required checks might be. Byrne offers a foretaste of how checks might work: “every once in a while,” he says, the Garda and customs check vehicles at the southbound exit 18 off the M1 into Dundalk. “If you saw the mayhem that that causes,” he said.On the bridge over the A1 dual-carriageway next to the Carrickdale Hotel there is a constant drone of noise as an “artic” or smaller “rigid” lorry or a light goods vehicle is always coming or going.This is the north-south White Van Man highway.Between 5am and 7pm last Monday – the busiest period of the day – 5,722 goods vehicles cross the Border. That is one goods vehicle every eight seconds. This traffic is split 50:50 in either direction.“It shows trade is equally balanced going in either direction,” said Séamus Leheny, policy manager of the Freight Transport Association, speaking loudly to be heard over the hum of traffic on the bridge.“It is the artery of trade on the island of Ireland. It connects the two largest cities and to have any type of barrier on this, or ersions, or checks, it would inhabit trade and growth economically on either side of the Border here.”Interrupting the flow of traffic here would have a huge impact, he says lorries would “soon stack up” and could be waiting hours if they had to have paperwork inspected or their load physically inspected.The stakes on finding a fix to the Brexit-Border conundrum are high. Leheny explains that five times as much freight crosses the Irish Border than moves between Northern Ireland and Britain, the North’s biggest market, but it is lower in value because it is mostly ingredients and components, and not completed products.“What we make in Northern Ireland, it is comprised of bits and pieces sourced from every corner of the island of Ireland. If we have a hard border, the existence of those products that we make in Northern Ireland are jeopardised because you would have delays, tariffs and the sanitary controls as well,” he said.In the retail game, this Border crossing is an essential supply chain route for multinationals. Northern Ireland supermarkets are stocked from distribution centres in the Republic, and vice versa. Then there are the food products made with ingredients coming from both north and south of the Border.Aodhán Michael Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says that a supermarket chicken salad sandwich can have ingredients involving six border movements (north-south and east-west, between the North and Britain), while “the humble cottage pie” can have eight, including a cheese topping produced and processed on different sides of the Border. Each movement involves tariffs so the overall costs could be huge.“That border crossing isn’t just to move goods A to B. It is a lifeline to the supply chain and to those small and medium-sized enterprises right down to the farmers who are in our supply chain,” he said. “If there isn’t frictionless movement across that border, each of those costs will have to go down the supply chain and it is going to make things tougher for the Northern Ireland consumer.”Connolly sees Johnson’s plan as “unworkable” if it is the final deal because a customs border would amount to a hard border, but it is “progress” to open negotiations because it includes an all-island zone for goods.Driving one of his nine trucks across the Border on the A1, Declan Trainor, a cattle and goods haulier, believes the island of Ireland should be “treated as a whole and as one island”.He has no idea how the Border, just a few hundred metres from his office at Carrickcarnan, will look on November 1st, or how he will be able to continue transporting tiles from mainland Europe to Northern Ireland.“It is the unknown. That is the scary part. The Government hasn’t really said how to prepare for it. They are only guessing themselves now so how are you supposed to prepare?” he said. “You don’t know whether it is a dance you are going to or a war. Sure how do you dress for it?”Speaking a few days later, Trainor says Johnson’s “two borders for four years” proposal has left him even more confused. It has also made people who rely on free trade and free movement of goods across the Border “desperate,” he said.“Whatever concern we had, we are more concerned now,” he said.How busy is the M1A1\u0026nbspcrossing?The Border crossing on the M1 motorwayA1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast is the busiest thoroughfare along the 499-kilometre open frontier between the Republic and Northern Ireland.The four-lane crossing between Newry and Dundalk is about five times busier than the next busiest crossing over the Blackwater river between Emyvale, Co Monaghan, and Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, based on traffic figures counted daily by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the State agency that manages the Irish road network.The agency uses a system of counters under the surface of strategically important roads across the country that can differentiate vehicles by wheel axle lengths. This allows the agency to gather data and analyse the volume of traffic and type of vehicles passing on the road for every hour of every day.The counter at Junction 20 on the A1 at Ravensdale between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth, showed that Monday, September 30th – a month before the UK’s scheduled exit from the EU – was a typically busy day for traffic for this major transport route on the island of Ireland.Some 25,301 vehicles crossed the Border over the 24-hour period: 18,175 cars, 6,639 goods vehicles (including the heaviest articulated lorries), 318 buses and 24 motorbikes. That means 17 vehicles crossed the Border on average every minute last Monday. One goods vehicle crossed the Border every 12 seconds.Hauliers, traders and businesses along the Border say any kind of delays stopping traffic on this corridor after Brexit would quickly result in heavy congestion and tailbacks.The busiest times of day are during the morning rush-hour between 8am and 9am, when traffic volumes peaked at 1,935 vehicles, and the late afternoon peak between 4pm and 5pm at 1,897 vehicles.The bulk of the traffic crosses the Border between the hours of 7am and 7pm when 19,625 vehicles were counted last Monday, or on average of 1,635 an hour.The traffic is evenly split between northbound and southbound vehicles. However, more than twice as many goods vehicles head southbound between 5am and 9am – making deliveries to the Republic or transporting goods to Dublin Port in time to make the 8am ferry departures to England out of Dublin Port.This route is a critical artery for goods travelling from Northern Ireland south into the Republic. Some 3,425 goods vehicles crossed the Border heading south into the Republic last Monday.This worked out an average of 143 per hour. In other words, one goods vehicle crossed the Border into the Republic on the main Dublin-Belfast road every 25 seconds last Monday.To put this in a national context, this part of the A1 is almost as busy or busier every day than the main Dublin to Galway M4 road at Kinnegad (26,400 vehicles on average a day), the main Dublin to Cork M7 road at Portlaoise (25,700 vehicles) and than the main Dublin to Wexford M11 road at Arklow (22,800 vehicles).Cross-Border workersTen minutes drive south of the Border, dozens of parked cars – nearly all Northern Irish-registered vehicles – line either side of the road off Junction 17 of the M1 near Dundalk in Co Louth.They belong to Northern Irish tradesmen, mostly from across the Border in south Armagh, who park and car-pool into the Republic for work. They are mostly construction works, plumbers and electricians.“There are thousands of people going to and from work every day, crossing the Border every couple of minutes. There are thousands and thousands of guys down south working and Dublin is most of where the work is,” said Neil Byrne, a plumber from Mullaghbane near Forkhill.The Armagh man usually arrives at around 5.50am to park his car and catch his lift to Dublin. He has worked “all over the south” including in Kildare and Athlone.Byrne says he and his fellow commuters to the Republic are concerned about a crash-out Brexit and the return of a hard border resulting in hours and hours of traffic delays crossing the Border.He doesn’t believe a hard border would work it does not make sense to have one, he says. “It is one small country in my opinion: it doesn’t matter whether you are north or south, Ireland is Ireland and you have to get to your work regardless,” he said.Delays and traffic jams are not his only worry.“If there’s a Border, it has the whole issue of the Troubles starting again because in my own personal opinion it is going to happen the exact same way it did back then: customs guys get attacked, then there is a police presence, then they get attacked and then there is a military presence,” he said. “It doesn’t take much to set it off.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Aaron ChownPA Wire.The DUP remains opposed to a UK or Northern Ireland only Brexit backstop and anything that “traps” Northern Ireland in the single market or customs union, its party leader has said. With talks between the UK and the EU set to “intensify” in the coming days, Arlene Foster said on Friday that her party “will always exercise our considerable influence in ensuring we stand up for Northern Ireland”. “We will only ever consider supporting arrangements that are in Northern Ireland’s long-term economic and constitutional interests,” she said. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and British prime minister Boris Johnson met on Thursday and it has been reported since that some form of customs border in Irish Sea is likely to be explored as an alternative to the backstop, an insurance policy included in the withdrawal agreement reached by Theresa May and the EU which aims to avoid the need for border checks on the island of Ireland. Ms Foster said her party was in regular contact with Mr Johnson, who is “aware of our views”. She said the leave vote in the EU membership referendum in 2016 was the “people’s verdict and it must be delivered”. “To do otherwise would be anti-democratic,” she added in a statement. Ms Foster reiterated the DUP’s opposition to any backstop “...whether UK or NI only, and anything that traps Northern Ireland in the European Union, whether Single Market or Customs Union, as the rest of the United Kingdom leaves will not have our support”. She said Mr Johnson is “very mindful of that”. ‘Sensible’Ms Foster expressed the DUP’s desire for “a balanced and sensible” Brexit deal which had the support of unionists and nationalists. “The DUP has always indicated that the United Kingdom must leave the EU as one nation and in so doing that no barriers to trade are erected within the UK.” She said the EU must accept “the economic and constitutional integrity of the whole of the United Kingdom will have to be respected as we leave”. “As a consequence of the mandate given to us by voters in 2017, the DUP is very relevant in the parliamentary arithmetic and regardless of the ups and downs of the Brexit discussions that has not changed,” she said. “We will judge any outcome reached by the Prime Minister against the criteria above.” Former Ulster Unionist Party MEP Jim Nicholson said he was “concerned Northern Ireland is being offered up as a sacrificial lamb in Brexit negotiations”. “I have watched with increasing concern at how events have unfolded in the last few months,” he said. “I fear that Northern Ireland is being offered up by Boris Johnson as the sacrificial lamb to save Brexit for the rest of the UK, the ERG and especially English nationalists.” Mr Nicholson was critical of the DUP, saying the party had “completely wasted” its influence at Westminster. “If Northern Ireland is left sitting on the window ledge of the union, on their head be it,” he added.

Photograph: Noel MullenGovernment Press Office via Getty ImagesClimbers on the notorious north face of the Eiger in Switzerland often battle against ferocious life-threatening storms while the village of Grindelwald less than 2km below basks in sunshine and gentle breezes. The Brexit talks were a little like that this week, with the political storms telling only part of the story. Something else was also afoot, something calmer, more deliberate and so lacking in drama that it passed unnoticed. When Boris Johnson disclosed his “two borders, four years” Brexit plan at the Conservatives’ conference on October 2nd, it was met with negativity. Immediately, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said: “It does not seem like the basis of an agreement, that’s for sure.” Similar reactions came from EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.“It was an unusual day that Wednesday,” said a highly-placed Government source. “There were conflicting messages coming from Downing Street. We got briefings in the morning, a request for a phone call from Boris Johnson, and a conversation where the British indicated it was their clear intention to get a deal.”That ergent narrative from Downing Street would continue for the next eight days. The more declamatory stuff that emerged was believed to reflect the position of Dominic Cummings, the Downing Street chief of staff. It included the leak to James Forsyth of The Spectator which cast Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as the villain of the piece, as well the unprecedented decision of Downing Street to crudely paraphrase German chancellor Angela Merkel’s stance on the customs issue. “That was Beano and Dandy stuff, comic book fantasy. It was a disgrace,” said a senior Opposition figure. The effect of it was obvious. By the time the pivotal meeting between Varadkar and Johnson was arranged the blame game was well established, and the bilateral summit portrayed as a “last throw of the dice”. If there was mood music, it was Mozart’s funeral requiem. Ambiguous languageBut in private, engagement was intensifying between the Irish and British governments on a far more considered basis. Despite Boris’s blowhard bluster, there had been some movement in the British position since he became prime minister. For example, Johnson told middle-of-the-road Tories he would not include a no-deal Brexit in the party’s election manifesto. He also convinced the DUP to agree to Northern Ireland remaining in the single market. Even his “two borders, four years” proposal was not that clear-cut. Seasoned negotiators like Bertie Ahern could not help but notice the ambiguous language in it. “He was saying that Northern Ireland would be fully part of UK custom territory at the end of transition, or beyond,” Ahern told The . “I read from that he was prepared to leave the customs situation as is until the end of 2020 or longer.“If he was prepared to do that and acknowledge that Northern Ireland could stay within the EU customs union during that period that was altering the whole ethos of the backstop.“He was leaving space for the customs arrangement to remain without a definite end date.”The behind-the-scenes engagement was busying up. Two officials had secretly travelled from Downing Street to talk to the Department of the Taoiseach’s second secretary general John Callinan, the Taoiseach’s point person on Brexit. When their presence was reported in the London Times it led to a furious row in the Dáil. Two other highly skilled officials from the Taoiseach’s office, the State’s top civil servant Martin Fraser and assistant secretary Helen Blake, were also now fully involved. Meanwhile, Coveney had cultivated strong relations with the impressive new Northern Secretary Julian Smith, and was also liaising with Barnier and the EU Brexit negotiations taskforce. The British embassy in Dublin was communicating with the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs on a daily basis. “We discussed a number of venues, including Edinburgh and Manchester. We did not want to go to Downing Street. We wanted a venue that could be considered neutral. In the end we chose Liverpool as we could meet halfway between Dublin and London,” The  was told by the source.At this stage, there were two clear obstacles: consent in Northern Ireland and customs. Consent was considered doable the big wrangle would be over customs. However, on the eve of the meeting this reporter met a very senior figure in Government who expressed optimism that a deal was possible. Given the bleak coverage of the issue, it seemed like wishful thinking. The Irish delegation comprised of 10 people, including Callinan, Fraser, Blake and the Taoiseach’s special adviser Brian Murphy. There was a frisson of nervousness in relation to the outcome of the meeting. “To be honest, the expectations going over were uncertain and unclear, especially given the briefings that were emanating from Downing Street,” said the source.Unusual encounterThe meeting was unusual. It was the third meeting between the two leaders, but unlike the others, where the one-on-one encounters lasted no more than 15 minutes, this continued for three hours. The two leaders have built up a relatively cordial relationship, which was obvious in their body language. While Varadkar was prepared to listen (and, possibly, to compromise) the understanding was that it was the British who needed to move. “Boris needed to blink first, and he did,” said another Government source familiar with what happened.It was also unusual as the first time the State did not delegate the primary negotiations to the EU, although everything that occurred before and after was relayed to, and approved by, Barnier. In the end a form of Northern Ireland-only backstop formed the basis of the resolution. Details of it emerged late on Friday afternoon. There was no doubt this was a breakthrough moment. The news was met with astonishment. The Government was anxious to keep it in proportion. “Many is the slip betwixt cup and lip,” Varadkar reminded his audience at a press conference later on Wednesday. “We have to stay level-headed. We are heading into the tunnel but that does not mean a deal. It’s important not to underestimate the difficulties that lie ahead,” was the source’s conclusion on where things stand now.

Photograph: NIck BradshawA referendum to give voting rights to Irish citizens living outside the State in presidential elections is now unlikely to take place until the new year.The Bill to amend the Constitution was published last month, and a Referendum Commission established, but several Government sources said the referendum campaign would not go ahead while delicate Brexit negotiations were ongoing.The referendum, which would, if passed, allow Irish citizens living abroad to vote in presidential elections from 2025, was originally earmarked for a polling date in May – at the same time as the local and European elections – but was then rescheduled for late October or early November.That would have required the legislation to have been published before the summer recess to ensure a Referendum Commission was established sufficiently in advance of polling day.However, in Cabinet meetings during July, several Ministers expressed reservations about the referendum going ahead in the autumn, arguing that it would ert public attention away from Brexit in the run-up to the October 31st deadline.The referendum is likely to encounter a higher degree of opposition than the recent ones on orce and on blasphemy. Some high-profile figures are expected to oppose allowing citizens who do not live in Ireland the right to vote in elections that might not have a direct impact on them.Complex campaignIn February, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil the campaign could turn out to be be complex and if the Government was to succeed with it, it would need to put in a “good campaign”.The 39th Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Elections) Bill was published on September 16th by Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.A fortnight ago the Tánaiste announced the establishment of the Referendum Commission chaired by High Court judge David Barniville.Mr Coveney has said that with the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, that process has been prioritised over choosing a specific date for the referendum.The Bill to amend the Constitution is expected to come before the Dáil during this term. Once passed by parliament and enacted, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will make an order for polling. The referendum must take place 30-90 days after the making of the order.The four by-elections to replace the four former TDs who were elected to the European parliament are scheduled to take place on November 29th. In order for the referendum to take place on that day, the order would need to be made by October 30th.Several sources in Government said on Thursday they thought this highly unlikely and predicted a polling date in spring."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Too early to break out the champagne, but at last it looks like progress is being madePrince William on making his mark on father\u0026#39s Duchy of Cornwall legacy: \u0026#39I’ll never know as much as he does, but I’ll try my best\u0026#39Extinction Rebellion protesters face tougher penalties under new laws being considered by ministersFood crime reports rise to highest level since horse meat scandalDog walkers could be prosecuted if their pets catch squirrels under Labour plans to tighten hunting lawsBoris Johnson opens door to customs compromiseRural way of life is under threat, new Countryside Alliance chairman saysComment: Why I probably won\u0026#39t be getting Brexit for my birthdayVeterans\u0026#39 fury as planned \u0026#39amnesty\u0026#39 for troops facing historic allegations jettisoned from Queen’s SpeechNicola Sturgeon \u0026#39leading SNP into cul-de-sac by rejecting independence referendum alternatives\u0026#39Workers in their 50s more than twice as likely to be made redundant than 40-somethings, official data showsMother of  \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 jihadi mounts new court bid to secure trial of her son in the UKDispatch: Anger on Turkish border as conflict reveals contradiction at the heart of Western Syria policyComment: Brexit Britain can fill the gap left by a retreating TrumpRise in same-sex couples adopting as charity says they are more willing to care for \u0026#39harder to place\u0026#39 childrenOnly six per cent of migrants illegally crossing the Channel have been deported, figures showOusted US ambassador to Ukraine claims Donald Trump pushed for her removalMother of Isil \u0026#39Beatle\u0026#39 makes second legal bid to force trial in UKSudden infant death syndrome down to gene deficiency which prevents milk being digested in some babiesTeenager managed to run two County Lines drug gangs from prisonWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212702237_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRMWbYwzrg_3PLcMwCu9G8U.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"ethiopiasabiy ahmed won nobel peace prize bridge love unorthodox","story":"Abiy Ahmed has ridden roughshod over establishment figures to change EthiopiaThe Nobel Committee’s decision to award its Peace Prize to Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia, marks a return to tradition.Mr Abiy is a peacemaker of the old school.

For goods arriving in those countries by ship, delivery takes even longer, making it harder to sign contracts weeks in advance when it is unclear what tariffs will apply.Pricing has also been difficult, with the pound whipsawing in line with the latest Brexit developments.“Importers and exporters are in limbo, and many are postponing investment decisions, while they await further information,” said Edward Winterton, UK chief executive at Bibby Financial Services.“Many others are focusing resources on ensuring they’re prepared to deal with the potential impacts of a no-deal scenario.”British exports fell sharply in the second quarter to the lowest level in almost three years, according to the latest official data, adjusted for inflation.Although some of the drop was probably caused by a weaker global economy, academic research published in December 2018 also identified a Brexit effect. The researchers found that since the EU referendum, growth in British exports had been much slower than it would have been had the vote never taken place. The trend is “clear and consistent” for exports both to EU and non-EU countries, they wrote.Much of the uncertainty cited by UK exporters has to do with the repeated delays to Brexit, but even once Britain leaves the EU, questions about future trade relationships will remain. For example, the UK will have to negotiate its own trade deals with countries where it currently has one via its EU membership, such as Japan and Canada, and that will take time.The BCC surveyed 1,140 internationally active businesses between 10 and 30 July.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For goods arriving in those countries by ship, delivery takes even longer, making it harder to sign contracts weeks in advance when it is unclear what tariffs will apply.Pricing has also been difficult, with the pound whipsawing in line with the latest Brexit developments.“Importers and exporters are in limbo, and many are postponing investment decisions, while they await further information,” said Edward Winterton, UK chief executive at Bibby Financial Services.“Many others are focusing resources on ensuring they’re prepared to deal with the potential impacts of a no-deal scenario.”British exports fell sharply in the second quarter to the lowest level in almost three years, according to the latest official data, adjusted for inflation.Although some of the drop was probably caused by a weaker global economy, academic research published in December 2018 also identified a Brexit effect. The researchers found that since the EU referendum, growth in British exports had been much slower than it would have been had the vote never taken place. The trend is “clear and consistent” for exports both to EU and non-EU countries, they wrote.Much of the uncertainty cited by UK exporters has to do with the repeated delays to Brexit, but even once Britain leaves the EU, questions about future trade relationships will remain. For example, the UK will have to negotiate its own trade deals with countries where it currently has one via its EU membership, such as Japan and Canada, and that will take time.The BCC surveyed 1,140 internationally active businesses between 10 and 30 July.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The store stocks more than 100,000 LPs and CDs, and it is the first retailer to offer every film available in\u0026nbsp4K UHD, which amounts to 20,000 Blu-ray and more than\u0026nbsp40,000 DVD titles.The\u0026nbspVault, located close to the city centre, also features a performance space designed for concerts by international and local musicians. Liam Payne will perform at the store’s launch on Friday, followed by James Arthur on Saturday. The Murder Capital and local bands will play over the opening weekend.“I am a firm believer in the potential for British high street retail,” said Doug Putman, owner of HMV.“Retail offers two things a purely digital experience of music simply can’t – the opportunity to experience the biggest acts live in our stores and our ability to offer a platform to new artists in the communities where we operate, as well as opportunities for fans to come together and share their passion for music and film with our dedicated staff.”Created with Sketch.

At the time, it blamed a continued decline in the CD and DVD market, as well as “extremely weak Christmas footfall”.

“realistic”.However, he also said he has heard “optimistic messages” that a Brexit deal can be reached.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, said sterling’s rally over the last two days was “astonishing” but the ride is not yet over.“Now that negotiations are in the tunnel phase, we should anticipate a lot less news flow but there will be just as much speculation as ever,” he said.“Of course, this rally is built on shaky foundations and is susceptible to a crash if the negotiations don’t produce a deal for MPs to vote on.”Stocks also rose around the world on the back of speculation that the US and China may be closer to reaching a trade deal after 15 months of damaging rhetoric and tariff rises.Markets in the US, Japan, the UK, Germany and France all posted strong

Many multinational firms earn revenues in other currencies before converting them into sterling, which means their bottom lines are given a foreign exchange boost when the pound is weak.The more domestically focused FTSE 250 soared more than 3 per cent in response to the positive noises emanating from Brussels.A UK government spokesperson and an EU Commission spokesperson both separately described the morning’s meeting as “constructive”, as did Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator.“Brexit is like climbing a mountain,” Mr Barnier said. “We need vigilance, determination and patience.”A European Commission spokesperson said: “The EU and UK have agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days.\u0026nbsp“The EU’s position remains the same: there must be a legally operative solution in the withdrawal agreement that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, protects the all-island economy and the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement in all its dimensions, and safeguards the integrity of the single market.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing.

The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.Elio goes on to reveal that he’s had few relationships since Oliver and that all were short-lived.“Maybe because I never really let go or lose myself with others,” he tells Michel. “After an instant of passion, I always fall back to being the autonomous me.”The excerpt also reveals that Oliver is now a teacher in the US, his native country, and acknowledges his marriage to a woman. His engagement is a major plot point in\u0026nbspCall Me By Your Name.“We haven’t spoken in ages, and I don’t know that we’re friends, though I’m sure we will always be,” Elio says of Oliver.“He’s always read me extremely well, and I have a feeling that he suspects that if I never write it’s not because I don’t care but because a part of me still does and always will, just as I know he still cares, which is why he too never writes. And knowing this is good enough for me.”Find Me\u0026nbspwill be released on 29 October.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was seen churning out its first ever stars: supermassive objects that are only at the very beginning of their lives.“It’s this little blue smudge, meaning it’s a very small galaxy that contains a lot of super-hot, very massive young stars that formed recently,” says Matthew\u0026nbspBayliss, a research scientist in\u0026nbspMIT’s\u0026nbspKavli\u0026nbspInstitute for Astrophysics and Space Research. “This galaxy is similar to the very first galaxies that formed in the universe … the kind of which no one has ever seen in X-ray in the distant universe before.”Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberScientists now hope they can use the same technique to see other extreme and energetic events so far away that they happened right at the very beginning of the universe.“With this technique, we could, in the future, zoom in on a distant galaxy and age-date different parts of it –\u0026nbspto say, this part has stars that formed 200 million years ago, versus another part that formed 50 million years ago, and pick them apart in a way you cannot otherwise do,” said\u0026nbspBayliss.Nasa releases ‘peculiar’ recordings from surface of MarsThe technique relies on one of the strangest characteristics of such huge galaxy clusters: they are the most massive objects in the universe, so huge and powerful that they distort the very fabric of space-time. As they do, the universe and its light is bent.That can be used something like a magnifying glass, because of a phenomenon known as\u0026nbspgravitational lensing. Using complex processing, scientists can examine the light and use it to see magnified images.Researchers have been able to use this before to study objects at optical wavelengths. But the new research is a breakthrough because they have never before usedit to examine the X-ray band of the\u0026nbspelectromagnetic spectrum, which is so difficult that some thought it might be impossible.“If you’re trying to see an X-ray source behind a cluster, it’s like trying to see a candle next to a really bright light, said\u0026nbspBayliss. “So we knew this was a challenging measurement to make.”To get around that problem, researchers used Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspChandra\u0026nbspX-ray Observatory, one of the most powerful X-ray telescopes in the world. With that, they were able to start looking deeper and deeper into the universe – including at such infant galaxies.“We’re catching this galaxy at a very useful stage, where it’s got these really young stars,”\u0026nbspBayliss\u0026nbspsays. “Every galaxy had to start out in this phase, but we don’t see a lot of these kinds of galaxies in our own\u0026nbspneighborhood. Now we can go back in time, look in the distant universe, find galaxies in this early phase of their life, and start to study how star formation is different there.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former Google chair\u0026nbspEric Schmidt was questioned in 2014 about Google supporting a climate change-denying pressure group, to which he responded that it was “some sort of mistake”.He told the radio host who questioned him about it that Google “should not be aligned with such people” and said that it wouldn’t happen again.But the company continues to provide financial backing to controversial groups, with a spokesperson telling : “We’re hardly alone among companies that contribute to organisations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy.”In September, Google employees joined workers from other tech firms in a mass walkout to support the Global Climate Strike.\u0026nbspIn a blog post at the time, the Google Workers for Action on Climate group highlighted some of the deals and funding that the company was involved with that contradicted its public stance on climate change.Need another reason to support a four day week? Climate change“Google Cloud makes significant revenue licensing infrastructure, machine learning,\u0026nbspand engineering talent to fossil fuel companies, promising to help them extract fuel reserves faster,” the post stated.\u0026nbsp“Also, Google invests in the deadly status quo. In 2018 the company funded 111 members of congress who voted against climate legislation at least 90 per cent of the time.”Ahead of the worker strike, Google announced “the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history”, which included 18 new energy deals that will increase its portfolio of wind and solar agreements by 40 per cent.The workers group hopes Google will go further than this by ending all contracts with fossil fuel companies and eliminating\u0026nbspfunding for climate-denying lobbyists and politicians.“As iniduals, we may feel alone in facing climate change,” the group stated. “But if we act together – if we act now – we can build a better future.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By sharing details of the phone, the technology giant was attempting to take back the narrative from the leakers, gossips and rumour merchants that fill the pages of the tech press in the build-up to a major product launch.But the limited amount of information imparted only seemed to serve as bait, with publications picking apart each picture\u0026nbspto determine what hardware features to expect. Along with dual-rear cameras, the images also revealed an additional sensor that became noticeable when the contrast of one image was adjusted.Moreover, Google\u0027s revelations didn\u0027t prevent the usual slew of rumours, with Google and its production partners seemingly more leaky than dear Liza\u0027s bucket.The official unveiling of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will take place on 15 October at an event in New York City, but with little left to announce it will likely be almost entirely ceremonial. For those not keen on sitting through a two hour presentation, The Independent\u0026nbsphas a run down of everything that\u0027s expected to be announced.As with most smartphone makers this year, the main upgrade for Google\u0027s latest device will almost certainly be the camera.Both the front- and rear-facing cameras will see considerable improvements, with an additional 16-megapixel telephoto lens at the back being complimented by complex sensors at the front that will enable the same depth-aware facial recognition that is featured on the latest\u0026nbspiPhones.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

A camera block at the back is reminiscent of the iPhone 11\u0027s setup and houses both lenses and sensors.Leaked photos also seem to show that there is no longer a fingerprint reader on the rear of the device, though this may still be featured beneath the screen itself.There will three colours for the Pixel 4: \u0027just black\u0027, \u0027clearly white\u0027 and \u0027oh so orange\u0027. There may also be a \u0027mint green\u0027 version of the phone, though this is not certain.Android 10 and a 5G versionGoogle\u0027s latest mobile operating system was announced in August,\u0026nbsprevealing a complete overhaul to the world\u0027s most popular software. As always, Google\u0027s own devices were the first to include Android 10 and so there is no doubt it will appear on the two new Pixel 4 phones.One of the most highly-anticipated features of Android 10 is Live Caption, which uses artificial intelligence to automatically transcribe speech from audio or videos playing on the phone.AFPGetty Images)Whilst fundamentally an accessibility feature, allowing deaf and hard-of-hearing users to better consume content, it will also be a perk to anyone hoping to surreptitiously watch videos without disturbing those around them.Google is also reportedly working on a 5G version of the Pixel 4, according to Nikkei Asian Review, which would see the tech giant beat its old foe Apple to releasing a next-generation device.Release date and priceWhile the date of the announcement is already known, it is not clear yet when the phones will actually be released. If past Pixel cycles are anything to go by, pre-orders will open the day of the unveiling, with the release date coming before the end of the month.Last year, the Pixel 3 was revealed on 9 October and released nine days later on 18 October.No amount of leaks have given a certain indication of the exact price of the new phones, though listings discovered by 9to5Google\u0026nbspsuggest the Pixel 4 will cost 820 euros (£727) and the Pixel 4 XL will be 1,127 euros (£999).Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The store stocks more than 100,000 LPs and CDs, and it is the first retailer to offer every film available in\u0026nbsp4K UHD, which amounts to 20,000 Blu-ray and more than\u0026nbsp40,000 DVD titles.The\u0026nbspVault, located close to the city centre, also features a performance space designed for concerts by international and local musicians. Liam Payne will perform at the store’s launch on Friday, followed by James Arthur on Saturday. The Murder Capital and local bands will play over the opening weekend.“I am a firm believer in the potential for British high street retail,” said Doug Putman, owner of HMV.“Retail offers two things a purely digital experience of music simply can’t – the opportunity to experience the biggest acts live in our stores and our ability to offer a platform to new artists in the communities where we operate, as well as opportunities for fans to come together and share their passion for music and film with our dedicated staff.”Created with Sketch.

The staff will also be able to advise customers on music technology, ranging from turntables to headphones, sold in store, HMV said. Another offering is a range of 7,000 music-related books and music-inspired fashion and merchandise.In its announcement, HMV cited research showing that every age group in the UK buys more CDs and LPs than the global average.The firm was bought by Mr Putman, owner of Canadian chain Sunrise Records, in February after it collapsed for the second time in December. At the time, it blamed a continued decline in the CD and DVD market, as well as “extremely weak Christmas footfall”. The deal saved almost 1,500 out of 2,200 jobs.The one-time high street stalwart originally went into administration in 2013 amid\u0026nbsprising competition from music streaming services. It was then bought by Hilco, a firm specialising in restructuring.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tip. Sweetie. We have a whole list for you.”She added, “The tea I could spill on what bulls*** this is but at the end of the day I think people can see it’s clear he’s salty.Created with Sketch.The 35 best debut albums of all time Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.“He’s a huge misogynist and has never been able to have a conversation with any woman in which he doesn’t speak like a fortune cookie.”Azalea, whose rise to short-lived chart ubiquity was marked by controversy over cultural appropriation and the Australian star’s use of African-American Vernacular English in her raps, was previously signed to T.I.’s Grand Hustle record label. T.I. also produced and co-wrote a number of Azalea’s early hits.Iggy Azalea responds to cultural appropriation accusationsIggy Azalea says she feels ‘violated’ following topless photo leakThe pair went their separate ways in 2015, with T.I. telling a New York radio station that Azalea’s Twitter interaction with rapper Q-Tip was partly to blame.Q-Tip had taken to Twitter to offer Azalea insight into the history of hip hop and its intersection with race and politics. In response, Azalea wrote: “I’m… not going to sit on Twitter and play hip-hop squares with strangers to somehow prove I deserve to be a fan of or influenced by hip hop.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I tried, you know? But that’s not cinema,” he said.“Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.“It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.”Created with Sketch.Best films of 2019 (so far) Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab341 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1641 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who’ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.Perhaps The Flood isn’t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.Ari Aster\u0027s follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it’s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It’s also bound to be one of this year’s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it’s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.3241 Varda by Agnès  For a film that’s almost entirely narrated by Agnès Varda\u0027s own voice, it doesn’t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You’ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.3441 Blinded by the LightBlinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen’s lyrical genius, but of how he’s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.Lined up against some of this year’s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. Hustlers is an electrifying response to the deluge of stories we’ve had over the years about very rich, very bad dudes. Finally, we can turn the tables on every film that’s used women, specifically strippers, as decorative accessories to drape over businessmen as they conduct their illicit backroom meetings. Or, failing that, to shake their out-of-focus tits in the background of a shot.For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It’s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors.The real drama here is not whether or not apocalypse can be avoided but whether Brad Pitt’s character can reconcile himself with his father and overcome his own extreme emotional repression. In other words, in spite of all the jargon and the hardware, this is an intimate family melodrama at heart. Thanks to Pitt’s performance and Gray’s delicate direction, it turns into a very moving one.Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it’s one of the best films of the year.This is Renée Zellweger’s Judy. It doesn’t belong to Rupert Goold, its director. Nor does it belong to Tom Edge, its screenwriter. It’s a performance of such overwhelming force that it wrests authorship from every other hand that guided the film’s creation.4141 Ready or NotAs absurd and self-indulgent as Ready or Not can get, it doesn’t mess around with its social commentary. The class system is the game we never asked to play, don’t get a fair chance at, and have no hope of winning. It’s a timeless metaphor.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move.

It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who’ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.Perhaps The Flood isn’t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.Ari Aster\u0027s follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it’s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It’s also bound to be one of this year’s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it’s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.3241 Varda by Agnès  For a film that’s almost entirely narrated by Agnès Varda\u0027s own voice, it doesn’t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You’ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.3441 Blinded by the LightBlinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen’s lyrical genius, but of how he’s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.Lined up against some of this year’s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. Hustlers is an electrifying response to the deluge of stories we’ve had over the years about very rich, very bad dudes. Finally, we can turn the tables on every film that’s used women, specifically strippers, as decorative accessories to drape over businessmen as they conduct their illicit backroom meetings. Or, failing that, to shake their out-of-focus tits in the background of a shot.For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It’s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors.The real drama here is not whether or not apocalypse can be avoided but whether Brad Pitt’s character can reconcile himself with his father and overcome his own extreme emotional repression. In other words, in spite of all the jargon and the hardware, this is an intimate family melodrama at heart. Thanks to Pitt’s performance and Gray’s delicate direction, it turns into a very moving one.Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it’s one of the best films of the year.This is Renée Zellweger’s Judy. It doesn’t belong to Rupert Goold, its director. Nor does it belong to Tom Edge, its screenwriter. It’s a performance of such overwhelming force that it wrests authorship from every other hand that guided the film’s creation.4141 Ready or NotAs absurd and self-indulgent as Ready or Not can get, it doesn’t mess around with its social commentary. The class system is the game we never asked to play, don’t get a fair chance at, and have no hope of winning. It’s a timeless metaphor.Scorsese is currently preparing for the release of his longest film ever, The Irishman, a crime film starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.A new trailer for the film gave a closer look at how de-aging techniques were used to give its leads appear younger.The Irishman\u0026nbspwill be released on Netflix on 27 November and will air in select cinemas on 1 November.Marvel, meanwhile, has begun teasing out its Phase Four after wrapping up the Infinity Saga with\u0026nbspAvengers: Endgame\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspSpider-Man: Far From Home.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

“realistic”.However, he also said he has heard “optimistic messages” that a Brexit deal can be reached.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, said sterling’s rally over the last two days was “astonishing” but the ride is not yet over.“Now that negotiations are in the tunnel phase, we should anticipate a lot less news flow but there will be just as much speculation as ever,” he said.“Of course, this rally is built on shaky foundations and is susceptible to a crash if the negotiations don’t produce a deal for MPs to vote on.”Stocks also rose around the world on the back of speculation that the US and China may be closer to reaching a trade deal after 15 months of damaging rhetoric and tariff rises.Markets in the US, Japan, the UK, Germany and France all posted strong

Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the old days. I will be meeting with the vice premier today.

Many multinational firms earn revenues in other currencies before converting them into sterling, which means their bottom lines are given a foreign exchange boost when the pound is weak.The more domestically focused FTSE 250 soared more than 3 per cent in response to the positive noises emanating from Brussels.A UK government spokesperson and an EU Commission spokesperson both separately described the morning’s meeting as “constructive”, as did Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator.“Brexit is like climbing a mountain,” Mr Barnier said. “We need vigilance, determination and patience.”A European Commission spokesperson said: “The EU and UK have agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days.\u0026nbsp“The EU’s position remains the same: there must be a legally operative solution in the withdrawal agreement that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, protects the all-island economy and the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement in all its dimensions, and safeguards the integrity of the single market.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What we’d do is as the tradition, which is have an election for a new leader.”Speaking to Alastair Campbell, in an interview for GQ magazine, he also said: “I think it is the same for my own personal position.”Mr McDonnell also insisted he backed Mr Corbyn’s determination to fight an election before a fresh Brexit referendum is held – but admitted a Final Say referendum could yet come first.Created with Sketch.Brexit and climate protests at Labour party conference: In pictures Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn walks past anti-Brexit campaigner on the second day of the party conference in BrightonA protester holds a sign mocking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Brexit stance at the party conference in BrightonActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightonDelegates take part in an informal vote on Labour\u0027s Brexitr stance at the party conference in BrightonShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry leads a march in support of a second referendum on BrexitAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonExtinction RebelliActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightononExtinction Rebellion activists march on the Labour conference in BrightonA delegate arrives carrying a briefing from the Labour Representation Committee to the Labour party conference in BrightonProminent anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray protests on Brighton beach during the Labour party conferenceAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonActivists raise a banner calling for the Labour party to restore the original Clause 4 of its constitution, which would pledge the party to nationalising all industryLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn walks past anti-Brexit campaigner on the second day of the party conference in BrightonA protester holds a sign mocking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Brexit stance at the party conference in BrightonActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightonDelegates take part in an informal vote on Labour\u0027s Brexitr stance at the party conference in BrightonShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry leads a march in support of a second referendum on BrexitAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonExtinction RebelliActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightononExtinction Rebellion activists march on the Labour conference in BrightonA delegate arrives carrying a briefing from the Labour Representation Committee to the Labour party conference in BrightonProminent anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray protests on Brighton beach during the Labour party conferenceAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonActivists raise a banner calling for the Labour party to restore the original Clause 4 of its constitution, which would pledge the party to nationalising all industry“Within parliament itself there is a large number of people who are saying we’d rather have a referendum attached to any deal,” he acknowledged.And he added: “Once we get to the stage of blocking no deal, a general election is on the table.

Pride and Prejudice, then, sees her at the peak of her powers. Through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet, her sharp-witted protagonist, we witness upper-class Regency England as both a dream and a farce. Not all is as it seems, and society betrays its holloweness when it deems that money should trump love. Despite the fact that Hurston was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, Their Eyes Were Watching God was largely rejected by her peers. It was during the 1970s and 1980s that her novel was essentially rediscovered, with many contemporary black feminists heralding the genius of her work. The novel focuses on Janie Crawford, a black woman who refuses to give in to bitterness or sorrow, as she navigates three marriages and a life marked by poverty. It’s a story bursting with passion and soulfulness. 325 The Lottery and Other Stories – Shirley Jackson Jackson probed the darkest corners of the American psyche during the 1940s and 1950s, all thanks to her collections of ghost stories, including 1959’s The Haunting of Hill House, which was recently adapted into a Netflix series. With several novels and over 200 short stories for readers to get lost in, there are very few horror writers like her. That’s especially true when it comes to (arguably) her greatest work, 1948’s The Lottery, which traces a small town’s annual tradition to its sinister conclusion. A Pulitzer Prize winner, To Kill a Mockingbird has carved its place in history. Its depiction of racial injustice in the American Deep South was startling frank for the 1960s, in a way that undeniably had a social impact at the time – it became an instant sensation and is now widely taught in American schools. Lee writes about the world’s cruelties with an honesty and compassion that still resonates, with the character of Atticus Finch becoming a enduring model of integrity for the legal profession. Butler was a key figure in sci-fi history, expanding the boundaries of what the genre could achieve and what it could come to represent. First published in 1979, the book still feels as fresh as ever in its first-person account of a young black writer, Dana, who through strange circumstances, finds herself travelling between her own reality and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. It’s through this unusual theme that Butler can explore the lasting trauma of America’s history on African-Americans today. Jane Eyre feels, in many ways, thoroughly modern today. Although originally published under the pen name “Currer Bell”, it feels likes a e into the mind of Brontë herself. The story is told through a first-person narrative that feels so psychologically intimate, it’s as if she’s sharing the secrets of her own world with us. We follow Jane through her school years, all the way to her later employment by Mr Rochester, a tortured soul who she falls madly in love with, with many aspects of her journey reflecting elements of Brontë’s own life. 725 Half of a Yellow Sun – Chimamanda Ngozi AdichieAdichie, who was born in Nigeria, is considered one of the most original literary voices of her generation. You can see why this is when reading Half of a Yellow Sun, which depicts the brutality of the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s, as seen through four different perspectives: twin daughters of a wealthy businessman, a British citizen, a professor, and a houseboy. It’s history via an achingly human lens. Smith remains a modern titan of the British literary scene, thanks partially to White Teeth, which is considered one of the most sensational fiction debuts of all time, becoming an immediate bestseller and sweeping up multiple awards. It’s a tale of two men – Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones – who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 925 The Hour of the Star - Clarice LispectorLispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macabéa, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector’s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil. However, the way Rodrigo perceives Macabéa, and reckons with her story, itself creates a dialogue between the two characters, calling into question notions of identity and authorship. One of literature’s sharpest minds and inspiration to the feminist movement in the 1970s, Woolf not only helped pioneer the use of the stream of consciousness as a narrative device, but utilised it to speak openly about sexuality, mental illness, and gender roles. The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 1125 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories – Flannery O’Connor O’Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story’s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi’s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It’s the political seen through the personal, but it’s always Satrapi’s own spirit that shines the brightest. Many have now come to consider Shelley’s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character’s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley’s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It’s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man’s unbridled power. Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter. It’s through this vivid sense of magical realism that Morrison can confront the unfathomable trauma that slavery has inflicted on the African-American collective memory.Although the book has received increased attention thanks to Hulu’s critically acclaimed TV adaptation, it’s all thanks to the fierceness of Atwood’s critical analysis of gender politics. Her 1985 book, which imagines a near-future New England controlled by a totalitarian state, in which women are completely subjugated to men, has only become increasingly relevant – and prescient. Her work provides a continued reminder that it doesn’t take much for our world to slip into complete dystopia. Mary Anne Evans, amongst other concerns, feared that her work, Middlemarch, would be dismissed entirely due to the notion that women’s writing was strictly light and romantic. And so, instead, it was published in eight instalments across 1871 and 1872 under the name George Eliot. The book is far from light set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, it follows a vast, sweeping narrative that encompasses subjects of religion, idealism, and political reform. Ng writes about American suburbia with an astounding clarity, perhaps partially because she considers the act of writing about one’s hometown as a little like “writing about a relative”, with an attachment that perceives both their greatest attributes and their flaws. Little Fires Everywhere is her second novel to take place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she grew up, and focuses on a new arrival to the town, who sense of mystery disrupts its residents’s obsession with structure and rules. Famous for its popularity with teenage girls, Plath’s work speaks to clearly to an adolescent precisely because it makes no attempt to sugar-coat the prospect of the entrance into adulthood. The book’s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women’s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther’s frustration that has been a comfort to many. My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante’s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it’s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 2025 The Age of Innocence – Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York’s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds – in every other way society’s perfect vision of man and woman – find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society’s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker’s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist’s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It’s no wonder that the book’s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn’t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period. In its story of a woman whose whirlwind courtship with a widower turns sour when she becomes haunted by the lingering presence of her husband’s first wife, Rebecca is a book filled with suppressed desires, loss, and a looming sense of threat. 2325 The God of Small Things - Arundhati RoyAs Roy’s debut novel, it’s an extraordinary first outing. Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book’s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins’s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 2425 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha ChristieWe may know every twist and turn of Christie’s best works by now, but there’s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers. Murder on the Orient Express still feels like her most enthralling work, as famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself in the midst of a murder scene, after his train is blocked by the heavy snowfall and a passenger is found dead, making the rest of those on board all instant suspects. 2525 The Tale of Genji – Murasaki ShikibuThe oldest book on this list, this classic of Japanese literature was written by Shikibu, a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, in the early 11th century. Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what’s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it’s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan.125 Pride and Prejudice – Jane AustenAusten remains one of history’s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire.

An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it’s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan.The manuscript has been described as 21.9cm (8.6in) long and 14.3cm (5.6in) wide.No original version of\u0026nbspThe Tale of Genji\u0026nbspis believed to have survived, but other writers have transcribed the story.The newly uncovered manuscript was transcribed by the Japanese poet\u0026nbspFujiwara no Teika, according to experts. Teika’s transcriptions are believed to be the oldest available versions of the novel.Four other chapters also transcribed by Teika have previously been recovered.Current work on the newly discovered chapter was previously done using manuscripts completed two and a half centuries\u0026nbspfollowing Teika’s era,\u0026nbspJunko Yamamoto, a professor at the\u0026nbspKyoto University of Advanced Science, told the\u0026nbspAsahi Shimbun.“It is very significant that this discovery of the manuscript edited by Teika will be available for researchers,” she told the publication.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And hoping to hell she doesn’t suddenly draw Will Carling in that sandpit of hers.Which, mercully, she didn’t. There was just a hospice, a candle and two little heads who were probably William and Harry, but could just as easily have been Wayne Sleep and Simon Le Bon.It passed without major diplomatic incident, though. As did the rest of Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions’ final, where viewers were served up everything from Stavros Flatley and the Ukrainian sandpit woman to Twist And Pulse and the astonishing -year-old German dog dancing girl, Alex Lauenburger, who’s got those mutts of hers drilled like . . . like . . .Well, never mind what she’s got them drilled like. Let’s just say they’ve cocked their little legs all over Pudsey the dog’s grave. There were a couple of failures among the success as well, of course: magician Darcy Oake, who dropped his act in favour of a bereavement story, and American comedian Preacher Lawson.Brilliant, charismatic and funny during the semi-final, Preacher was rushed, confused and barely raised a laugh during the final. Not that any of the judges did him the favour of spelling out the truth. They don’t seem to do that on BGT: The Champions. What they get instead is OTT praise and  hope.Absolutely the oddest thing they did, though, during Saturday’s final, just before Cowell teed up daredevil Bello Nock as “certiably insane”, was getting Ant  Dec to introduce Britain Get Talking, an ITV mental wellness campaign sparked, apparently, by a “ per cent rise in anxiety and depression”.To counter that trend, proceedings were halted and replaced by an awkward silence inside Wembley Arena, so that viewers could communicate with their nearest and dearest, as they probably would’ve done during the following ad break anyway.Opinions on this stunt will, I realise, y wildly. Given there’s no shortage of shows dealing with mental health issues, though, it just looked to me like BGT had jumped on board the virtue-signalling bandwagon.It also flew in the face of light entertainment’s real purpose, to lt the human spirit and remove you from le’s harsh realities for a minute or two.The audience understands thisonly too well, and that’s why Saturday’s top two places were filled by acts who offered no sob stories, just entertainment.Twist And Pulse deservedly won and got the BGT trophy. Stavros Flatley came second, so Deme’s we doesn’t even get that new fridge. What happens to BGT: The Champions next  I’ve no idea and suspect ITV doesn’t either.All we do know for sure, in fact, is the next part of this weird Autumn Cowell trilogy is X Factor: Celebrity, a replacement for the civilian version which was, in part, dragged down by endless audience manipulation and accusations of favouritism.“Megastar” acts on this new show will include Max  Harvey. A new one on me but, lo and behold, turns out they’re managed by Simon Cowell’s mate Tim Byrne, who used to be Creative Director of Syco.ON Friday’s EastEnders Jean Slater said: “I can’t believe they’ve been pretending to like my sausage surprise all these years. It makes me wonder what they think of my fishy basket.”THANKS to Wednesday’s Cape Town jaunt on The Apprentice, I now know there are , shipwrecks off the coast of South Africa, rhinos are not to be confused with elephants and hippos enjoy mating. Even at the age of .Just don’t ask me to name safari’s “big five”, ’cos I’ve watched that episode three times now and my best guess is still lion, rhino, elephant, The Gruffalo and Thomas Skinner, the hulking great Charley Boorman lookalike from Romford, whose nose twitches uncontrollably whenever he’s just said something wrong.“Look, we ain’t a bunch of idiots, are we ” .Thomas, of course, was one of the stand-out performers on a brilliant first episode, along with Ryan-Mark Parsons , Carina Lepore, whose tour of the vineyard sculpture park was a bit wordy for my likingand Lottie Lion, who “worked in the best wine bar in the UK”, and is as fragrant and enticing as a broken bottle of Buckfast.It bodes well for the series, but almost certainly won’t stop the usual axe-grinders complaining “The Apprentice is past its sell-by-date”, even though there are other network fixtures and fittings that fit that description so much better.Andyou want a full and exhaustive list of all those BBC shows which deserve to be sent to the knacker’s yard long before Lord Sugar’s masterpiece, here goes. All of them.BBC, Wednesday, pm, The Apprentice. It does what it says on the tin, yeah.JUST a quick note about the incredibly intense two-minute, -second silence Eamonn Holmes maintained while he stared at the Greek Feast Phil Vickery was making on Friday’s This Morning.Who said the following last week: “There’s bile coming out of her and all this green crap ”A Cat discussing Morag’s stomach upset on Treasure Island with Bear Grylls B Emily Maitlis introducing Greta Thunberg on Newsnight Well I didn’t say it was hard, did I Channel  over-stepping the anti-Boris anti-Brexit line on Friday’s Gogglebox.The BBC appointing the host of Michael Jackson: The Live Seance, June Sarpong, as its new head of “Creative Diversity”.Sky Atlantic expecting us all to pretend Helen Mirren isn’t  years too old to be playing Catherine The Great.Sean Bean’s bus that never bloody moves on World On Fire.And The One Show’s Matt Baker asking: “Comedy, where did that all start, Romesh ”When, Matt. Not where. When does that all start Paul Merson: “This lad’s come in and not let them down once. Although he let them down at Old Trafford.”RICHARD Madeley has left The Circle and, given the impact he had on the Channel  reality show, it would have been understandableall the interest had gone with him. The fact it hasn’t is largely down to the discovery of a brand new television star.He’s Tim, the show’s -year-old theology professor, who, unlike all the millennials in that building hiding their insecurities behind a wall of tattoos and fake identities, is so comfortable in his own skin he works out in the gym wearing a three- piece, while reading a book.It’s an approach that can trip him up, quite literally, on the running machine. No one, least of all the other contestants, should mistake the most sweet-natured man on telly for a fool, though.He has sussed out almost everyone  on The Circle, including catfish Katie Jay, and knows exactly how they will react to his messages before he’s even sent them.I wouldn’t normally advocate a post-reality show career for any of these fame-chasers. But it’s a performance of such charm and wit that Tim deserves the ultimate Channel  accolade. Dictionary Corner.

It was a shining beacon. Somehow it made everyone, regardless of age or background, feel special.The menu was fresh and new. We had never even seen torn basil or dough balls. The restaurants were in cool locations. There was one above a recording studio in London’s Bloomsbury.When I was in Blur, we lived off those pizzas for years. I’d order two margherita pizzas at a go because they were so cheap.So it is sad to hear the chain, a British staple since , with  restaurants here and in Ireland, is struggling under a mountain of debt.Some p of every £. margherita it sells goes directly to paying off interest. That’s before salaries and rent costs.Social media is mourning its possible demise. Jokers quip that when it folds, it should be renamed Calzone Express.Yet the chain is far from alone. Jamie’s Italian had to close  restaurants this year and , staff lost their jobs. Strada has shut a third of its venues. Prezzo and Carluccio’s have undergone restructuring.Pizza, as a business model, is brilliant. It has the same ingredients as a cheese and tomato sandwich but you can charge £ for it.Yet times have changed. Services such as Deliveroo mean we can have our pick of restaurant food in the comfort of our own homes.Pizza Express is still somewhere wonderfully classless and unfussy. You can just as happily take a date there as a family.Its three-course meal deal for little ones is brilliant and the staff are always wonderful with picky children. My we and five kids love it . . . and so do my girlfriends. It has expanded its menu, with low-calorie options and vegan meals. Yet it still suffered a fall of nearly eight per cent in earnings over the first half of this year.Part of the problem is that until quite recently there were very few places you would really want to eat on the high street.Now we are overwhelmed with choice in the “casual dining” market, with everything from Japanese to Thai to Mexican, plus a lot more pizza options.What’s more, Pizza Express is owned by a Chinese private equity company, Hony Capital, which has greedily expanded the number of venues since it took over the chain in . There are branches everywhere now.That expansion has slowed, with just two new restaurants opening in the first half of the year. It is taking a more measured approach.I always felt the restaurants had a lot of personality and charm, as well as serving great food at affordable prices — all things that were hard to get in the brand’s heyday.Founder Peter Boizot probably never imagined how much the market would change. He fell in love with Italian food while working as a tutor in Florence before going to Cambridge University. Pizza was unusual here then.Movie director Mario Zampi opened a pizzeria called Pizza Express in Soho’s Wardour Street, central London in . But his film-star friends, including Sophia Loren, turned their noses up at such “peasant food”. Boizot was undeterred.He took over Zampi’s restaurant, including its £, of debt, shipped in Britain’s first pizza oven from Naples and sold his first square pizza slices for two shillings a pop on March , .His first chef was a Sicilian aged  who made the dough in the front room of the restaurant, so customers could see it taking shape.That led to the idea of the chain’s open kitchens, which were revolutionary. It was also responsible for introducing Peroni beer to the UK, an Italian classic.While you would usually have to stand in other pizzerias, Boizot brought in tables and proper metal cutlery.As an art collector, he wanted a stylish concept and hired Italian designer Enzo Apicella to work with him across  restaurants.He called his empire a “necklace of inidual gems” rather than a chain.His favourite pizza was a quattro formaggiwith chopped basil and extra green peppers.Boizot sold the business for £million in  and Hony Capital bought it  years later for £million, racking up debts now estimated to be £.billion.The annual interest is £million, wiping out its profits. Experts say the high street favourite is not in immediate danger, as it has until  to start paying back large chunks of this debt.We have seen what happens to similar chains before, though. If we don’t want to lose this one, action must be taken.Sadly, it is hard to see how our high street can survive without government incentives. Business rates are high and parking is often a nightmare.If you care about a business, the best way to support it is with your custom.And I reckon dinner out with the family is probably better value now, and tastier too, than ever before.

In the last three-and-a-half years, the opposite has ­occurred.It has been the British people — calm, patient, amazingly good-humoured — who have set the example to the foaming fools of our political class. It has been the elite that has been rioting and generally behaving like hooligans.Has there ever been a wilder time in the corridors of power, here and abroad  In the House of Commons we have had sit-ins and choruses of communism’s Red Flag anthem.Middle-class vegan eco-warriors — few of them seemingly poor enough to have to earn a living — have set up tents in Trafalgar Square and Whitehall and brought traffic chaos to working Londoners.Top civil servants and privy councillors have almost come to blows. And a prince of the realm and his new we have thrown a massive wobbly about their Press coverage, mere days after most newspapers had showered them in positive publicity.The clincher for me was Piers Morgan’s rivetingly bizarre ITV interview this week with Boris Johnson’s ex-crumpetJenner Arcuri.Here was a network breakfast TV show quizzing a dimpled dolly-bird in Los Angeles for the best part of an hour, feverishly trying to find outshe had had nookie with our Prime Minister.Up and down the country, families were trying to get some cornflakes into the kids before school, while listening to a blonde with a dirty laugh fight off persistent questions about whether or not she had been “intimate” with the head of our country’s government.Look, I’m no vicar. I don’t really care about politicians’ sex lives, though I happen to think people are happier — and lawmakers more trustworthy —they obey their wedding vows. I also thought Morgan did pretty well in the interview. But it was just such a vivid demonstration of the cartoon-ishness of our current predicament.Cartoon seems the right word because so much of what has been happening in British public le has been farcical and obvious to the point of caricature. Look at the behaviour of the Commons Speaker, John Bercow. His self-conduct in the chair of the Commons has been so maniacally biased, it really does belong to an episode of The Simpsons.Bercow has screamed abuse at MPs who have dared criticise him. He has ripped up centuries of procedural custom to bend the rules to the advantage of his Remain-backing friends. One of his family cars even sported a “Bollocks to Brexit” sticker.If someone tried to chair a parish council in such a blatantly preachy, lecturing way, they would be fired before the first item of business had been completed. Yet Bercow, who will finally quit his role at the end of this month, is going to walk into a six-figure pension for the rest of his le — and he is only .The recent party conferences saw ripe behaviour from our political class. The Liberal Democrats passed a motion vowing to ignore the result of our country’s largest ever public vote. Er, how is that “democratic” At Labour’s conference, the apparent result of a key vote was overturned on the blatant say-so of one of Comrade Corbyn’s key commissars. They didn’t bother to have any votes at the Tory con­ference — they never do — but we did have the spectacle of a parliamentary knight of the shires being kicked out of the premises after an alleged contretemps with a doorkeeper.And you should have seen the amount of booze being put away at those party conferences and at the TUC’s shindig a week earlier. Great lakes of alcohol were gulped down, much of it free. This from the same political class that loves to lecture the rest of us about watching our weekly units.Things are not much better where in our body politic. Top judge Lady Hale has been revelling in her notoriety after she and her fellow Supreme Court judges changed the law and thus made Brexit less likely.Judges once kept themselves away from the media fray. Hale, making jokes at Boris Johnson’s expense and giving quite unnecessary self-promotional interviews, has looked swollen-headed and has done nothing to allay fears the judiciary is as bent as Bercow.The police’s reputation is also in the mire after the mishandling of some plainly absurd sex-abuse allegations. The only other person who believed them was Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who is now bleating about the dangers of a No-Deal Brexit.Why should we believe a single word he says  Talking of the police, why are the Met so timid about stopping the Extinction Rebellion protests in London  You can bet thatthose protestors had been massing in favour of a No-Deal Brexit, they’d have been baton-charged and loaded into the back of a Black Maria. And the public’s response to all this  You have, ladies and gentlemen, been magnicent.You have not rioted. You have not risen up in fury. You have found it hard to stomach, I know, but you have kept your humour. You have stayed loyal to democracy, voting in the European elections we were never meant to have.Opinion polls suggest that Euroscepticism is only growing, with more now wanting a No-Deal Brexit than not.You have, in short, shown the poise and maturity we once expected from our political masters.

Some wait three weeks to be seen.One GP said: “Although I have previously opposed this, I now genuinely think that people don’t value healthcare services.“We get numerous did not attends, as do the hospital.“Charging p for a carrier bag has reduced the number of unnecessary carrier bags as people think twice.“A nominal fee that makes people think about whether an appointment is genuinely needed orthey can access appropriate information in an alternate way might improve unnecessary workload.”Another said: “I cannot think of any other way of stemming increasing and unreasonable demand other than some form of financial barrier.”And a third called for “a small, nominal fee that can be claimed backon low income”.They added: “It would make people realise primary care is a privilege and not unlimited, while not restricting access for those who need it.”But others cautioned against the move, saying: “We already charge people for their NHS care, through taxes.“To charge again would be appalling. The poorest would get sicker.”A doctor’s appointment typically costs the NHS around £ but operations and drugs can cost tens of thousands of pounds extra.Lucy Watson, from the Patients Association, said: “Charging patients for GP appointments would unequivocally be a backward step for the NHS.“It would certainly lead to some patients needlessly suffering harm by not accessing GP care when they need it, because of fear of the cost.“At the same time, up-front charges encourage wealthier people to treat healthcare as a consumer good and spend more on it.”Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, from the Royal College of GPs, said practices need more doctors and funding – but not from fees.She added: “Even a nominal charge for a GP appointment would undoubtedly deter many people from seeking medical help.“General practice is under intense resource and workforce pressures but charging our patients for appointments is not the solution.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Israel has long regarded Iran, and its proxies in the region, armed with missiles and drones, as a massive threat.And Saudi Arabia has been embroiled in neighbouring Yemens civil war since , which has been seen as a proxy for the regions power struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shia Iran.Weeks ago, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarid warned of all-out-warthe US or Saudi Arabia conducted military air strikes against his country.No one has claimed responsibility for todays alleged assault.Fars news agency said: Technical experts believe the incident may be due to terrorist activity.Iranian state TV has also reported that two missiles hit the vessel and damaged two storerooms.All crew members have been reported as unharmed, Irans Nour news agency said on Friday.None of the crew members were injured in the explosion... the situation is under control, the news agency, close to Irans elite Revolutionary Guards Corps, reported.The stricken tanker is believed to be the Sabiti, according to a NIOC statement.That vessel last turned on its tracking devices in August near the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas.To avoid detection, Iranian tankers routinely turn off their trackers because US sanctions target the sale of Irans crude oil.Persian language news network Iran International tweeted that Irans National Petroleum Company said that there were two explosions on an Iranian oil tanker in the Red Sea, which was probably blasted by rocket fire near the Saudi Arabian port of Jeddah.The US Navys Fth Fleet said it was aware of reports about the tanker blast but has no further information so far, a spokesman told Reuters.Oil prices rose two per cent after the Iranian oil tanker explosion, on the back of supply concerns.The alleged attack is the latest incident involving oil tankers in the Red Sea and Gulf region.It comes after America claimed in September that Iran attacked oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz - which Tehran denies.US President Donald Trump warned that America was locked and loaded shortly after that assault.Relations in the region began to worsen signicantly when Trump pulled out of a  nuclear deal between Iran and six powers and reimposed reimposed harsh sanctions to stle its economy.Friction is already high in the Red Sea shipping area, which links the Indian Ocean with the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal.Anger in the Persian Gulf between the United States and Iran has been threatening to reach boiling point.And this has resulted in a massive American military build-up in response to what it says are Iranian threats.In June, the US claimed Iran was behind the torpedo attack on an American-linked oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman.Both the Front Altair and the Panama-flagged Kokuka Courageous - which was reportedly bombed - burst into flames and were forced to evacuate in the troubled region.However, a senior Iranian official told the BBC: Iran has no connection with the incident.And the hardline Islamic nation also described claims it was to blame as Iranophobic.There was also a missile attack on an airport in Saudi Arabia in June, which left dozens dead.Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen said they carried out the aerial assault on Abha airport.The Houthi said it was in response to Saudis continued aggression.At that time, the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Iran-backed rebels promised to respond to what they said was a war crime carried out with advanced weapons supplied by Tehran.Saudi Arabia has been embroiled in neighbouring Yemens civil war since .The war has been seen as a proxy for the region power struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shia Iran.In September, leaked documents revealed that Iran could be blitzed by the US in a colossal shock and awe attack.Codenamed Theatre Iran Near Term , the war plan is believed to be the blueprint for a strike that would pave the war for crushing the countrys powerbase within  hours.A war on Iran has been on the drawing board on the Pentagon for more than ten years.But with rising fears of an imminent conflict after Terran’s missile and drone strike on Saudi oil plant, the leaked plans have re-emerged and are viewed by experts as showing how a US attack would unfold.Almost certainly Iran’s nuclear plants and facilities would be destroyed first.Under TIRANNT, cruise missiles would be unleashed from ships in the Gulf and bombs dropped from formations of B Stratofortress as well as B stealth warplanesMore than , targets would be pummelled.May  - Four ships, including two Saudi oil tankers, are attacked in the Gulf just outside the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route.American officials pin the blame on Iran, a charge Tehran denies.May  -

You need vigilance, determination and patience.This afternoon Boris Johnson has said theres the pathway to a Brexit agreement but insisted its not a done deal yet.The PM insisted that the whole of the UK would be able to take advantage of Brexit.Boris told the media during a school visit this afternoon: Where Leo Varadkar and I got to yesterday was a joint feeling that there is a way forward.We can see the pathway to a deal.That doesnt mean its a done deal, so there is work to be done.The PM also revealed that under no circumstances will we see anything which damages the ability of the whole UK to take advantage of Brexit.This would mean anything which prevents the whole UK from being able to do trade deals would be effectively off the table.But he refused twice to say that Northern Ireland would leave the EUs customs union, which could see the province tied to the bloc for years to come.Yet the details of talks has remained a complete secret so far.As the Brexit endgame entered a critical phase:The major ides are said to be over which customs territory Northern Ireland would stay ina Brexit trade deal wasnt agreed, and over the issue of consent from both the North and Republic about which rules would be followed.Both sides have refused so far to go into any detail on what concessions -any - have been offered.Irish sources claimed the PM had shted ground “signicantly” on the key impasse area of customs.One idea could see Northern Ireland stay in both the EUs customs territory and the UKs, a so-called customs partnership.The DUPs Arlene Foster today insisted that the UK must leave as one nation with no barriers to trade and democratic consent was required where Northern Ireland would allign with the EU.But she added that the party had recognised the need to be flexible and look and Northern Ireland specic solutions too.But Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith gave a hint that they could have moved on the issue of consent for Northern Ireland.Dublin was concerned that the DUP could have a veto over future arrangements.He told BBC Northern Ireland last night: What Im committing to is that we are not going to have one party having a veto over any element of this situation.The idea of a referendum on the terms of customs has been floated to decide.He described the talks as positive and stressed that there was now the distinct possibility of a deal.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the pathway to a deal was on the cards and insisted Boris promise to leave on October  no matter what had focused minds.Former Irish Ambassador to the U.K. Bobby McDonagh told the BBC this morning: We can be a lot more optimistic than we were a few days ago.And Tory MP Nigel Evans added: The happy couple photographed in the papers have clearly been negotiating very seriously.We will have a look at the detail.

But as we enter the last  days of political panic before a theoretical Brexit deadline, it is worth ing to what he said on the topic of general elections and a Peopleaposs Vote. It was widely reported as him telling Jeremy Corbyn an election was an elephant trap that would deliver a comfortable Tory majority.He also said that Boris Johnson knows thatno-deal Brexit stands on its own as a proposition, it might well fail. Buthe mixes up the Brexit question with the Corbyn question in a general election, he could succeed.The Tories are ready for a No Surrender election Labour is under pressure to pick a date as soon as possible after an extension the Lib Dems are champing at the bit and the SNP would quite like a vote before next year, when their former leader Alex Salmond is due in court to answer charges of multiple sexual assault and rape. But hereaposs the thing. Despite defections, splits and ad hoc alliances, Johnson could succeed in ripping us out of the EU without any anaesthetic with the backing of just % of votes cast.   It breaks down like this..million people voted in the  Brexit referendum. They broke - in favour of Leaving the EU. Polls have found, with the deaths of older voters and addition of younger ones to the electoral roll, and a sizeable amount of buyersapos remorse among Leavers, a re-run of that vote today would break - in favour of Remaining. Evenno-one who voted last time changed their minds, YouGov calculates that Remain is gaining about , voters a year while Leave loses about ,. The annual swing of around , is enough, three years on, to put Remain ahead. There is every reason to expect a high turnout among Remainers, students and young people who have never voted before, and a lower showing among Leavers who are disenchanted with the way their vote went last time. No Brexit zealot wants a second referendum. And the Prime Minister knows it would be the end for him. But a general election can be won with smaller numbers. EspeciallyJohnson campaigns for No Deal.Three quarters of Leave voters back leaving without a deal, or arenapost bothered about it. The same proportion of Remain voters are agin it. There are a number of floating Labour Leavers who could be mopped up in the north and coastal constituencies, and surveys show that overall about % of voters support No Deal. In , Blair won  seats with .% of the vote. Just .m votes got him a Parliamentary majority of .If Johnson campaigned for No Deal, heaposd lose a dozen of his own MPs but aim to replace them with more Brexity seats. The small numbers he could command would never be enough to win a binary referendum, but could deliver him a Parliamentary mandate.    The only people whose interests are served by such a Tory election are Johnson, his bunkered, bonkers aposstrategistapos Dominic Cummings, and the currency speculators who will pocket a profit from a plummeting pound. They will cash out, while Johnson prepares for  years of doing whatever the hell he wants. Leavers will lose. They will lose the narrow mandate they had in  they will lose the moral high ground they will lose the argument that this was all going to be easy. But the damage that was done to democracy by giving them a vote for an idea no-one was able to deliver will never be reversed. They will stilll be angry and defensive.Remainers will lose. They will lose their best hope of reversing, slowing or sanitising Brexit. They too will lose hope in the democracy they put their faith in. The calm, middle-class marches, the Proms flag protests, will be replaced by a fresh generation of voters who decide the system is broken.We all lose. However you vote, whatever party you back, wherever you are on Brexit, youaposll despair. A country that has been ided will not, and cannot, be united by a general election about Brexit.    The problem is partly maths - % wins no arguments, but it can mint a government. But itaposs mainly that in a referendum you have two opposing choices, and in a general election each voter has half a dozen.Whoever you choose, they have to also be chosen by % of , of your neighbours, and those choices also need to be in a party which wins the argument in  other constituencies, to contribute to forming a government with a simple majority. If you plan to vote Lib Dem because of their pledge to revoke Article , youaposll need around m people to not only agree with you but to be geographically in the right places to have an impact. If you plan to vote for a Labour Brexit renegotiation, you face the same maths. Butyou want to vote Tory for a no deal, you merely need m or so votes. It destroys the Brexit Party and slays the zombie Nigel Farage. The other voters split between Labour, Lib Dems, and the % of people who could vote but never do. With those abstentions, he needs just a quarter of votes cast. A reminder: getting about -m votes for a thing that previously won .m is not a win. But yet, it is enough to win the keys to Number .  If a third of people donapost vote, a third of people want to revoke, and a third want no deal, that leaves just % of people to make a decision on behalf of all of us. A decision about a government whose members complained about £m spent on a Brexit leaflet they derided as Project Fear and are now spending £m in loose change on telling us that Project Fear is about to become reality.A decision about a Prime Minister who led a team boasting of sunlit uplands, the easiest trade deal in history, and who said we didnapost need to plan for no deal, because weaposre going to get a great deal. A promised bonfire of regulations has turned into a spaghetti of extra red tape, taking back control of our borders has morphed into promising never to control the one border we have, and business has been so thoroughly f***ed by  years of chicanery that the economy is heading into recession.Whatever you think about Brexit, it is the most important constitutional and economic change of our letimes. The one we are faced with is not the one we were sold. Boris Johnsonaposs only way out of it is a general election in which losing the argument, and m votes, doesnapost actually matter. It should matter. It MUST matter.  Blair is derided by many as heartless. With massive majorities, he became a Parliamentary tyrant.

The footage taken from a camera at the front of a property in a residential street, captures a large group of youths in a Bristol street. One hooded figure drags the YoBike - a bike hire company which operates in the South West city - and cycles into the street with one hand before dodging the motorbike as it rides straight over it. Michael Rice, , was not wearing a helmet as he sped down the road in the Hartclfe estate in April this year. He applied his front brake and went headfirst over the handlebar before hitting the back of a parked van. He died instantly from from neck and chest injuries. The teen, who cannot be named, has today been sentenced to three years and two months in a Young Offender Institution at Bristol Crown Court. He pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Rice, accepting that he unlawfully killed him, on Thursday.    Judge Peter Blair QC, the Recorder of Bristol, said reporting restrictions banning the identication of the defendant must remain in place following the case. He told the boy: Your decision to drag a bicycle, on its side, off the pavement so as to cause an obstruction, was an unlawful and dangerous thing to do. In my view, when you took the decision to do that dangerous thing, you were doing it so as to impress the older teenagers around you. However, any reasonable person would have inevitably realised that doing so risked causing the motorcyclist some bodily harm. It was a reckless act. During the trial, Adam Vaitilingam QC said the motorbike Mr Rice had been riding on April  had been stolen a day earlier.  Mr Rice was from the Knowle West area of Bristol and was riding around the Hartclfe area in a provocative way, he told the jury. The keen motorcyclist first passed the Fulford Arms pub on Fulford Road once, drawing attention to himself from a crowd of children and young people outside. He ed a second time, with people in the crowd suggesting that people should block the road to stop him - with one going forward on a bicycle to face him. The teenager, then aged , grabbed hold of the YoBike and dragged it into the road.  Collision investigators calculated that Mr Rice was travelling between mph and mph at the time of the impact with the YoBike. Judge Blair said it would have been possible for Mr Rice to have stopped to avoid the bike but he was accelerating and pulling a wheelie at the time. It was not the impact of the motorcycle with the bicycle which led to the fatality, the judge said. Instead it was his panicked reaction to what was in front of him in the road which led to him applying the front brake lever while the front wheel was still in the air. Tragically, that led to him going over the handlebars of the motorcycle when it touched down and he was killed in an instant when he collided with a parked van.  In a victim personal statement, Mr Riceaposs mother Donna Rice described the impact of her sonaposs death on her family and his girlfriend. Mike was a loving, caring person, she said. It feels like so long since we have been able to see Mikeaposs cheeky smile and hear his infectious laugh. Andrew Langdon QC, representing the boy, said he was horried by the unintended consequences of his act. The defendant was screened off from the public gallery during his trial and sentencing.

Police have arrested four iniduals in connection with the assault which took place on Saturday in Leicester. Footage of the incident was posted to Twitter yesterday by the page ‘London Kne Crime Ldn.’ The video shows a gang of youths walking in a park appearing to threaten another boy.  One of the youths can be seen raising his arm with an object in his hand, which police later said was a BB gun. The boy is then pushed to the ground and he is stomped on repeatedly. Another youth can be seen holding an unknown object as he kicks the boys head. Another child then walks away from the scene stuffing a hammer under his top and another youth can be seen brandishing a pistol by his side.  A police spokeswoman said: Leicestershire Police received a report of an assault on a -year-old boy in the area of Beaumont Walk, Leicester, on Saturday afternoon . It was reported the boy had been assaulted by a number of other youths in the incident which happened sometime between .pm and pm.

Barney Rule, , has followed in the footsteps of Scottish singing duo The Proclaimers - and has walked more than , miles since going for a walk after deciding to drop out of the University of Edinburgh on September . The former history and politics student, wanted to aposclear his headapos after going on a big night out after he called time on uni. He started walking in the early hours after leaving a nightclub - but after walking for a whole night, realised he didnapost want to stop walking, heaposs now decided to head for Valencia, Spain -  more miles away.  Barney, originally from Chester, has been walking for over a month now, and is currently in the south west of France - as heaposs taking the scenic route to Spain. Setting off from Chester, Barney has walked through Chester to Ross on Wye to Poole - where he hopped on a ferry to continue onto Cherbourg to Bricbeque to Portbait to St Germain Sur Ay to Rennes to Nantes to Angers to Saintes to Jonzac to Bordeaux. He claims to average just over  miles a day, with his trip being entirely self-funded. Barney said: I had always wanted to walk to Spain but it wasnapost until I got drunk with friends last month that I actually began walking.  It was only by the time I got to the second night, when I reached around  miles, that I realised - I was actually walking, actually doing it with no turning back. I wasnapost sure it was legal, but I knew I needed to clear my head. I started off just sleeping rough, but Iaposve picked up a tent and a few other things along the way but time alone on the road seems to be good for me. Iaposve had time to think and really be alone in my thoughts, figure out my next steps and what I want to do. But the kindness Iaposve seen from people has been amazing. I had a tent with me, and Iaposve asked peopleI could pitch it in their land as Iaposve walked to the port in Poole. I vividly recall being in Shropshire, and because Iaposd spent the previous three days really just going for it, because I knew I was only  miles away from the port, when I asked, I couldnapost understand the accent. It might as well have been Mandarin for all I understood, and it was there that I woke up to being surrounded by cows.  Barney spent £ as a foot passenger at the port crossing, and estimates in the last month, combining the nights heaposs had no choice but to stay in a BB or at a camping site, he has spent only about £. He added: A lot of people assumed that I was going through a bit of a crisis type thing, where Iaposd rely on the bank of mum and dad but I havenapost. Itaposs entirely self-funded from the part time work that I did at a bar, and the academic scholarships that Iaposve achieved. It was just a case that university wasnapost for me - not that it was daft or that I wasnapost taking it seriously, and my parents backed me all the way once they realised my thought process. Now I feel like Iaposve been learning far more, as Iaposm more interested now that Iaposm travelling. I know a little Spanish, travelling through France, Iaposve learnt French on the way and the people Iaposve met have been inspiring. Before, Iaposd say itaposs fair to say I was reliant on social media and that type of thing and itaposs been a noticeable break - it makes me appreciate it all the more.

Owned by entrepreneur and founder of the Dreams bed company, Mike Clare, he spent three years painstakingly redeveloping each fort to create two of the worldaposs most unique hotels. The island properties, surrounded by water, were commissioned by Lord Palmerston in the s during his time as Prime Minister, and originally took  years to build. However the Solent Forts, located near Portsmouth, were never used in battle.    After stepping back from the hotel business approximately three years ago, Mr Clare has decided to sell these properties in order to focus on other endeavours and charity interests. Estate agents Colliers is inviting offers for the freehold interest in these landmark properties and expects to soon announce a bid deadline. The properties are estimated to reach a combined sale price in excess of £ million. In keeping with the unique nature of the forts and aside from buyers looking to continue the current use, we are expecting and would welcome interest from buyers looking to re-purpose the properties to say, ultra-private residences, corporate retreats or exclusive use venues, said Paul Barrasford, director in Colliers Internationalaposs Hotels Agency team.    This is an incredible opportunity to acquire two of the most remarkable properties to come to the market in recent years. Commissioned by prime minister, Lord Palmerston, during his tenure between  to , the forts were built as a line of defence against enemy attacks on the Solent and Portsmouth. They took  years to build but were never used in battle as intended - instead they were re-purposed as temporary army barracks before being decommissioned by the Ministry of Defence in . Known as the Solent Forts, the properties, No Manaposs Fort and Spitbank Fort, are available as combined properties and businesses or on an inidual basis. No Manaposs Fort has been transformed to create a four-star island hotel venue. With a maximum capacity of , guests can hire the entire venue exclusively for weddings, corporate events and celebrations.    The property has  ensuite guest bedrooms suites, staff quarters, a restaurant, five themed bars, laser battle play area and a spa. It also features a lighthouse with private dining, rooftop hot tubs, sauna, fire pit, hot pool and helipad. Spitbank Fort is an even more upmarket offering with nine luxurious guest suites plus staff accommodation, events spaces including a restaurant, two bars and a wine cave. Totalling some ,sq ft over three floors with  foot thick granite walls, the fort has a maximum capacity of  and features an open central courtyard, plus roof top terrace including sauna, fire pit and hot pool.

We wanted to find best overall garden and best small garden – including window boxes and planters. And that’s because we felt these were what you, the Mirror readers, really cared about. Once again we have been delighted by the massive bag of entries and we’ve taken the time to read and review every single one. It’s clear that while the country may be in political turmoil, gardening is thriving, and as a nation we love colour, the craft of gardening, the memories associated with it and the sense of community that creating a great garden can bring. It’s tough being a judge. Because while it’s a great privilege to look at your creativity, it’s hard selecting winners from such a postbag of passion.    In each and every case what I’m looking for is the soul of the garden – that image, those sentiments which let me know that these Edens are our Top of the Plots. As with every postbag there are snippets from others that I’d love to share with you. I loved Patricia Olds’ letter about her garden in Whitley Bay in North Tyneside being “balm for the soul”. Her late husband Peter loved the garden and inspired her interest in it. Since he died, Patricia finds great comfort in tending it, working among the trees and shrubs he had planted, each with a memory, which makes her feel close to him. Roy and Rita Cooper shared with us the delightful story of how over the last  years they transformed the front garden of their Suffolk cottage in Stowupland, which leads out onto the village green, into an intriguing garden of pavilions, koi carp pools, terraces and lush colourful planting. In all that time they’ve only taken two holidays – their devotion to their garden is total. I can pick out the evidence of trends in British gardening over that time, from Alan Titchmarsh’s Barleywood Blue to my own love of tree ferns. This is a history of recent gardening in a capsule. Philip Canter in Chippenham, Wilts, has a lovely wavy lawn, a green carpet with ­herbaceous borders on either side to transport you to an enticing seat at the end, while Zena Everest of Crawley, West Sussex, sent an image of her crisp American-style garden which she and her husband have developed over the last  years.    It wraps around the house on two levels, and Zena tells us that her particular delight is the unexpected vistas that it opens up. It is packed with bulbs and perennials, but what really stands out are the trees and shrubs, and the perfectly maintained lawn which acts like a sharp pool of green as it helps the eye meander around and through the plot. Since , every Tuesday morning Grace Edwards and a group of ­volunteers in the Growing Together Community Garden gather at the library in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. They’ve created a haven for urban wildle, attracting birds, butterflies and bees. This community spirit brings people together, builds confidence for each ­inidual, and helps them through stresses in their own lives. It’s the power of gardening in action. Garden of the Year This year’s winner is Mary Price from Rhondda, South Wales, and her own words explain what her garden means to her better than any judge can: “The garden is my world in every season. Working in it keeps me young and well. “I find it therapeutic and uplting. The garden is never without birds, butterflies and bees. “Without boasting, it’s admired by all around, and friends and neighbours come often to enjoy it.  “I am  years young and require no help with the garden generally, except to trim wisteria and other high growers as I’m quite short. I do not in any way think of being a winner, but I have so enjoyed the journey.” I recognise the sentiments about gardening keeping you young and healthy. Gardens aren’t always going to be picture perfect – it takes hard work, skill and hope to keep going. Mary’s cottage garden is a wonderland. It doesn’t bother with trends, it appreciates the simplicity of an old crazy paving patio leading to a happy looking shed. It welcomes the hills beyond as an integral feature to the overall design and the washing line is as important as any hydrangea. At a glance I see shrubs, bulbs, annuals and climbers all in flower simultaneously. This is an explosion of colour which demonstrates the knowledge and skill that has created it. There’s a humility in its sharing – Mary doesn’t regard it or expect it to be a winner but to my mind it’s a true winner in every sense of the word. Small Garden of the Year Our Small Garden of the Year winner is Michaela Parker, who gardens in front of a ground-floor flat in Whitby, North Yorkshire. With the help of her mum, each year she grows a joyful riot of colour from seed. Her garden is in pots and containers. Hanging baskets with petunias flank the bay window, a purple cordyline explodes like a firework. The whole effect is a layered theatre set.

Forecasters have warned of devastating winds of up to mph, storm surges, giant waves, more than ft of rain in  hours, flooding and landslides. Le-threatening Hagibis is expected to be the worst typhoon of  and the most powerful storm to batter Japan in  years, forcing Rugby World Cup matches, including Englandaposs Pool C showdown with France, to be cancelled. Here is everything you need to know. When will Super Typhoon Hagibis hit     Hagibis, which means speed in the Philippine language Tagalog, was swirling towards Japan on Friday as time began to run out for those making their final preparations to leave or hunker down. Some places will begin to feel the effects as early as Friday night as rain moves in and winds become stronger. Hagibis will gradually weaken as it approaches Japan but it could still be an extremely dangerous Category  or  storm when it possibly makes landfall on the main island of Honshu on Saturday evening. It is expected to hit the Tokyo area in the evening and a possible near-direct hit on Yokosuka. The typhoon will track across Japan into Sunday before moving out into the Pacic, but potential impacts such as flooding or power cuts could last days. How bad is it going to be   Hagibis is expected to be as strong as Typhoon Ida, which killed , people in eastern and central Japan in  - and forecasters have warned of catastrophic scenarios. Winds of about mph could cause homes to collapse, according to Japanaposs Meteorological Agency, which has predicted giant waves, storm surges, record-level rainfall, flooding and landslides. The typhoon - which was a Category  storm with near mph winds earlier in the week - could make landfall at the same time as high tide in Tokyo Bay, increasing fears of flooding. There could be considerable disruption to cities such as Tokyo, Yokohama and Toyota. How is Japan preparing   Forecasters have urged those in the stormaposs path to flee their homes before it is too late, while those who are hunkering down have been told to stockpile food and supplies in case the disruption lasts several days.

Their striking appearance has not only fascinated tourists from the world over but also made the Kayan one of the most recognisable ethnic groups in Southeast Asia. Scores of tourists visit Kayan villageaposs from nearby Loikaw every year to take photos and take part in traditional activities like sausage making and ox-cart rides. Many members of the tribe have also moved to places like Chiang Mai, in Thailand, where tourists flock to see them. However, the reason why the Kayan, also known as the Padaung, women wear brass rings around their neck is not so clear.  One theory is that they were used as protection from tiger attacks and another is that they were a tribute to the tribeaposs aposdragon mother.apos More common theories point towards beauty and wealth as the rings were seen as an expensive fashion items that were commonly reserved for favourite daughters in each household.Padung author Pascal Khoo Thwe told Channel New Asia : “Our mother was a dragon - Some people say that to remember our dragon mother, they have the same sort of neck.Pascal, who wrote From the Land of Green Ghosts: A Burmese Odyssey, said he grew up seeing his grandmother wearing -inch-high sets of rings.  Mu Lone, , said many young women were not wearing the rings because of the modern culture. She added: “In my time, women weren’t beautul without neck-rings. But now, they think they look beautul without them. Mu admits that the rings, which weigh around kg, were uncomfortable when they were fitted when she was nine and they took several hours for them to be put on. She adds: “The rings choked me and felt too tight at first. Food would get stuck when I tried to swallow. I had to stretch my neck to eat. But I got used to it. For her there is no other way, as she adds:  “I’ll wear them until I die and have them buried with me.    Muu Pley, , felt very dferent about the rings and took them off  years after having them fitted over fears that her neck would grow too long. Muu, who had the rings fitted when she was seven, said they were painful and that she felt so free and so light when they were gone. The practice now faces an uncertain future with only a few hundred women believed to now be following the tradition. Pascal says many of the women who do wear them often do due to economic pressures as tourists flock to see the aposlong-neckedapos women. Mum-of-two Muu Pley is among them and says she decided to put the rings back on following a tourism boom in the village.

You don’t like to change your centre-backs.“He has worked away and has probably trained for a longer period of time than he has here for a while.“That’s the big thing. Get him training consistently then you can see the benefit.“In the second half last Saturday he was excellent, both centre-halfs were. They were really dominant and in control and never looked in any pressure in the second half.”Meanwhile, the Dens gaffer hopes Declan McDaid’s double last week against the Red Lichties can give the former Ayr winger the “belief” to push on and add the goals he is capable of.“Declan has been great,” James added. “We’ve all given him a bit about not scoring because he’s great in training.“He’s positive, scores goals and takes people on. If you got our squad to pick three players that have to start every game I think most of them would pick Declan.“Going backwards for a forward player is great for the team defensively and he deserved those goals against Arbroath because they have been coming.“It’s about belief with him because he can be a match-winner and we need that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d970e153c3919.99006593-e1570180930942-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds new scotland star shankland keen to silence his doubters","story":"Lawrence Shankland wants to surprise the naysayers who questioned his Scotland call-up.Eyebrows were raised when the Dundee United striker was named in Steve Clarke’s squad earlier this week for the upcoming Euro  qualying double header against Russia and San Marino.The -year-old has scored  goals in  games in the Ladbrokes Championship this season but his inclusion has split opinion, with former Scotland striker Kris Boyd claiming that it was a “sad indictment on Scottish football.”However, Shankland is confident that he can prove to be the right man for Scotlandgiven a chance.The former Ayr forward said: “I certainly hope so.

living in a new north-east housing development will be sent to a school nearly  miles away.Councillors at Aberdeenshire Council’s education and children services committee rubber -stamped the plans for the Blairs housing development yesterday.It means secondary pupils will travel to Mackie Academy in Stonehaven instead of the closest school, Cults Academy.A report to councillors said “capacity issues” at Cults Academy meant children from the development could not be given places at the school.It added that the only avenue left for Aberdeenshire Council to pursue was zoning the pupils at Mackie Academy following a consultation.Aberdeen City Council decided in  that residents in any new housing development would not be entitled to attend Cults and would need rezoned to an Aberdeenshire Council school.A section of the Blairs site with  homes was originally zoned to Cults Academy, but the decision by councillors means all pupils will now attend Mackie Academy.Education officers at the meeting said the situation where part of the development was zoned where was an “anomaly”.Concerns were raised by councillors regarding the distance children may need to travel.Stonehaven councillor Sarah Dickinson said: “For those young people now zoned at Mackie they will have a fairly long commute to school and there are sustainability and transport issues that come with that.“We have to

opportunity.“The decision has been taken by the city for us.”Gillian Owen, chairwoman of the committee, said she had meetings with her city counterparts and described the situation as “fluid”.The report by Laurence Findlay, director of education and children services, said: “Officers within education and children’s services have carefully considered all of the responses to the consultation, and have made a recommendation.“That recommendation is that all of the housing at the Blairs housing development should be zoned for Mackie Academy.“The proposal could result in staffing and financial implications for Mackie Academy depending on the number of pupils attending from the Blairs housing development.“There could be increased transport costs as the pupils residing in the Blairs housing development would be entitled to free school transport to Mackie Academy as they reside over three miles from the secondary school.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45790926-3-240x180.jpg

Lochgilphead High School Pupils to design a new name and logo for our services which has been launched in the High School this week.Our name and logo will be changing, but the care we deliver and how we deliver it will not be changing under our current plans.In  the GPs in Lochgilphead took over the surgeries in Inveraray and Furnace. The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

As a warm up for their main stage gig on Sunday, The Mad Ferret Band drew in the crowds at The Corner House, while Gubbed had the Islay Frigate dance floor well used as they rocked the night away.The jam session in the harbour marquee on Saturday afternoon brought together a host of musicians, while a fantastic £. for festival funds was raised at the coffee morning held at Templar Arts and Leisure Centre.The Mad Ferret Band eased the Sunday survivors into the day’s event at the quay but it was not long before the crowd were back on their feet dancing and singing along. The great musical entertainment continued throughout the afternoon with performance from Gary Innes and Rhuvaal.Speaking after the weekend-long event, organiser Margaret MacNeill said: #Thanks to everybody who helped out with the coffee morning. Special thanks also to all the bands and everyone who came to support Tarbert Music Festival. Saturday was busier than ever, helped by the good weather.#Tide Lines brought something special to the weekend and the gig was sold out well in advance, so look out for more ticketed events in future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"salmon firm funds inveraray shinty equipment","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Shinty Club has been boosted by a donation from the Scottish Salmon Company#s community fund.The money will allow the club’s junior team to invest in new training kit and goal posts, enhancing their ability to compete in games and tournaments.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up.

The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood.

Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

In Europe and US, this figure is around  per cent compared with  per cent  years ago. Estimates suggest that very soon . billion people, that is a third of the world’s population, will be myopic.Babies# eyes grow rapidly, reaching near-adult size by  years of age. Myopia results when this growth is altered and the eyeball is elongated. This causes the lens’ focus to be shted from the retina to slightly in front of it, resulting in blurred vision. Although vision can be corrected with glasses, contact lenses or surgery, it increases risk of eye diseases # retinalSo what is the cause of the myopia epidemic and how can it be prevented For years, myopia was claimed to be a genetic problem, but to account for the recent dramatic rise there must be additional environmental factors.As this rise coincided with Asian children spending more time studying , and most children, irrespective of nationality, poring over smartphone and computer screens, too much close-up work seemed the obvious answer.Some experts still back this theory, but several large comparative studies on children’s daily routines do not. Instead, the only environmental risk factor uncovered by these studies is lack of time spent outdoors.The results show that children who spent less time outdoors have a greater risk of myopia regardless of time spent studying. The key to protection from myopia seems to be the eye’s exposure to bright light.The scientic reasoning behind this finding is unknown, although animal experiments suggest that a deficiency of light-stimulated chemicals in the retina can block normal eye development.Whatever the fault, prevention is not dficult to devise – send the children outside for more sunlight, more physical activity and overall a more healthy existence.PICS:no_aScienceMattersMyopia"},{"url":null,"title":"september festival fun for soccer kids","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowIt was a busy September for kids from Red Star youths, with teams attending festivals at Haldaneand Lochnell thanks to sponsorship from Ardrishaig Community Trust and Ventient Energy A’Chruach Community Fund.Almost  kids headed off to Alexandria in early September for the popular and competitive Haldane festival playing against new teams from across the West of Scotland.Lochgilphead were represented by teams at , ,  and  age groups with each working hard and testing themselves against some really good teams.

The group, the Mull of Kintyre Milk Supply Cooperative, will fund the purchase through use of a levy from every litre of milk produced, in addition to external funding which is currently being sought.A key element of the funding is the launch of the crowdfunding campaign which seeks to raise £, towards the purchase. The group is encouraging the local community, foodies, suppliers, customers, businesses and anyone with a love of cheese to contribute and further information can be found at www.crowdfunder mokcheddarIn  First Milk, a British farmer-owned dairy co-operative, announced plans to sell Campbeltown Creamery as part of a move away from smaller-scale brands. This created an opportunity for a farmer-led buy-out, aimed at saving the creamery and securing its future and the positive impact it has upon the area.The dairy farming sector in the Kintyre Peninsula and nearby Gigha contributes £.m per annum to the local economy. In turn, when additional upstream impacts are considered, a further £.m is added. The dairy sector in the area provides  jobs directly on-farm and a further  indirectly across Kintyre.Local dairy farmer Thomas Cameron said: #We are currently facing a huge and exciting opportunity with a clear mission – to secure the future of the Campbeltown Creamery for the benefit of the Kintyre community. We will also be in a position to save a well-known brand and contribute to Scotland’s reputation as a Land of Food and Drink.#Mull of Kintyre cheddar is said to be enhanced by the #Angel’s Share# of whisky that remains in the creamery building from its past le as a distillery.

Given the challenges of sustaining a vibrant economy in this remote part of Scotland, the role of the dairy sector in Kintyre is fundamental to its success.#Our farmers are young, enthusiastic, committed to sustainability, investment and the next generation and have strong integrity – they are just the right group of people to secure this deal.#We have produced a great video which shows just why the Campbeltown Creamery is so pivotal to the area and why Mull of Kintyre cheddar is so important to Scotland and I encourage everyone to please support us by heading to the crowdfund website and spreading the word.#NFU Scotland Milk Committee Chairman John Smith commented: #This is a bold and inspiring bid from producers in Kintyre to preserve their creamery and to continue making world-famous, award-winning Mull of Kintyre cheddar.#These hard working family farms have built their businesses with a view to continuing to milk cows building and promoting the Mull of Kintyre brand locally and nationally and are looking positively to the future.#Dairy farmers in Kintyre have a fantastic story to tell,  producing high quality grass-fed milk in a beautul part of the country.  Funders will take the Mull of Kintyre brand to the next level by getting behind a cheese that has real provenance.#"},{"url":null,"title":"birthday-bash-blues-club","story":"THEY might be singing the blues ndash but they certainly wonrsquot be feeling them as the popular Borders Blues Club celebrates its first anniversary.Musicians will bring their love of the blues genre to the Vale Club where they hope to entertain locals this evening .Club co-founder and chairman Paul Burnett said: ldquoWe can hardly believe that itrsquos been a year since we started to bring blues music to the Scottish Borders.\"We wanted to host a friendly, accessible club, with blues acts playing regularly in a venue that the music-loving public can recognise as the place to hear quality musicians celebrating the broad genre of the blues and I think we have begun to do exactly that.He added: ldquoWe have had very positive feedback from both audiences and musicians about the warmth of welcome and the energy that the club gives people who come here and, through word of mouth, our artists are becoming very keen to come and play here.ldquoWe have been blessed with well-known talent from the blues and rock world over the past year including ex-Argent frontman John Verity and rising stars Redfish as well as first class talent from local acts such as Sam Mundy and Unfinished Business.\"Wisconsin USA power trio the Tommy Bentz Band will headline the birthday bash.Tommyrsquos outfit has been playing for over  years with multiple recordings and festival appearances to his name.He jams in a style he describes as the Allman Brothers meets Van Morrison.He will be supported by Glasgow bluesman Andrew Robert Eustace.Tickets are pound and all door money will go directly to the artists.The evening kicks off at .pm and tickets can be purchased on the door at the Vale Club, Innerleithen or The Hub on the High Street."},{"url":null,"title":"wooly-wrangling-fun-manor-valley","story":"UP to  sheepdogs with their handlers will flock to Manor Valley on October  for the annual Manor Sheepdog Trails.Nearing ever closer to its diamond anniversary, the trials will celebrate its th year of testing the skills of sheepdog and human alike and seeing who comes out as top dog.But it wont just be the dogs in the limelight.

After some detailed discussion it was agreed that these affected areas would continue to be mown regularly to maintain the appearance of the park, said Mr Turnbull.But the community council agreed that bioersity could be increased in an area of Haylodge that would not detract from the amenity of open spaces.Mr Turnbull explained: ldquoA suggestion was made that a flat piece of parkland at the extreme western end of the park could be converted into a community orchard where fruit trees that thrive in our climate could be planted, this could include ieties of apple, pears and plums and such like.ldquoIt is reassuring to see that managers in SBC recognise the validity of the communityrsquos concerns and have agreed not to make any changes, as proposed, in the way these areas are currently managed. The suggestion for a community orchard at the western end of the park is, in my view, a good one.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here.

An assiduous promoter of gender equality, Professor Belch pointed out that despite the wealth of opportunities open to women in medicine, when it comes to the most prestigious areas, such as heart surgery, men are still top dog.ldquoThese are jobs where you may be required to work from six in the morning to  at night, she said, ldquoand most women decided that they prefer to work part-time rather than commit to that. Not that she blames them: ldquoAfter all, we fought for their right to choose.Part-time employment is now the main obstacle in the campaign for women to be on a par with men. When a female doctor first hooks a stethoscope around her neck the future looks,not precisely plain sailing, then navigable.However,at some point she starts a family, or has older relatives to care for, opting to work part-time creates an unsolvable quandary. You could call the shorter working week a womanrsquos wrecking ball, the destroyer of youthful aspirations.Speak to thirtysomething medics, who started out intending to become heroic surgeons and physicians, and you will detect a weariness, and also a resignation to the fact that the conditions in which they are expected to perform are incompatible with any kind of normal le, let alone raising a family.As a result, an essential tier of the health system voluntarily removes itself from the full-time rota. And while hospital-based medicine is undoubtedly at the extreme end of professional expectations, given the prolonged, intense and erratic shts, what goes for medicine is also true of other careers: the advocate who must work into the small hours and over weekends to keep on top of her case load the head teacher who is in the school before breakfast, and once back home works until bedtime the farmer who labours every day of the year the journalist who cannot clock off until the late-breaking story is filed.No wonder people in these occupations wondertheyrsquove been put on the rack, as they are slowly stretched to breaking point. Yet when doctors, and other high-fliers, decide to go part-time, it is a self-inflicted slow puncture. All the training, expertise and experience they have acquired, all the momentum they have gathered, begins to deflate. Friends and family feel secretly disappointed that a seemingly stellar career has lost its stardust. Worse, the part-timer often feels she is in some unfathomable way to blame for not being able to juggle everybodyrsquos expectations, including her own, yet still have a le worth living.By drawing attention to the part-time glass ceiling, Professor Belch highlights how complicated and protracted the business of reaching true equality remains. The effort to increase the number of women entering medical school, which was once seen as the solution to the predominance of males, succeeded years ago. Indeed, that hurdle has been so successfully overcome there are sometimes more girls in class than boys.The problem is that, in the early years of feminism, none of us looked far enough ahead. Lacking imagination, perhaps, or brimming with optimism, we did not give a thought to the lelong path ndash more accurately a tight-rope ndash on which working women must keep their balance. Once aloft, they need to stay upright not merely when they are young and full of energy, but as their lestyles change, their commitments grow, and their attitudes mature.Belchrsquos comments are a long overdue corrective to the notion that the ward ndash or boardroom, laboratory, lecture hall ndash is as welcoming for women as men. In so doing she has also pointed to the unrealistically tough regime in which many professionals are expected to survive. Itrsquos not just women who have a family to raise, or other caring responsibilities, and itrsquos not just women who feel they must clone themselves in order to get through everything the working day ndash and the action-packed weekend ndash demands. Singletons, or those with partners but no children, can still find employersrsquo expectations excessive and debilitating. The dedication and single-eyed focus required to keep on top of the most responsible roles takes a toll on everyone.Doubtless burn-out existed in Edwardian times, it just didnrsquot have a label. Today we have inherited a pitiless culture in which status is calculated by how visibly gruelling your job is. The more punishing your hours and the less time you have at home, the higher your place on the ladder of awe. The employee who can be home shortly after five, and has all evening in which to help their kids with homework or go to the gym, is unlikely to score impressively on the Richter scale of professional achievement. Yet she, or he, might have a really well thought-out le, with their priorities in the right order.The dilemma facing society is not simply how to help part-time women reach the very top but how to recalibrate these Alpha workplaces. The challenge for employers who do not want talented staff to drt off or grow disheartened is to come up with ways to make these all-consuming roles desirable, but also manageable, for a far wider range of iniduals.At the moment, physical and psychological stamina are almost as essential as professional excellence for someone to thrive in such an environment. Yet how many does that automatically exclude  Instead of a place that resembles the trenches, we need to restructure hospitals, banks, or the courts, so that they properly value ambitious and able part-timers. Far from discriminating against their promotion, they should encourage it. A good place to start might be to banish the adjective ldquopart-time, and its belittling connotations, once and for all."},{"url":null,"title":"hand-sends-memo-wields-much-power","story":"Anonymous Downing Street adviserldquoAdvisers advise and Ministers decide.Margaret ThatcherHE likes a quote, does Dominic Cummings. The Prime Ministerrsquos chief adviser might or might not have been the author of an  word note to a Spectator journalist setting out the dire consequences for anyone who dared to scupper the UKrsquos exit from the EU on October , but several Tory MPs, including former Minister Amber Rudd, thought they saw his fingerprints all over it. Eight hundred words, eh  Someone was quite the demented woodpecker.Complaints were made in the Commons about intemperate language from Number , and fevered brows were duly soothed by Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Mr Gove knows Mr Cummings well. When the Scot became Education Secretary he brought him into Government as his adviser. Their ties go back even further, some  years, to when they were both starting out in their careers.Mr Gove is in a select club of those who can claim familiarity with Mr Cummings. Others look to his blog for clues, which is where they will find quote after quote, from TS Eliot to From Russia With Love , to back up his philosophy of government, the universe and everything. If you have an extremely high boredom threshold, and a liking for the kind of macho guano contained in the business section at airport bookshops, I can thoroughly recommend it.: Civil court delays decisionThe Number  aide is not the first adviser to provoke interest. From Marcia Falkender and Alastair Campbell to Nick Timothy and Fiona Hillthere is a special circle in political anorakdom reserved for those unelected iniduals who serve elected politicians.The latest data on special advisers in the UK Government puts their number at . Their salaries, which can range from pound, to pound,, cost the taxpayer pound million. But they are everywhere where politicians gather, from Bute House to the White House, and rarely will you know them by name. Lobby journalists know them, they know each other, and the civil servants know them, but generally speaking the special adviser, or Spad, is the man or woman standing out of sight of the cameras. Like journalists, when they become the story it is time to go. Think Jo Moore, the Labour adviser who will forever be known for saying   was a ldquogood day to bury bad news.Every so often, as in the Moore case, or when a question is asked about the number of advisers and their cost to the public purse, Spads will come under the spotlight, only to fade away again when something more interesting turns up. Mr Cummings has changed that. From sacking a member of staff and having them marched off the premises, as happened with an aide to the Chancellor, Sajid Javid, to ramping up the political temperature, Mr Cummings is rewriting the rules as he goes. Such is Boris Johnsonrsquos reliance on him that he is less a mere aide and more a de facto deputy Prime Minister.Special advisers are nothing new. From the first time someone claimed power over others, courts have had their courtiers. Whether in government or out, their tasks are many and ied. They are supposed to be their bossrsquos eyes and ears, there to pick up on things in advance. They think ahead in other ways, planning the direction of policy, the subjects for legislation or other action. Crucially, they have some control over access to the politician and cling to it for dear le. If anyone can have the ear of the minister, why do they need you : Iain Macwhirter on the blame gameSpecial advisers stayed for the most part behind the curtain until Harold Wilsonrsquos resignation honours of . The ldquolavender list of recipients, some of them highly questionable, was said to have been drawn up on coloured notepaper by Wilsonrsquos chief aide, Marcia Falkender. She denied doing so.Lady Falkender, who died earlier this year, was valued by Wilson for her insights into the minds of so-called ordinary voters she was a tireless planner and she was not afraid of making enemies in the party or in the civil service, especially the latter. The agenda, Wilsonrsquos agenda, had to get through. Remind you of anyone Labour politicians seem to have a thing for the adviser as enforcer. Though neither inidual will relish the companion, this yearrsquos Dominic Cummings was yesteryearrsquos Alastair Campbell. Tony Blairrsquos spokesman wielded extraordinary power, right up to and including putting a case together for war that turned out to be entirely wrong. Campbellrsquos chief asset, as far as Blair was concerned, was his willingness to be an attack dog on the bossrsquos behalf.One can understand why political leaders like to surround themselves with special advisers. As many a memoir sets out, it is tough and lonely at the top. A bad day at the office for most folk is just that, a bad day. For a leader it can be a catastrophe. The stream of questions is relentless, the need to make a decision always pressing. Who would not want to turn to a friendly face, someone you knew was in your corner, at such times  Before the special adviser came along there were such people. There still are such people. They are called civil servants. They can give impartial advice because their tenure is not tied to any one politician or administration.: Brexit deal on brinkAnother argument in favour of special advisers is that they bring new voices and viewpoints into government. Exceptyou had ever met one you would know they did the opposite. The special adviser is a symptom of the wholly unhealthy professionalisation of politics.

Ive leapt right in there on the assumption the tale of Eva Bolander and the Shellac Toes is now ubiquitous. Its been dissected on Twitter, chewed over on current affairs TV and made the English press so Im assuming everyone has had a scan of the list of purchases made by Glasgows first citizen using the public purse.Ms Bolander, over two years, spent pound of public money on ious items related to theof her role, which is to represent the city and welcome dignitaries and officials.Spending pound a year from a fund of pound - an amount allowed for the Lord Provost and her bailies - has, to a great many, appeared grotesque at a time when the city is struggling under the weight of a drugs crisis and increased homelessness, while residents are living in poverty and foodbank use is on the rise. Not to mention Glasgow is settling a vast bill for underpaying its female workers.:Calls for Glasgow Lord Provost to resign over controversial pound, expenses claimsThese, though, are systemic problems not fixable by the LP shopping in Primark.Most harrumphed at are the purchases of underwear,  pairs of shoes and Shellac manicures and pedicures. And pound for glasses. Should have gone to Spectaclesavers.The pain is all the greater at being let down by a Swede when were relentlessly lectured about how marvellous are all things Scandinavian.In lieu of a sex scandal, there is nothing more satisfying than an expenses scandal. The public is rightly protective of its coffers, it has a natural suspicion of politicians and we like an opportunity to be outraged. In this instance much has been made of the fact the previous female Lord Provost of Glasgow did not touch her civic allowance.Right, but Sadie Docherty did spend pound, flying business class to Malawi on a trip to see how Glasgowrsquos aid money was being spent.She also flew business class to New York for Tartan Week at a cost of more than pound,. On four trips, the civic purse paid for her husband to accompany her.This is her husband whose salary, as chief executive of Glasgow City Council armrsquos- company City Building, rose from pound, to pound, in one year. Presumably he could afford his own flights.But pointing out that Ms Bolanderrsquos predecessor did not need to use her clothing allowance is a woeful argument. She did not use it because she did not need it. Mrs Docherty was wealthy and she used the public purse to treat herself to luxury travel at a cost far more than pedicures.The chef Tom Kerridge was this week telling the Cheltenham literature festival that pound. is a reasonable sum for fish and chips. Fresh dayboat turbet, he said, with hand cut chips from ldquoincredibly expensive potatoes. ldquoEasily justiable, he called it.:Glasgows Lord Provost Eva Bolander issues apology over expenses claimsOne manrsquos obscenity is another manrsquos fish tea. Ms Bolander spent around pound per pair of shoes, expensive for some but a reasonably priced purchase for others.Her pound hat has been styled as a hat ldquomade by a designer used by supermodel Kate Moss. Itrsquos a hat from William Chambers, a Glasgow-based milliner who has relentlessly worked his way up through the ranks over the past  years. The LP likely believed she was promoting local business.She claimed for items made from Harris Tweed, presumably for occasions promoting Scotland - occasions specically related to her job.Itrsquos hardly a call out for bees to be removed or the cleaning of a moat. Or a duck house.The argument then becomes that the position of Lord Provost should be open only to those who can afford to take on a role that involves the financial outlay of regular black tie dinners and high profile appearances. Or only open to men.Lets face it, this is a uniquely female problem. For men, one dinner suit and youre laughing. The mayor of the Canadian town of Coquitlam, Richard Stewart, wore the same suit for  months to every council meeting and public event to seeanyone noticed. No one noticed. Mr Stewart was attempting to highlight the sexism in the way womenrsquos clothing is scrutinised while menrsquos is not.Famously, Sian Williams, BBC then Channel  presenter, was refused a tax rebate on work clothes by HM Revenue and Customs. She applied for an pound rebate on the annual pound she spends on her appearance because a judge ruled that it was not possible to extrapolate the business and private benefits of the expenditure.Ms Williams quibbled over the issue for years because her job necessitated looking a certain way.The clothing choices of women in the public eye are relentlessly dissected. Theresa Mayrsquos lust for fashion - she told Desert Island Discs her luxury item would be a letime subscription to Vogue - was picked over in an obscene amount of column inches, from the Roland Mouret dress she wore to the Tory party conference to her Amanda Wakeley jacket and Vivienne Westwood trouser suit.Ms Bolanderrsquos pedicure and shoe purchases were scorned and scoffed at. Yet donrsquot we remember the Sun making a front page splash out of a close up of Theresa Mayrsquos leopard print pumps Its frustrating to live in a society where a high profile and successful woman feels pressure to have her toes painted while on official business.Yet you cant argue with her press photographers take images so high res as to be able to see a persons pores. Stories are made from famous women having slight underarm hair or a few grey strands. There is intense pressure on women, particularly in the public eye, to conform to certain standards and those standards cost money.Eva Bolander represents the city of Glasgow. She is entitled to spend a certain amount of money in the fulfilment of that role and that is what she has done. Either you agree that Lord Provosts should be provided with civic allowances or you dont.Andyou dont then the call should be for the spending allowance to be cut, not for a woman to be scalped because youre aggrieved her haircut costs too much."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-exports-stunted-uncertainty-brexit-tariffs-currency","story":"A study by the British Chambers of Commerceand Bibby Financial Services suggested that the lack of clarity over the UKs future trading environment was \"clearly taking its toll\".A survey of , businesses found that Brexit uncertainty was the main barrier to exporting.Only a minority of firms that only trade in the UK expect to start exporting or importing goods over the next three years, said the report.BCC director general Dr Adam Marshall said: \"UK businesses are facing unprecedented levels of uncertainty on multiple trading fronts and, unsurprisingly, theyre holding back on importing and exporting.\"Just this week, the Government finally provided some certainty around tarfs - but the damage of uncertainty was already done for many firms.\"While international trade always involves an element of risk for businesses, Government should be working to lower barriers rather than increasing them.\"Preventing a messy and disorderly Brexit is the immediate priority, but ensuring continuity of trade with third countries and providing firms with clear and timely information about future trade processes would go a long way to removing unnecessary obstacles.\":Hopes of Brexit breakthrough after lsquopositiversquo UK-Ireland talksEdward Winterton, UK chief executive at Bibby Financial Services, said: \"Chronic uncertainty resulting from Brexit is undoubtedly stling international trade amongst UK SMEs .\"Importers and exporters are in limbo and many are postponing investment decisions while they await further information.\"Many others are focusing resources on ensuring theyre prepared to deal with the potential impacts of a no-deal scenario.\"A government spokeswoman said: \"It is unclear how representative this survey is of the business population with products or services traded internationally, orit takes account of the normal churn in firms which start and stop exporting each year as part of the normal dynamics of our economy.\"We have already signed trade continuity agreements with countries accounting for pound billion of UK trade to safeguard the needs of our exporters and will continue to work with trade associations to ensure businesses are ready to trade as we approach Brexit on October .\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9224300.jpg?type=article-full","title":"snp-accuse-bbc-selective-storytelling-political-representation","story":"In a statement, Keith Brown, the SNPs depute leader accusedthe corporation of selective storytellingIt comes after theLib Dems had more than double the amount of SNP appearances on the broadcasterrsquos main political shows throughout September.Data reported in our sister paper The National, showed the Lib Dems had  guests slots to the SNPs  with the Lib Dem conference being part of the reason for more guest slots.

Despite this latest sanctionI have no regrets whatsoever that I chose to follow this path. The present resurgent state of Rangers is sufficient reward for me.It is important to note that in its findings the Hearings Committee found no evidence of detriment to RIFCrsquos shareholders and further noted that any non-compliance by me with the rules of the Takeover Panel was not motivated by financial gain or commercial advantage. Quite the opposite. My investment was motivated ndash to quote the Hearings Committee ndash ldquosolely for the love of the club.RIFC and Rangers Football Club are not affected by the Hearings Committeersquos ruling and the ruling does not impact upon my position as Chairman and a director of RIFC. I have ensured that RIFC has complied with the requirements of the Code throughout the period of my Chairmanship, notwithstanding that the Company is no longer listed. RIFC will continue to comply with the Code. The Takeover Panel has raised no concerns about RIFCrsquos compliance with the Code in the more than four and a half years since regime change.\""},{"url":null,"title":"rab-mcneil-poor-old-pizza-express-asked-queen-elves-help","story":"Educated readers will recognise this as Elvish, the words being those spoken by Galadriel at the beginning of the Lord of the Rings movie, The Fellowship of the Ring. Rough translation: ldquoThe world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air.Irsquove been thinking similar thoughts myself this week, except they ran more like this: ldquoThe world is changing. I feel it in the high street. I feel it in John Lewis. I taste it in the chips. .I say ldquochips but pizza might have been a better choice of pabulum . News that Pizza Express is the latest high street institution facing financial dficulties sent shock waves around the nation this week.The popular restaurant chain is reportedly in talks with its creditors after running up debt of pound million. Thatrsquos pound. million per restaurant. Howrsquos that even possible  Theyrsquore not giving the food away.High rents and ldquochanging consumer habits are adduced as causes for the fall, the latter being a reference to home delivery apps where you have grub delivered to your hoose and donrsquot have to tip waiters or, in the case of Pizza Express, put up with children bawling their heids off and bunging bits of dough hither and yon.It has to be said, too, that the drinks menu is rubbish and that theyrsquove missed a trick in not being like other restaurants and charging pound for a bottle of plonk that costs pound in Tesco.But, apart from that, I like Pizza Express. Itrsquos customer-friendly. The waiters call you ldquoguys at least twice in every sentence, though I gather this term is now considered politically incorrect. Yawn.Itrsquos true that theyrsquore sometimes in your face, a bit too enthusiastic. A waiter should be somewhere between a butler and a social worker not a salesman or someone who proselytises. They should never correct your pronunciation, unless tactfully and with humour.But theyrsquore always friendly at Pizza Express, as is admittedly the case widely now, though it wasnrsquot always so. My family had a proletarian fear of restaurants that would put Alan Bennettrsquos to shame and, indeed, I was never in one until I was  and that was a Chinese that friends forced me to attend. I had the omelette and chips, which was still my preferred takeawayfor about a decade until I took my courage in my hands and switched to curry and chips.Before that first restaurant visit, I remember taking my teenage girlfriend to the seated section of a bakery chain .Since those days, Irsquove been to a few right posh places, but never thought much of any of them and wouldnrsquot hurry back, particularly to the one where my mate said the wine was corked. And the waiter said: ldquoBut itrsquos a screwtap bottle, sir.Irsquod rather go to Pizza Express any day. With concerns already flagged up about the position of Markies and John Lewis on our high streets, Irsquom beginning to fear that civilisation is on the brink of collapse.If Extinction Rebellion would forget weird weather and rubbishy species and take up the cause of our precious habitats and popular chains on the high street, Irsquod be out there in an instant, gluing my buttocks to something in protest.Greatness in a phone boxIF ever more evidence were needed that Britain was at its greatest during the prime ministership of Sir Harold Macmillan, it was provided this week when details of his nuclear hotline emerged.According to historian Peter Hennessy, concern was raised about how to contact the PMthere was a four-minute warning of a Russian attack and he was away somewhere. As Sir Harold didnrsquot want any fuss or expensive procedures, the answer was to have a radio link to the Automobile Association installed in his Rolls Royce.The AA would tell Sir Haroldrsquos driver he needed to reach a GPO phone box from which the PM could telephone Whitehall ndash provided he had the right change. A private secretary advised in a memo: ldquoPerhaps we should see that our drivers are provided with four pennies ndash I should hate to think of you trying to get change for sixpence from a bus conductor while those four minutes were ticking by.Another official suggested ldquodialling  and requesting reversal of the charge, adding: ldquo[This] does not take any appreciable time.It was such bumbling amateurishness that made Britain Great. How sad that itrsquos been lost under the brutally efficient leadership of Boris Johnson.Something in the airBALDIE news, and another explanation has been provided for what has caused the deplorable epidemic that has engulfed the western world. Hitherto, the scientic consensus has been that the plague was caused by lewd thoughts in the brain or, alternatively, by washing up liquid getting into the water supplies.However, the latest theory, published in The Scientic Digest of Shameful Diseases, is that air pollution from cars and lorries could be behind the condition. South Korean boffins believe sooty ldquoparticulates blooter the proteins need for hair retention.However, this seems unlikely as not every man living next to a busy road goes bald. Itrsquos just another theory concocted for the peculiar phenomenon. At a community public meeting to discuss the crisis, a neighbour of mine said it was caused by men plastering their heids with gel but, again, not everyone using hair products goes bald.No, Irsquom afraid the evidence still points to libidinous thoughts being the cause of falling follicles. In , scientic experiments to stop bald men having lewd thoughts had to be abandoned after the exercise proved impossible."},{"url":null,"title":"ellon woman heads off on mercy mission","story":"Ellon woman Sandra Campbell is preparing for a five-week trip to the West African nation of Senegal where she will be volunteering as a nurse.The -year-old is travelling to the Africa Mercy, the world’s largest charity-run hospital ship, which provides healthcare and training to developing countries.Sandra was inspired to volunteer by a visit to the previous ship, the Anastasis, and learning about the amazing work they did to bringing hope and healing to thousands of people who do not have access to affordable health care. “The surgical care given to patients is truly le transforming for these patients and their families and it is thrilling to be able to be part of it and to see the smiles on their faces when they leave the ship to go home to a better future,” she said.The floating hospital is staffed almost entirely by volunteers from over  dferent nations who work in a iety of roles to help change the lives of some of the world’s poorest people.Mercy Ships has touched more than . million lives since .“We are so grateful for the volunteers who travel to the Africa Mercy to volunteer their time and skills.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At Close the Gap, we know that it affects women because the evidence shows poverty in Scotland is gendered.By this we mean that women are more likely to be in poverty than men are more likely to experience it while in work find it harder to escape and are more likely to experience persistent poverty than men. The risk is even greater for black and minority ethnic, disabled and refugee and asylum-seeking women.So why is the experience of poverty gendered  One reason is the pay gap between men and women.This represents a letime of inequality for women. Responses to the pay gap often focus on getting more women into senior roles. While vitally important, this ignores the fact that the pay gap is also caused by women’s concentration in low-paid, insecure and undervalued work such as care, retail and cleaning.: Shona Robison to head new SNP poverty commission: Gordon Brown says child poverty ‘shames our country’ as Scottish Labour announces new loan schemeWomen are more likely than men to have caring responsibilities and therefore must find work that allows them to balance earning with caring. However, most part-time work is found in the lowest paid jobs.Women’s employment is becoming increasingly precarious with women accounting for two-thirds of workers earning less than the living wage and  per cent of workers on zero-hour contracts. The rise in women’s self-employment has also coincided with a rise in low-paid self-employment.A positive signSexual harassment is more prevalent among women on insecure or zero-hour contracts, particularly younger women. Women on these types of contracts are also less likely to report problems for fear of repercussions, such as being denied shts or flexibility, or losing their job. This compounds the disadvantage faced by women in the gig economy, where they are already some of the lowest paid workers.Ultimately, this means that tackling inequality at work is key to tackling women’s higher rates of poverty. Despite this, the analysis of the problem is often gender-blind.However, a positive development is the publication of Fairer Scotland for Women, the Scottish Government’s first action plan. It recognises the links between gender and poverty, and women’s poverty and child poverty. The plan is clear that tackling the pay gap is essential to overcoming in-work poverty.And it has the potential to be an important anti-poverty framework, providing actions and recommendations across a range of policy areas such as early learning and childcare, skills training, employability, economic development, procurement and social security.Economic independenceFor the ambitions of this plan to be realised, women’s experiences of in-work poverty must be considered in labour market policymaking. At present, this is often not the case with key policies failing to consider women’s dferent experiences.Anti-poverty organisations must also recognise that poverty has a female face and work to understand how dferent groups of women are impacted by in-work poverty. The Living Wage campaign has already started this work, considering how the pay gap can be better reflected in campaigns work. However, this must be extended to all anti-poverty work, ensuring that women’s specic needs are explicitly addressed.For equality organisations, there is a need to ensure that poverty is a key theme of our work, highlighting its impact on women’s experiences of domestic abuse, wellbeing and economic independence. Challenging poverty in Scotland requires teamwork. Working together on these interlinked ambitions will enable us to challenge women’s economic inequality, meet Scotland’s targets on child poverty and make real progress towards closing the gender pay gap in Scotland.Ruth Boyle is policy and parliamentary officer at Close the Gap©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself.

It is my true wish to see this legacy used for the purposes of expanding manufacturing and benefiting our local community.“The Chief Executive of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council indicated, during discussions in September, that the Wrightbus legacy lands will be used for a landmark project. In the last few days it was confirmed that the Council’s poundm iC innovation Centre could be located on the site.“This will provide manufacturing start-up space and alongside the legacy lands from JTI and Michelin help Council advance their bid to collocate a Queens University led Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Centre. I believe the presence of this centre on the Wrightbus legacy land will send a clear message to Northern Ireland and beyond that Ballymena has a strong future in advanced manufacturing.” The statement added that Mid and East Antrim Borough Council “estimates that the legacy of the site and the new investment would result in , jobs with the potential to rebuild Ballymena”.It stated: “It is also has ambitious plans to secure one of the ‘Heathrow Hubs’ for the town which would see a further , engineering and manufacturing jobs for the area. The new innovative Hubs are to be used to pre-assemble components of the expanded airport before transporting them to Heathrow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2328055.jpg--.jpg?1570779679000\n","title":"union brands wright demands unrealistic calls on landowner to safeguard family legacy","story":"UNION officials have called on landowner Jeff Wright to safeguard his family’s legacy.In a hard hitting statement they say the Wright name could become ‘synonymous with the collapse of manufacturing in Ballymena’.And they have called on incoming Chief Executive of Invest NI Kevin Holland to intervene and provide full start-up supports to Wrightbus.Unite Regional Coordinating Officer, Davy Thompson challenged Jeff Wright to end his unrealistic demands .“It is our understanding that the offer put forward by Ryseremains open and on the tablethe current landowner is willing to do a deal.The big question now is whether Jeff Wright is prepared to put his father’s legacy and reputation amongst the people of Ballymena at risk.“Dr William Wright is quite rightly regarded as one of Northern Irelands leading visionaries a man who embraced progressive developments over many decades to ensure environmental concerns were at the forefront of technological advancements.Unfortunately the unrealistic demands by his son with regard to the sale of the Ballymena manufacturing site, pivotal to the safeguarding of many hundreds of jobs, will leave a bitter taste to the local community which has shown immense loyalty to the Wright family since the s.If there is no compromise from Jeff Wright, the family name will be remembered by the local community in the same vein as JTI and Michelin the other blue chip companies that recently deserted the very people that made their brands global industry icons.There is a need for action from government as well. In the absence of Stormont the Permanent Secretary Noel Lavery needs to step up to the plate and ensure that both outgoing Invest NI CEO Alistair Hamilton and his replacement Kevin Holland leave no stone unturned in the quest to safeguard the future of this workforce. The reality is thatthis was a start up foreign investor everything would be done to ensure its success. This deal offers a new company, effectively a start up and all support that can be given should be given, Mr Thompson said.Yesterday afternoon, Jeff Wright i ssued a statement saying the failure to complete a deal lay with industrialist Jo Bamford.This was after Mr. Bamford had stated he had been asked for a ‘signicantly larger sum’ in relation to the deal.Mr. Wright’s statement read: “The facts of the matters are as follows - Mr. Bamford was advised on Friday, October  that any deal would include the entire premises at Galgorm including the factory, fixtures and fittings.“These were available for lease or purchase. Mr Bamford sought to gain unrelated additional farmlands which were not for sale. It is important to note that no other bidder sought at any time to link the farmlands to the business purchase.“Mr. Bamford, as his statement confirms, did not deal with these matters until am this morning. In his response he insisted he would not proceed with the deal unless the farmlands were included.“Mr. Wright does not recognise the explanation provided by Mr. Bamford as to why he failed to conclude the purchase of the business.Earlier on Thursday, Mr. Bamford had issued his own statement of clarication, saying:  “At am this morning I made an offer to the Wright family to match the asking price for the Wrightbus factory and land. “This includes a sum to match the amount that the factory and associated land was purchased for two years ago from JTI. “Mr Wright has since refused this offer and has now asked for a signicantly higher sum of money.

I remember the feeling when I got picked for this le changing experience, I was speechless.“The amount of dedication that has to be put in is crazy, but working as a team I know we can get through it.“Something that has really been outstanding for me has definitely been the Monday night groups that I look forward to for a good laugh and good craic.“I’m just so thankful to have been chosen for this le changing experience.”Paddy Doyle from Connections Youth Project added: “I wanted to change the project a bit and develop young leaders within a school environment.“The young people have worked really hard in their preparation so far and I know we are going to have a successful trip. I can’t wait for it. It is a new programme for me as well but it will create a lot of memories and experiences for the young people.”You can keep up to date with the young people’s journey in South Africa on the Connections Youth Project Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"neurology waiting lists a disgrace","story":"ALLIANCE Health spokesperson Paula Bradshaw has branded the latest neurology waiting lists “a disgrace” and warned they are the latest example of people paying for others’ political irresponsibility.The South Belfast MLA was speaking after it was revealed the number of people waiting for a first neurology outpatient appointment here has more than doubled in the past four years.More than , patients have also been waiting more than one year to be seen.“The doubling of waiting lists in the past four years is the latest example of the Health Service descending into a two-tier system, with those who can afford it getting quick diagnoses and treatment while others are left to their anxiety about what is wrong for over a year. This is now a dysal system,” she said.“At the heart of this is the refusal of those with the biggest mandates to take the responsibility for governing which comes with those mandates. They know well a deal has long been available but decisions which are unpopular in the short term will need to be made for the long-term good of the healthcare system and public health.“We must never stop being shocked by figures such as these, which are unacceptable and show a decline in planning for the future, going back many years. It is time for comprehensive transformation or there simply will not be a public health service for the next generation # and it is time those with the big mandates took responsibility for delivery of it.”SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon called the waiting times for a first neurology outpatient appointment “unacceptable”.The North Belfast MLA said that staff are working tirelessly to manage demand while also coping with the biggest patient recall in history. “Neurology patients, people living with conditions like Parkinson’s disease, Motor Neurone disease or multiple sclerosis, should not be forced to endure the pain, worry and uncertainty of waiting over a year to be seen,” she said. “That’s the cruel reality for over , people who understand the seriousness of their condition and desperately want to be seen and treated as quickly as possible.“These patients and the staff working in neurology units deserve better. Aside from the immense challenge of having almost , people on the neurology waiting list, doctors and nurses are trying their best to cope with the biggest patient recall in our history. It must feel overwhelming.“We have had reviews of neurology services before. I have no doubt that the final report will reach similar conclusions with similar recommendations. They cannot be allowed to sit on a shelf gathering dust while real people suffer on hospital waiting lists. This is a scandal and we all have to commit to addressing it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the great outdoors at a local nursery school","story":"AIDAN Crean fully understands young people’s concern for nature and the future of our planet – in fact the west Belfast environmental supremo ‘got it’ well before anyone  did.When he was young and with the Troubles raging all around, nature and the environment weren’t high on many people’s list of priorities. But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying. And I hope this eco garden will have the same effect by inspiring the next generation of youngsters,” he said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38573258.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_109142883_constabledowney.jpg","title":"10k for psni officer discriminated against","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

clean-shaven.He later brought an employment tribunal case against then-Chief Constable George Hamilton claiming he had been discriminated against, a view which was supported by an employment tribunal.The PSNI has said it is aware of the tribunals findings and said it is currently examining the detail.Speaking to BBC News NI, Constable Downey said: \"To be turfed out of the unit, with little or no notice, for refusal to shave off a moustache, which doesnt affect the equipment Ive been issued with, is total madness.\"Read MoreMoustache would have to be a ‘belter’ to impair PSNI

centred over whether respiratory masks used in certain police units, and which are supposed to be airtight, can be used safelythe officer has facial hair.Expert advice to the tribunal  previously claimed men would need \"a moustache like a walrus\" for the equipment not to work properly.\"The policy itself was being enforced against men under health and safety grounds, and yet females within our unit had hair in contravention of the same policy, not facial hair but head hair, where there was a grab risk,\" Constable Downey said.\"So the policy was being enforced against men and not against female officers.\"Constable Downey said he tried to accommodate the policy by shaving his beard to a moustache but was also asked to remove that.\"As an older person with a receding hairline and alopecia who is slightly overweight all I can do is grow a bit of fur on my top lip, and to have that removed for absolutely no reason is wrong,\" he said.The unanimous decision of the tribunal was that Constable Downey was discriminated against contrary to the Sex DiscriminationOrder .He was awarded over £, for hurt feelings and loss of earnings.Niall McMullan from Worthingtons SolicitorsNiall McMullan from Worthingtons Solicitors, who represented Constable Downey, said it was an important ruling.\"This is a signicant ruling by the industrial tribunal, because it has essentially declared that the current PSNI policy is discriminating indirectly against males, in as far as the application of the policy is concerned,\" he said.\"I would like to see serious steps

This language does not belong to Sinn Fein, it doesnt belong to republicans - it belongs to everyone in this chamber.\"DUP councillor Brian Kingston, a former Lord Mayor, said that, while everyone should welcome that Belfast is a \"multi-lingual and international city\", the placing of Irish language signage \"is not a politically neutral act\".Cllr Kingston added, however, that the inclusion of a public consultation on the issue is a positive step.Over the last week, there has been public disagreement between councillors over Sinn Feins origanl move to simply install Irish language at the two centres, with no mention of other council facilities where in Belfast. data-dfpadtargetingCiaran BeattieRead More, days without government: Stormont’s shutdown has cost taxpayers £m, says economistHoaxers alter Gregory Campbells Wikipedia page to list him as a staunch republicanDUP blames Sinn Fein as Northern Ireland nears , days without devolutionAlliance councillor Michael Long accused Sinn Fein of trying to \"ghettoise\" the Irish language with the move.He said the partys move to only place Irish language signs in west Belfast sent out negative messages that the Irish language only belongs to one tradition.His comments were rejected by Ciaran Beattie who said the original motion had been proposed due to time constraints.\"The reality is that west Belfast has a very thriving Irish speaking community with a number of schools, youth clubs and an Irish language secondary school. We have a huge infrastructure in terms of the Irish language based in west Belfast,\" he told BBCs Good Morning Ulster.\"We have hundreds of streets in west Belfast that are bilingual, there are businesses all over west Belfast that are bilingual, even the Sainsburys in west Belfast is bilingual.Councillor Beattie said thatSinn Fein proposed an Irish sign for Lisnasharragh Leisure Centre they would be accused of \"weaponising\" the language.He said that he thought language like \"ghettoising\" was unhelpful and was \"quite insulting to many\".Linda Ervine, Irish language development officer with Turas, which promotes the language, said she thinks people in west Belfast should be able to have bilingual signage in the area.\"I very much acknowledge it is a Gaeltacht area, with people speaking and living their lives through Irish, and they have a right to have their language displayed in signage,\" she  said.But she said she is also sympathetic with the Alliance Partys viewpoint, that the signage shouldnt just be seen in one part of the city.She added that other parts of Belfast are probably not ready for bilingual signs yet, adding  \"it is still a work in progress\".\"Maybe the city council need to have a think about what its position on signage is throughout the city. Should one part of the city that wants it be denied it  Thats a very dficult situation,\" she said.Turas, which means journey in Irish, was set up in  by Mrs Ervine after she and a cross-community group of women from East Belfast Mission and the Short Strand Community Centre took part in a six-week Irish language course."},{"url":null,"title":"exgaa president sean kelly extremely disappointed at news psni team expected to fold","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The average age of the team is now mid to late thirties with a core of players that have been together for the last decade.\"We struggle to get games at the best of times as clubs have reservations about playing us and also have their own season fixtures to contend with.\"This is the first year in memory that we have had to cancel organised games because we cannot field a team, let alone a squad.\"The officer also criticised what he described as \"aggressive and rude\" treatment by civilian staff when attending training.\"I have literally watched a number of them approach my car smiling and friendly, only to become rude and obnoxious, treating me with suspicion as they set eyes on my GAA gear [PSNI GAA gear] as I attend for training.\"However ... you will see a number of civilian soccer teams using the facilities whilst wearing their Glasgow Rangers soccer jerseys without issue.\"Around % of PSNI officers are currently from the Catholic community, while Catholics make up around % of the population of Northern Ireland.In August, Chief Constable Simon Byrne said the PSNI was \"not yet back at the point\" where - recruitment of Protestant and Catholics was needed.The Chief Constable said he wanted to \"convince the people that hold me to account that we have tried every means possible to encourage people from both the Catholic community and also the working-class loyalist community, who I think need a stronger voice in policing\".The PSNI officer who did not wish to be named said: \"It is no exaggeration to say that at least  per cent of all new recruits placed in my district since the end of   are from a Protestant and or unionist background.\"With the lack of Catholic recruits presently, the number of gaels joining the PSNI is non-existent\".He said despite requests and other sports receiving financial support, players due to travel to New York this year for the Police Games have funded the trip themselves to the tune of £, each, which is subsidised by a small amount of sponsorship from GAA supporting businesses.\"All of these ongoing issues will bring an end to the PSNI GAA club,\" the officer said.A police spokesman said: \"PSNI officers are encouraged to join the GAA club, as well as other sports clubs, within the service.

We will not stop no matter what anyone says,” he said in a speech on Friday.Plumes of black smoke billowed from the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad as Turkey continued bombarding the area in an offensive that was progressing “successfully as planned,” the Turkish Defence Ministry said.Turkish troops and their allied Syrian opposition forces have advanced up to five miles into Syrian territory, Turkish vice president Fuat Oktay told TRT World television. Turkey has said the military intends to move  miles into Syria and that its operation will last until all “terrorists are neutralised.”Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish fighters to be terrorists linked to a Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey and says the offensive is a counter-terrorism operation necessary for its own national security.The Turkish Defence Ministry said four of its soldiers have been killed since Wednesday, with three wounded. Defence minister Hulusi Akar said  “terrorists” — Ankara’s term for Syrian Kurdish militiamen — have been killed so far. The figure could not be independently veried.The Kurdish-led force said  of its fighters were killed since Wednesday.The Kurdish militia has fired dozens of mortars into Turkey in the past two days, including Akcakale, according to officials in two provinces on the Turkish side.

The news followed two days of talks in Washington.“You’re very tough negotiators,” Mr Trump said to the Chinese delegation.Mr Trump has yet to change plans to impose tarfs on December  on an additional  billion dollars in Chinese products, a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the United States. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Chinese Vice Premier Liu He listens during a meeting in the Oval Office The December  tarfs would cover a wide range of consumer goods, including clothes, toys and smartphones and would likely be felt by American shoppers.Still, nervous financial markets welcomed the prospect of reduced tensions between Washington and Beijing.The two sides are deadlocked primarily over the Trump administration’s assertions that China steals technology and pressures foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as part of a drive to become the global leader in robotics, self-driving cars and other advanced technology.Beijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy the administration. Doing so would likely require scaling back China’s aspirations for technological supremacy, which it sees as crucial to its prosperity.Earlier on Friday, China announced a timetable for carrying out a promise to allow full foreign ownership of some finance businesses, starting with futures traders on January , as Beijing tries to make its slowing economy more competitive and efficient.Ownership limits will be ended for mutual fund companies on April  and for securities firms on December , the China Securities Regulatory Commission said. Until now, foreign investors have been limited to owning % of such businesses."},{"url":null,"title":"visa and mastercard pull out of facebook currency project","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Payment processing company Stripe said it is stepping back, as well as online auction company eBay.PayPal was the first of Libra’s big partners to leave, announcing last week it would no longer be involved.Facebook faced substantial criticism over its plans to create a separate, private currency system to allow cross-border payments. The Libra Association, based in Switzerland, was supposed to give the currency project a comfortable arm’sdistance from Facebook, which would not own Libra.Despite those efforts, financial regulators, as well as members of Congress on both sides of the political ide, noted the privacy issues raised with the social networking company controlling a currency, while also expressing concern about money laundering. President Donald Trump tweeted that Facebook should be subject to US banking lawsthe Libra project were to move forward.....Similarly, Facebook Libra’s “virtual currency” will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National...— Donald J. TrumpJuly , The impact of Libra’s loss of Visa and Mastercard cannot be understated. The two hold an effective duopoly over credit and debit cards in the US and Europe, and are making substantial inroads into developing countries’ payment systems. Their initial agreement to join the Libra Association instantly gave Facebook’s project legitimacy.But both companies made it clear from the onset that their interest in Libra was at least partly out of curiosity. It now appears that the political pressure on Facebook to drop the project was enough to convince a chunk of the original members to cut ties.The Libra Association said in a statement that it is “focused on moving forward”."},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners call radical activism across derry strabane","story":"Campaigners taking part in a Day of Action against welfare reform and cuts have called for “radical” activism to bring about change in society.Fty-one years on to the day, they marched the same route as civil rights protestors in Derry who fought for the allocation of houses, jobs and against limited franchise in local government elections.October , , was viewed as the day the Troubles began when police used batons and water cannon to break up the peaceful march.Organisers called for a Day of Action to retrace that original route and raise issues affecting people today such as welfare reform and cuts to health and education.Trade unions, community organisations, womens groups and campaigners from all backgrounds took to the streets demanding “urgent action”.In  the numbers were relatively small but swelled over time as ordinary people realised the need for change and trade campaigners believe that Saturday should be the beginning of sustained action.Activist group, Action Against Cuts , wore black clothing and walked behind a horse-drawn carriage carrying a casket. Other members carried a coffin with ‘NHS’ and ‘DIGNITY written on the side of it.Other messages on fake gravestones signied the death of human rights, mental healthcare, funding in education and health, and the loss of housing and welfare rights.It most certainly caught the attention of weekend shoppers who seemed confused as to whether or not it was a real funeral until they read the messages.At the Guildhall an excerpt from the film I Daniel Blake was played. It is from the funeral scene where his friend Katie reads the eulogy, including the speech Daniel had intended to read at an appeal for his jobseeker’s allowance.The speech describes his feelings about how the welfare system failed him by treating him like a dog instead of a man proud to have paid his dues to society.AAC member, Kat Healy, took to the steps of the Guildhall first to thank those who turned out for the march. In the spirit of the original civil rights march people were taking a stand against injustice, she said.People Before Profit Councillor, Shaun Harkin, also reflected on the march in  which “changed history here in the North of Ireland”. He said the numbers turning out to protest at present don’t accurately represent the depth of “anger” in the local community which is “growing and growing”.Cllr Harkin added that it is important to put pressure on “leaders” to address the devastation felt by local communities.‘Direct Action’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnother AAC member from Strabane, Michael Mclaughlin, told the crowd that he has been fighting against welfare reform for the best part of a decade.“The system is broken,” he said, and is part of an “ideological attack” on the working class. He referred to a research paper published by a university in Sheffield which studied the impact of welfare reform in the UK.A table included in that report which took in all  local authorities in the UK at the time, shows that people living in Derry and Strabane will be impacted the most with working age adults anticipated to be £ worse off per annum. Blackpool sits at the top of the table, Derry is second, Strabane third and Belfast is fourth.Mr McLaughlin said people can point the finger at Stormont but also need to look “closer to home”. It is time to “inject radicalism into activism”, he said, by getting working class people out on the streets and occupying offices were these cuts are being implemented.“We need to organise a direct action campaign against neo-liberalism, against austerity and expose and call out the parties that have let everybody down.”Member of the Irish Travelling Community, Martin McDonagh, said he was proud to be taking action and made clear that his community has felt the impact of cuts more than most.Becca Bor of Alliance for Choice slammed the two-child policy and benefit cap which she said have “massively increased” child poverty. Although primarily campaigning for free safe legal and local abortion in Ireland, the group has also fought “tooth and nail” against welfare reform, she said.She added that families are having to “scrape” money together essentials and said there is a need to fight so that women and families “have what they need”.The final speaker on the day, Goretti Horgan, of Derry Trades Union Council said large families have been impacted most by benefit caps and self-employed workers such as taxi drivers.She urged people to join a trade union, saying weekends off, holiday pay and sick pay wouldn’t exist without trade unions. “Don’t believe the hype when the Tories say they’re bringing in a living wage, read the small print, they’re saying it will happen in five years by which time normal wage increases will have brought it to that level,” she concluded."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8xMFxcXC8xMDE2NDg0N1xcXC9HcmFkZS1BLW9mZmljZS1zcGFjZS1FYnJpbmd0b24ucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvY2FjaGUucmVzaXplZC5jb1xcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiY2RlMmYyZjIyZWUwODc0M2UzZWEzMzJhY2EzNjFmNzA2Mjc2NjA3ZSJ9/grade-a-office-space-ebrington.png","title":"construction ebrington office blocks track commence next month","story":"Construction of Grade A office space at Ebrington is set to commence next month, The Executive Office has confirmed.The buildings will provide ,ft² of office space and are due to open in mid-.

The site involved is located at lands to the north of Waterside Roundabout, above the underground carpark.During the meeting Planning Committee members expressed their view that in this case it was not necessary to seek a hearing in front of the Planning Appeals Commission as the proposal was broadly in line with what had been anticipated on this important regeneration site.While a full quorum was not present to make an official decision on the notice, Council Chief Executive John Kelpie stepped in to officially progress the matter by delegated authority.Planning Officers then wrote to the Department for Infrastructure to formally noty them of the decision to allow the application to move on to the next stage of development.Buildings  googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHowever, while there are plans in place for further development at the site, TEO has told the Derry News that no-one has been identied at present to occupy Buildings   which were recently vacated by Nerve Visual.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us. We will have a relaxed but enthralling evening as we look back at the glory days.While the spotlight will be on the Down legends, families from the Loughinisland Justice Group will be special guests at the event and their loved ones will be remembered during the night.Louise added: ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. A quarter of a century on from the massacre, we will think back on the impact of the Down win on the community, the uplt that the team brought and the footballing spirit which helped people through the darkest days. We have a lot of stories to hear.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the legendary silverware.Former Down and Loughinisland player Alan Molloy, who is also one of the organisers, said it was a remarkable feat that a small rural club like Loughinisland had three medals from the great teams of the s and their achievements had brought much joy and prestige to the club.He added: ldquoThis will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with these All-Ireland winners, including Loughinisland men Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, who gave so much to the county and continue to give so much to our club and community.ldquoGary Mason is the proud owner of two medals, from the victories in  and . Whilst Gerard Colgan was playing for An Riocht in , he spent the last of his playing days with Loughinisland. Both players are now passing on their valuable knowledge to the future generations through coaching our underage teams.ldquoThe club is very grateful that so many legends of the  team are ing to spend this evening with us.

There was a clearly much debate from the competitors about how muddy it was going to be andthey would have enough wet weather gear.As it turned out, the sun would appear and the rain would disappear leaving Lurgan Park looking beautully tranquil.The first race up was the U- race with Fiadh Kellett, Hugh and Conor Hetherington flying the flag for Dromara CC and more importantly loving the mud. Great to see them enjoying it.The U-s boysrsquo race saw young Oscar McBride loving the mud as he battled through the crown to claim eighth place in a competitive race.Aoe Kellett was in a tough U- girlsrsquo race that saw her put in a tremendous effort to claim third place with second place not far away. A great start to her league campaign and pressure on dad to produce in his race.James Armstrong has had a great summer of cycling and has taken this rich vein of form into the cyclo-cross. Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie.

It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time. The Irish Street proposal has the potential to transform the town centre, providing additional business for existing traders, Cllr Curran added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 By.jpg","title":"By George he’s got it as Bright come good  ","story":"THE long wait is over. Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo. Honest, resolute, determined and committed.Ryan McEvoy, Dylan Ward and Aaron Morgan should be tasked with winning the ball in the middle of the park and supplying Paul Devlin, Conor Laverty and the Johnston brothers Ryan and Jerome mdash not forgetting younger brother Shealan when he is called upon.Kilcoo also have serious strength on the bench and in addition to Johnston the younger, they can call on Anthony Morgan, Paddy Devlin, Sean OHanlon, James McClean and Felim McGreevy,.Warrenpoint have made their way through some tricky ties unbeaten and along the way have accounted for An Riocht , Ballyholland , Longstoneand Ballyholland in the semi-final, - to -.Manager Niall McAleenan has the nucleus of the squad that won the IFC title in  and has also introduced some talented teenagers.He will rely on Adam Lynch, Pat Murdock, Ryan McAleenan, John Boyle, Eoghan Byrne and Ciaran McCartan to keep the Kilcoo attack quiet, bit few defences ever manage it.The Point cant afford to play in a defensive manner come Sunday. They must attack Kilcoo and utilise their magical set of forwards.McAleenans men have shipped a lot of scores in the league and to invite Kilcoo on to them would not be advisable.Thats why going at Kilcoo from the off and getting top scorer Ross McGarry involved early on is essential.McGarry is the one player who has the ability and temperament to unsettle Kilcoo.He is not the biggest full forward in the game, but he has pace, bravery and rarely misses in front of goal.He is undoubtedly Warrenpoints ace in the pack and along with the Boyle brothers adds a touch of class to the Points challenge.McGarry relies heavily on Donagh McAleenan, Ruairi McCormick, Aaron Magee, Ryan Mallon and Ryan Boyle and this unit must be firing on all cylindersWarrenpoint are to cause a shock win.Kilcoo are red hot favourites at   with a generous   being offered on Warrenpoint.

The key issue we have to address is the presence of a wet weather centre in the resort which I would suggest includes a fun-type family pool, he said.ldquoI believe that alongside this there needs to be a few swimming lanes to accommodate the needs of local people who have not had access to modern leisure facilities for some considerable time.Cllr Clarke said this issue needed to be flagged up as part of the consultation process on the way forward.He said it was important that elected representatives highlighted the needs of local people during the process.ldquoWe are talking about a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a modern leisure facility in Newcastle and we will not be settling for less. The location is good and while there may be issues with parking, these are not insurmountable.ldquoWe are talking about a complete new build which will maximise the large area of space at the rear of the existing centre and I would be keen to see a high quality design, comprising wood and glass, he said.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an eco-friendly building, which is both sustainable and carbon neutral..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Planners.jpg","title":"Planners recommend expansion at Newcastle’s Barbican supermarket  ","story":"A LEADING Newcastle business is in line for a major extension.Planners are recommending that mdash subject to a number of conditions mdash an amended proposal to expand the Barbican filling station at the Dundrum Road in the resort should be given the green light.The approval recommendation is due to be discussed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Wednesday of next week.The proposal includes the redevelopment of the existing petrol station and forecourt and extending the storersquos retail space.

","story":"BALLYNAHINCH shook off their insipid displays in the SONI Premiership to push much-fancied Terenure right to the wire in their first appearance back in AIL Division A since .The Dublin outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change.

Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors.
