When they intensified a week later, her mother Alison noticed the pregnancy bump was moving and took her to hospital where doctors confirmed she was in labour.Amelia arrived – still in the amniotic sac – weighing 1lb 5oz, and Gethin followed shortly after at 1lb 6oz.They were taken to neonatal intensive care at Maelor Hospital, Wrexham, where teachers Miss Williams, 27, and Mr Jones, 32, kept a bedside vigil.The babies were wrapped in special plastic to keep them warm and hooked up to ventilators in incubators, which is when their parents saw them properly for the first time.‘It all moved so quickly,’ said Miss Williams. ‘Within minutes I was surrounded by 15 to 20 doctors and nurses. I was trying to be brave. I knew I had to be as calm as possible to give them the best chance of survival.’          Amelia holds her father’s finger: She was resuscitated after her heart rate fell. They were taken to neonatal intensive care where teachers Miss Williams and Mr Jones kept a bedside vigil          Gethin in intensive care: He had a bleed on the brain and a collapsed lung.

The newborns fought off sepsis and Amelia needed resuscitating when a heart valve that was not closing properly caused her heart rate to plummet. She later had laser eye surgery to save her sight.Gethin had a serious bleed on the brain and a collapsed lung.

We’d get calls in the middle of the night saying something else had happened, and urging us to get down to the ward. The sound of that phone still stays with me. It was so piercing, and we knew it was always bringing bad news.‘We were also surrounded by parents whose babies were sadly losing their fight, and having to console them, too. It was the hardest thing we’ll ever have to do.’ Now Amelia and Gethin share a special bond – playing, climbing and learning to speak English and Welsh together. They are due to start nursery in September.Miss Williams said: ‘Only now we’re out the other side of it do we realise how flabbergasting it is that the twins have escaped with very few issues. Nobody knows what drove them to survive – whether it was medicine, science, or just having Gareth and I there, willing them on.‘Everyone is amazed by their progress. They are so incredibly resilient.

Instead, he conned his way into a job with the \u0027British FBI\u0027 hunting fugitives – only to go on the run himself when he was finally found out.The 40-year-old was jailed for 18 months in his absence after gaining UK citizenship by lying to officials.Now the Mail has tracked down the former Scotland Yard and Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) intelligence officer to his bolthole in the seaside resort of Vlore in his homeland.He has spent six years there hiding from the UK authorities he once worked for – even boasting of his experience with the British police to gain security work in Albania. Ironically, Soca – now part of the National Crime Agency, nicknamed the British FBI – had been investigating Habilaj without realising he was one of its employees.The Albanian arrived in Britain in 1998, and claimed he was a Kosovan named Bekim Ademi. He said his brother had been tortured to death and his father killed by the Kosovan Liberation Army.It\u0027s time to set up migrant processing centres in AFRICA,...Radicalised asylum seekers have murdered or injured more...Share this articleBritish authorities believed him, and he was granted full asylum in November 2001, and citizenship five years later.He was hired by the Metropolitan Police and later Soca, where he worked as an intelligence officer in its London-based \u0027fugitive location team\u0027, helping to find suspected criminals wanted for extradition. He was finally unmasked after checking his own file on a work database of people of interest. Habilaj even called up a photo of himself on his computer screen in front of his boss.Belated checks revealed that he had been born in Albania rather than Kosovo, he never had a brother, and his father was alive and still living in his home town. After he absconded before his trial, Judge Martyn Zeidman QC issued a bench warrant, which instructs police to arrest Habilaj if he is traced. The warrants remain live and legally in force until the suspect is caught or voluntarily returns to face justice.          Habilaj has spent six years there hiding from the UK authorities he once worked forHabilaj was subsequently tried in his absence and jailed at Snaresbrook Crown Court in January 2013 after being convicted of obtaining leave to enter or remain in the UK by deception and fraud.The sentencing judge Simon Wilkinson said: \u0027He pretended to be a Kosovan and he was an Albanian who made up tales of atrocities to evoke sympathy.\u0027But he has successfully evaded British authorities, and this week we found him overseeing building work on a hotel he manages on the outskirts of Vlore.He also touts himself as a \u0027freelance security consultant\u0027 and boasts to locals of his time working for the British police – without revealing how his time in the UK came to an abrupt end.When approached by the Mail, Habilaj angrily demanded: \u0027Who has sent you? Who was it who brought you here?\u0027 He then ordered one of his building workers to chase us off the premises.Now a father of one, Habilaj boasts online that he has a degree and master\u0027s in criminology, and also claims to have written books on the subject.In a post written in Albanian and posted on Facebook in 2015, he described how he worked for the \u0027highest British agency against crime for almost two years.\u0027He added: \u0027Before that, I did work for the Metropolitan Police in London at its prestigious centre of Scotland Yard. It is an organisation dedicated to perfection and professionalism. I was one of them capable of doing the job, recruited for my academic achievements in the field of criminology.\u0027A spokesman for the National Crime Agency said: \u0027We continue to work with the Home Office in relation to this case.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/16/01/4D4617DA00000578-5850483-1916-a-122_1529109894608.jpg","title":"Maps New York shows stunning evolution","story":"    A map describing the town of Mannados, or New Amsterdam, as it was in September 1661.

His brilliant, fearless spirit touched and inspired so many, and his generosity knew no bounds. He was my love, my rock, my protector. I am beyond devastated. My thoughts are with his family. I would ask that you respect their privacy and mine.\u0027On Sunday, his mother Gladys told Page Six the family were awaiting approval from the French Government to return Bourdain\u0027s body to America, and were expecting it to take a few days.  The Parts Unknown host, 61, was found dead in his room at the Le Chambard hotel in France on Friday after hanging himself.Friend Eric Ripert, who had been helping the father-of-one make an upcoming episode of his show, was the one to make the grim discovery.          Anthony Bourdain has reportedly been cremated in France just days after he died by suicide          Bourdain and actress Asia Argento began dating a year after meeting in 2016He went to Bourdain\u0027s hotel room after he did not attend dinner or breakfast, which they were scheduled to eat together, where he found his friend had hanged himself.Christian de Rocquigny, the prosecutor of Colmar in France\u0027s eastern Alsace region, said on Saturday there did not appear to be much planning ahead of Bourdain\u0027s suicide.          Asia also shared a cryptic photo of her back with the word \u0027saved\u0027 superimposed on it\u0027There is no element that makes us suspect that someone came into the room at any moment,\u0027 he said, adding a medical expert had concluded that there were no signs of violence on Bourdain\u0027s body.Rocquigny said toxicology tests were being carried out on Bourdain\u0027s body, including urine tests, to see if he took any medications or other drugs, in an effort to help his family understand if anything led him to kill himself.Bourdain\u0027s funeral will be organised by his ex-wife, Ottavia, as she is still legally his next of kin, his mother Gladys has claimed.\u0027Although they\u0027re separated, she\u0027ll be in charge of whatever happens,\u0027 she said on Sunday. \u0027We haven\u0027t talked for a couple days. I\u0027m sure she\u0027s as broken up as I am.\u0027Ottavia was seen heading inside her New York home on Wednesday night, dressed casually in activewear and wearing sunglasses.The jiu-jitsu fanatic, and mother to Bourdain\u0027s only child, shared a photograph of the couples\u0027 11-year-old daughter Ariana on stage in a pair of knee-high studded boots on Monday.\u0027Our little girl had her concert today,\u0027 she wrote in the emotional caption. \u0027She was amazing. So strong and brave. She wore the boots you bought her. I hope you are having a good trip, wherever you are.\u0027           Argento (center right) spent Wednesday with actress and close friend Rose McGowan (left) and two other women  She shared pictures of herself listening to Jesus Was a Cross Maker, a song performed by a woman who committed suicide at the age of 35, on the same day her boyfriend was reportedly crematedMs Bourdain said she \u0027never would have dreamed\u0027 her son would commit suicide, though she knew he was in a bad place mentally in the days leading up to his death.His mother told The New York Times Ripert had contacted her and said Bourdain had been \u0027in a dark mood these past couple of days\u0027, but she said she still never saw his suicide coming.\u0027He had everything,\u0027 she said. \u0027Success beyond his wildest dreams. Money beyond his wildest dreams.\u0027But the celebrity chef opened up about his history of destructive behavior, including regular thoughts of suicide following the destruction of his marriage, in his 2011 book Medium Raw.After his first marriage to wife Nancy Putkoski ended in 2005, Bourdain recalled being \u0027aimless and regularly suicidal\u0027.During a stint in the Caribbean, he wrote of getting \u0027the kind of drunk where you\u0027ve got to put a hand over one eye to see straight\u0027 and would \u0027peel out\u0027 in his 4x4 for nightly trips to the brothels.Bourdain had also previously been open about his past struggles with drugs and spoke of being a recovering heroin addict.  Bourdain\u0027s estranged wife Ottavia (pictured) was seen heading into her New York apartment on Wednesday night          Busia has only recently broken her silence following Bourdain\u0027s death, and will be the one to organize his funeralIn addition to the celebrity chef\u0027s feats in the culinary world, he was also hailed for being one of the loudest male voices in the #MeToo movement. Argento has accused Harvey Weinstein of rape.          Bourdain\u0027s funeral will be organized by his estranged second wife Ottavia Busia Bourdain (pictured together in 2015)In an essay written after fellow chef Mario Batali was accused of sexual assault, Bourdain wrote that \u0027one must pick a side ... I stand unhesitatingly and unwaveringly with the women.\u0027 Argento wrote on Twitter on Friday that Bourdain \u0027was my love, my rock, my protector.\u0027It emerged this week that friends of the celebrity chef had begun to become concerned with his infatuation with Argento shortly before his death.\u0027He would have done anything for her, and that was a little red flag for some of his friends,\u0027 a source told People. \u0027Like, he was crazy in love with her, crazy being the keyword.\u0027Bourdain\u0027s longtime publicist for Parts Unknown, Karen Reynolds, told People that he seemed \u0027giddy\u0027 and was uncharacteristically communicative in the days in the run up to his suicide.Reynolds said he appeared to be delighted with his latest episode, filmed in Hong Kong and directed by Argento.\u0027He was so happy. I didn\u0027t talk to him this week but all I know was he was so happy last week. I mean giddy,\u0027 she said.\u0027He was texting me and emailing me which he doesn\u0027t normally do about publicity for episodes but he was like, \u0027This is a high water mark, this is the best thing I\u0027ve ever done.\u0027 He was so excited to be working with Christopher Doyle. I saw nothing that would indicate what happened. Like, why this would happen?\u0027We\u0027re just floored. A complete shock.\u0027The friend of Bourdain\u0027s told People that, while they knew he was overworked and struggling with the breakdown of his marriage, no one had any idea he\u0027d been suicidal.Anthony Bourdain \u0027is cremated in France after killing...Friends \u0027were worried about Anthony Bourdain\u0027s crazy love...\u0027F**k them all\u0027: Patton Oswalt shares Anthony Bourdain\u0027s...\u0027She wore the boots you bought her\u0027: Anthony Bourdain\u0027s ex...Share this article    Shining star: On Monday, Ottavia posted a photo of their 11-year-old daughter Ariana performing at a concert to Instagram (pictured), wearing the boots gifted to her by Bourdain           Bourdain, a father-of-one, was loud voice in the #MeToo campaign and was in a relationship with actress Asia Argento, who has leveled sexual assault claims towards Harvey Weinstein Anthony Bourdain\u0027s body stuck in France: momAnthony Bourdain, Renegade Chef Who Reported From the World¿s Tables, Is Dead at 61 - The New York Times"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/12/4D383CB000000578-0-image-m-26_1528974235806.jpg","title":"Prince Wales preparing add electric car royal fleet","story":"    Prince Charles and Kimbal Musk alongside the Tesla Model S electric car, which he test drove while hosting Mr Musk and his fiancee at Dumfries House in ScotlandClarence House told The Daily Telegraph: \u0027There is definitely a plan for us to incorporate electric cars into the royal fleet.\u0027The Prince of Wales was annoyed that people had been \u0027poking fun at him\u0027 about his concern for the environment, said Kimbal Musk, 45.He has previously spoken about the \u0027nightmare\u0027 of plastic waste pollution and finds it \u0027unbelievable\u0027 when people ask why tackling environmental issues must be a priority.German prince, 41, who moved to UK to marry his English...Fury as Prince Edward takes £6,000 taxpayer-funded private...Share this articleHis vehicles run on 100 per cent biodiesel made from used cooking oil and among the royal fleet is an Aston Martin Volante adjusted to use wine-based fuel in 2008.Clarence House organised the test drive with Tesla. the prince\u0027s head driver Tim Williams is thought to be planning a visit to a showroom to pick out an electric car.

As an atheist, I found it difficult to square my father’s intelligence with his embrace of what to me were religious fairy stories.Love and admiration aren’t synonymous, and can be at odds. The awe we had drilled into us was distancing. My father was already remote – often out of town, impatient when the dratted kids needed to pee, and distracted at dinner – from which he bolted, the better to get back to work.          Tilda Swinton starred in a film adaptation of Lionel Shriver\u0027s novel We Need To Talk About KevinHe always seemed to crave our reverence, when what he really needed was the opposite: affection, intimacy, and good-humoured ribbing.To have felt truly close to us, he’d have had to give up on bidding for a veneration that you should never expect from family, and isn’t much use, frankly, from anyone.You can’t feel known and revered at the same time.What has humanised Don Shriver, and greatly enriched his relationship with his two surviving kids, is the humbling of old age.He’s 90 now, and I can’t express how much it pains me to watch him inch tremulously across the living room, resting on his cane, holding on to chairs. Not long ago, he was still a vigorous man, splitting firewood into his 80s.When we were kids, he’d galumph down the street, head bent, scowling, planning his next speech.We couldn’t keep up with him. Now the challenge of keeping pace is walking that slowly. Of course, I’d rather his body decay than his mind. Fortunately, he can still rail cogently against Donald Trump, and I’ve laid down the law: he has to live long enough to see the back of that guy in the White House.I’m not grateful for his infirmity, but I am grateful for its effect. There’s a new tenderness to our relationship, on both sides.Once unheard of, he confides in me. My mother’s massive stroke means he’s often lonely.He needs me now, if only, as he says, for ‘someone to complain to’. He’s mortal. I prefer my father mortal.

But there are some hard facts that both sides are going to have to confront.ONE is that Theresa May misled the Remainers. A charitable interpretation is she did so unintentionally. A less charitable one is that she mugged them in an effort to save her own skin. But regardless of motive and method, on Tuesday Dominic Grieve and his allies believed their concerns would be fully addressed by a Government amendment, hence the 11th-hour withdrawal of their own. By accident or design, they were duped.RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: The Bad Boys of Brexit spoke for Britain...Blow for Philip Hammond as the PM plans to pour billions of...Share this articleWhat is equally apparent is that by tabling such a strongly worded motion, Grieve over-reached himself. Upholding the sacred right of Parliament to scrutinise legislation is one thing. But his text went way beyond that, stipulating that in the event of a deal being rejected by the Commons, the Prime Minister ‘must follow any direction in relation to the negotiation under Article 50’. That was an untenable demand. Setting aside the issue of centuries of constitutional precedent, the idea that MPs could elbow aside Ministers and begin setting the terms of negotiations themselves was utterly impractical.As one Government official scornfully noted: ‘We haven’t started the procurement process for a negotiating table around which it’s possible to fit 650 MPs.’Similarly, by presenting his amendment merely as a sensible contingency, only to be triggered in the event a no-deal scenario, Grieve was himself being uncharacteristically disingenuous.He knew full well that, if adopted, it would have emasculated David Davis and his Brexit negotiating team, giving their EU opposite numbers a clear incentive to simply stonewall the talks and await the cavalry from the Commons. Far from guarding against a no-deal scenario, it would have made a no-deal scenario a certainty.Grieve, Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan and their allies believe the end justifies these slightly underhand means. They genuinely think they represent the last line of defence against a kamikaze Brexit. And for that they deserve respect, not slurs about their patriotism or their parentage.But they are also wrong. The last line of defence against a kamikaze Brexit is Theresa May.The Prime Minister was pilloried last week for her negotiating stance. ‘A farce’ was one of the more polite descriptions from one Brexit-supporting newspaper.Even Downing Street insiders characterise their progress as ‘several steps forward, then a couple back’. But they also – correctly – point out that the overall direction of travel is consistent. Towards a sensible, pragmatic Brexit.For all the criticism she has received from Tory Remainers over the past few days, Mrs May has demonstrated time and again she too is prepared to stand up to her hard-Brexit zealots. Over the orce bill. Over the transition period. Over ECJ rulings during that transition. Over a customs arrangement. Indeed, not just stand up to them, but face them down, as Boris Johnson’s perennial frantic redrawing of his ‘red lines’ attests.But if the Prime Minister is undermined this week, then she will no longer be in a position to stand up to anyone. At that point a leadership challenge would almost certainly be mounted, one that if successful would result in the election of a far more Eurosceptic Tory leader.Or worse. The removal of Theresa May might give a brief moment of satisfaction to the Remain and hard-Brexit factions. But it would not break the Commons deadlock.And that is the real danger presented by the Grieve amendment. We are now on the cusp of entering a period of parliamentary purgatory. The Prime Minister attempts to negotiate a deal. The Commons rejects it. A new Prime Minister is dispatched to negotiate a new deal. That in turn is rejected. Tory – and moderate Labour – fears of a Corbyn government prevent a dissolution of the House and an early Election. And so the cycle repeats itself. At which point the Government ceases governing.          Nicky Morgan is one of the Tory rebels The country deserves better than this. As does Theresa May. Twelve months ago her premiership was over. The horrific fire at Grenfell, and catastrophic Election result, had created a perfect storm. In a matter of months Corbyn and his legion of White Walkers would be marching up Downing Street.BUT with the tenacity and bloody-mindedness that have become her trademark, the PM has stabilised her position. Labour’s lead in the polls has been reversed. The Corbynites’ crude attempt to leverage the Grenfell tragedy into a transitional political moment has failed. And, as we report today, a dramatic cash injection for the NHS demonstrates she is finally throwing off her instinctive caution, delivering the kind of major ‘visible from space’ policy announcements Ministers have been crying out for.Then there is Brexit. It has been an ugly process. But the Government is inching forward. David Davis has won the argument for publication of a Brexit White Paper. It will be signed off at next month’s Chequers away-day, after which it will form the basis of Mrs May’s official negotiating position.That’s if the Remain rebels stand with her. Last week the Prime Minister hurt them. But she is the Prime Minister, and they are not. And there is too much at stake for them to abandon her, and the country, now. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/15/15/4D44545200000578-5848029-image-m-29_1529072357825.jpg","title":"Four year old girls joy quickly turns regret rides big rollercoaster","story":"Little Lyla intially loved the ride with her mum, but it quickly turned to a grimace  At the top with the dip appearing, Lyla exclaims: \u0027Oh my god this is horrible!\u0027\u0027I\u0027m so glad I filmed it!\u0027 She added that Lyla took some persuading to go on the ride, with the family using the remainder of their tokens at the end of the day. \u0027After a minute or so of convincing her that it would be safe and fun, she bravely agreed. \u0027We wanted to seek some thrills and memories to last a lifetime, so I recorded it on my phone, but didn\u0027t expect her reaction at all. \u0027Everyone who has watched the video has found it hilarious and adorable.\u0027  As she squirms with horror at the speed the coaster is travelling, her mum Kara Leavell is in stitches of laughter next to her"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/15/21/4D48638D00000578-5849991-image-a-12_1529096380845.jpg","title":"Little wonders Toddler twins born 24 weeks","story":"    Full of life: Twins Amelia and Gethin will be three next monthThe couple, from Wrexham, had initially dismissed back pains Miss Williams had been experiencing as part of the pregnancy.

It was the hardest thing we’ll ever have to do.’ Now Amelia and Gethin share a special bond – playing, climbing and learning to speak English and Welsh together. They are due to start nursery in September.Miss Williams said: ‘Only now we’re out the other side of it do we realise how flabbergasting it is that the twins have escaped with very few issues. Nobody knows what drove them to survive – whether it was medicine, science, or just having Gareth and I there, willing them on.‘Everyone is amazed by their progress. They are so incredibly resilient.

He was finally unmasked after checking his own file on a work database of people of interest.

After he absconded before his trial, Judge Martyn Zeidman QC issued a bench warrant, which instructs police to arrest Habilaj if he is traced. The warrants remain live and legally in force until the suspect is caught or voluntarily returns to face justice.

It is believed she has already done so.Local reports earlier this week said one of the men - thought to be Ahearne-Grant - told police and the judge he was in another room with the alleged victim\u0027s friend and got involved in an altercation with the other two men after hearing noise and going to investigate.Cala de Bou, which is in the municipality of San Jose, is a popular location for tourists looking to stay somewhere quieter than San Antonio but within easy reach of the brash party resort.It is just seven miles from the airport and home to a number of hotels and short-stay holiday apartments.Ahearne-Grant, born in Greenwich is a forward who signed with League One side Charlton as a 17-year-old in September 2014.He has made more than 60 appearances with the club in Championship and League One football and has played for England at U17, U18 and U19.Redbridge-born Hackett-Fairchild made his professional debut with Charlton in August last year, and hit the net twice in 12 appearances.He has previously spent time with Dagenham \u0026amp Redbridge and Dulwich Hamlet.A Charlton Athletic spokesman said: \u0027The club have been made aware and are looking into this matter.\u0027Due to the ongoing investigation we will not be commenting any further at this stage.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/23/0071A26D1000044C-0-image-a-29_1528325518311.jpg","title":"Stansted Guards 10 minute rounds wake dozing passengers bosses enforce sleep BAN","story":"    Stansted Airport has banned passengers from sleeping on seats and appointed \u0027anti-snooze\u0027 guards to to patrol terminals every ten minutes to wake people upWarning signs have also been posted around the Essex airport asking travellers \u0027Please do not lay down on the seats.\u0027However, many passengers have called in \u0027unfair\u0027 and say the treatment is \u0027mean\u0027 to tired travellers.The policy, which began on Monday, sees the departure wing being closed after the final flight of the night. Plane crazy?

As an atheist, I found it difficult to square my father’s intelligence with his embrace of what to me were religious fairy stories.Love and admiration aren’t synonymous, and can be at odds. The awe we had drilled into us was distancing. My father was already remote – often out of town, impatient when the dratted kids needed to pee, and distracted at dinner – from which he bolted, the better to get back to work.

But there are some hard facts that both sides are going to have to confront.ONE is that Theresa May misled the Remainers. A charitable interpretation is she did so unintentionally. A less charitable one is that she mugged them in an effort to save her own skin. But regardless of motive and method, on Tuesday Dominic Grieve and his allies believed their concerns would be fully addressed by a Government amendment, hence the 11th-hour withdrawal of their own. By accident or design, they were duped.RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: The Bad Boys of Brexit spoke for Britain...Blow for Philip Hammond as the PM plans to pour billions of...Share this articleWhat is equally apparent is that by tabling such a strongly worded motion, Grieve over-reached himself. Upholding the sacred right of Parliament to scrutinise legislation is one thing. But his text went way beyond that, stipulating that in the event of a deal being rejected by the Commons, the Prime Minister ‘must follow any direction in relation to the negotiation under Article 50’. That was an untenable demand. Setting aside the issue of centuries of constitutional precedent, the idea that MPs could elbow aside Ministers and begin setting the terms of negotiations themselves was utterly impractical.As one Government official scornfully noted: ‘We haven’t started the procurement process for a negotiating table around which it’s possible to fit 650 MPs.’Similarly, by presenting his amendment merely as a sensible contingency, only to be triggered in the event a no-deal scenario, Grieve was himself being uncharacteristically disingenuous.He knew full well that, if adopted, it would have emasculated David Davis and his Brexit negotiating team, giving their EU opposite numbers a clear incentive to simply stonewall the talks and await the cavalry from the Commons. Far from guarding against a no-deal scenario, it would have made a no-deal scenario a certainty.Grieve, Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan and their allies believe the end justifies these slightly underhand means. They genuinely think they represent the last line of defence against a kamikaze Brexit. And for that they deserve respect, not slurs about their patriotism or their parentage.But they are also wrong. The last line of defence against a kamikaze Brexit is Theresa May.The Prime Minister was pilloried last week for her negotiating stance. ‘A farce’ was one of the more polite descriptions from one Brexit-supporting newspaper.Even Downing Street insiders characterise their progress as ‘several steps forward, then a couple back’. But they also – correctly – point out that the overall direction of travel is consistent. Towards a sensible, pragmatic Brexit.For all the criticism she has received from Tory Remainers over the past few days, Mrs May has demonstrated time and again she too is prepared to stand up to her hard-Brexit zealots. Over the orce bill. Over the transition period. Over ECJ rulings during that transition. Over a customs arrangement. Indeed, not just stand up to them, but face them down, as Boris Johnson’s perennial frantic redrawing of his ‘red lines’ attests.But if the Prime Minister is undermined this week, then she will no longer be in a position to stand up to anyone. At that point a leadership challenge would almost certainly be mounted, one that if successful would result in the election of a far more Eurosceptic Tory leader.Or worse. The removal of Theresa May might give a brief moment of satisfaction to the Remain and hard-Brexit factions. But it would not break the Commons deadlock.And that is the real danger presented by the Grieve amendment. We are now on the cusp of entering a period of parliamentary purgatory. The Prime Minister attempts to negotiate a deal. The Commons rejects it. A new Prime Minister is dispatched to negotiate a new deal. That in turn is rejected. Tory – and moderate Labour – fears of a Corbyn government prevent a dissolution of the House and an early Election. And so the cycle repeats itself. At which point the Government ceases governing.          Nicky Morgan is one of the Tory rebels The country deserves better than this. As does Theresa May. Twelve months ago her premiership was over. The horrific fire at Grenfell, and catastrophic Election result, had created a perfect storm. In a matter of months Corbyn and his legion of White Walkers would be marching up Downing Street.BUT with the tenacity and bloody-mindedness that have become her trademark, the PM has stabilised her position. Labour’s lead in the polls has been reversed. The Corbynites’ crude attempt to leverage the Grenfell tragedy into a transitional political moment has failed. And, as we report today, a dramatic cash injection for the NHS demonstrates she is finally throwing off her instinctive caution, delivering the kind of major ‘visible from space’ policy announcements Ministers have been crying out for.Then there is Brexit. It has been an ugly process. But the Government is inching forward. David Davis has won the argument for publication of a Brexit White Paper. It will be signed off at next month’s Chequers away-day, after which it will form the basis of Mrs May’s official negotiating position.That’s if the Remain rebels stand with her. Last week the Prime Minister hurt them. But she is the Prime Minister, and they are not. And there is too much at stake for them to abandon her, and the country, now. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d29b52a76400ed4cb435655a47adaac60ce36e/503_175_3003_1802/master/3003.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bd52b446d7c38f329a272dd15cc588a","title":"big picture dagmar hochova two on a bridge czechoslovakia","story":"It is 50 years since the Prague spring, that expression of rebellion and love in the Czech capital that ended in August 1968 with Russian tanks on the streets and another generation of Soviet repression. Dagmar Hochová took photographs that captured all of the hopes and fears of the long postwar struggle for freedom in her country, which culminated in the Velvet Revolution of 1989.Hochová was born in 1926 and lived most of her life in Prague until her death in 2012. Though her pictures were sometimes overtly political – the young, ostracised Václav Havel, at home the “march of silence” against the Russian invasion – Hochová became best known as a photographer of children. This was partly a question of expedience. Childhood was one of the few aspects of the city’s life that was effectively beyond the censor’s control. Hochová’s camera sought out the mischief and spirit of Czech kids playing in the streets. The exuberance she was drawn to was no doubt a statement of subversive intent at a time when freedom of expression was outlawed – there was also plenty of pure innocent joy.This picture, part of the first UK retrospective of Hochová’s work, captures all of that youthful Bohemian spirit. It was taken on a bridge over the Vltava River in 1959. After the Russian coup in 1948 there had been long years of Stalinist purges of artists and agitators, and the creation of all the grey apparatus of a police state, but that world seems far removed from these two girls.

He had been commissioned by the festival to do a work within the precinct of Chapel Street, a main street known for upmarket fashion stores and restaurants, and which runs through the south-east suburbs of South Yarra, Prahran and Windsor.Tunick’s plan to photograph about 350 naked people on the rooftop carpark of Woolworths in Prahran was temporarily thwarted after the supermarket declined him access. The number of people involved means that Tunick will also need to get up high to take the photograph and capture the scene.“I’m very happy and lucky that Woolworths is now allowing me to go ahead with this art event for the people of Melbourne, because there was no plan B.”He said the supermarket came around to the idea after a less busy day of the week was proposed.In a statement a Woolworths spokesperson said Tunick would have access to the car park for one hour on a Monday morning. It followed an online petition protesting against the supermarket’s original decision.“It’s a good outcome that will allow Spencer Tunick to profile the Chapel Street precinct on the world stage without compromising the ability of our customers to access the store, in an easy and convenient manner,” the spokesperson said.Tunick said an hour would be plenty of time.“You know, an hour is a long time for people to be naked in cold weather,” he said. “Some of my best works in New York were made in under 15 minutes and with the threat of arrest.”About 11,000 people have registered to take part in the shoot. Successful applicants will be notified. Tunick said he did not want to give too much away about what he planned to do with participants on the rooftop.“We are now still waiting for confirmation on other aspects of the art installation but those aspects don’t require permissions,” he said. The shoot will take place on 9 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a149f83bad08686d7e62f5ffeef2631ec2da45d3/0_716_6943_4166/master/6943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c9923ede7e01621e50161a13223b76d","title":"field day festival drawings in pictures","story":"Earlier this month, London-based artist Joey Yu headed to Field Day, a two-day music festival held in south London’s Brockwell Park, to record the action with crayons, pencils and paper.

A forbidden message would always find a route through to its destination.Gilmore’s adage became a key part of the techno-utopian creed in the 1980s and early 1990s. It suggested that neither the state nor the corporate world would be able to censor cyberspace. The unmistakable inference was that the internet posed an existential threat to authoritarian regimes, for whom control of information is an essential requirement for holding on to power.In the analogue world, censorship was relatively straightforward. It merely required state control of all the main communications media – print, radio and television – plus fear of draconian punishment for anyone daring to circumvent the resulting restrictions on information citizens were allowed to see. The 20th century provided numerous instances of how this worked – in fascist dictatorships, the Soviet empire and Mao’s China, for example – and how effective it could be in the pre-digital age.Although much has changed since those dark days, it remains true that the internet (as distinct from the web) is still very difficult to censor. And yet – despite that – authoritarian regimes are flourishing. How come?The answer, in a nutshell, is that they have sharpened up their act. In the process, some have displayed remarkable insights into the nature and affordances of network technology, insights that some democratic governments still don’t seem to appreciate. And at the cutting edge of the new approach to censorship that has emerged is – surprise, surprise! – the People’s Republic of China.In 2015, commenting on the fact that Chinese internet users generated 30bn pieces of information a day, a former director of the country’s state internet information office observed that “it is not possible to apply censorship to this enormous amount of data. Thus censorship is not the correct word choice. But no censorship does not mean no management.”Note that last sentence. The quote comes from a remarkable new book – Censored: Distraction and Diversion Inside China’s Great Firewall – by Margaret Roberts, one of a number of dedicated scholars who have for some years being studying how the Chinese regime is “managing” the internet. What these scholars have been unearthing is a detailed picture of “networked authoritarianism” (to use the academic Rebecca MacKinnon’s term) in action. Roberts’s book is a magisterial summary of what we have learned so far.In essence, the Chinese approach is a combination of technocratic realism and political nous. It accepts that, in the end, Gilmore’s axiom still applies, but not the techno-utopian conclusion that effective censorship is therefore impossible. It just needs to be updated for a digital age.Censorship 2.0 is based on the idea that there are three ways of achieving the government’s desire to keep information from the public – fear, friction and flooding. Fear is the traditional, analogue approach. It works, but it’s expensive, intrusive and risks triggering a backlash andor the “Streisand effect” – when an attempt to hide a piece of information winds up drawing public attention to what you’re trying to\u0026nbsphide (after the singer tried to suppress photographs of her Malibu home in 2003).Friction involves imposing a virtual “tax” (in terms of time, effort or money) on those trying to access censored information. If you’re dedicated or cussed enough you can find the information eventually, but most citizens won’t have the patience, ingenuity or stamina to persevere in the search. Friction is cheap and unobtrusive and enables plausible denial (was the\u0026nbspinformation not available because of a technical glitch or user\u0026nbsperror?).Flooding involves deluging the citizen with a torrent of information – some accurate, some phoney, some biased – with the aim of making people overwhelmed. In a digital world, flooding is child’s play: it’s cheap, effective and won’t generate backlash. (En passant, it’s what Russia – and Trump – do.)In her book, Roberts provides abundant evidence of how the Chinese authorities deploy these three techniques. She also suggests that other authoritarian regimes are now taking lessons from the Beijing playbook. This is significant because there are only two systems of governance left in our world: some version of liberal – or, as in Hungary – illiberal democracy and the Chinese model of networked authoritarianism. Up to now, we in the west – high on Francis Fukuyama’s “end of history” narrative – have tended to assume that our system would triumph and that digital technology would help make that happen. The Chinese take a different view. And in the end they may have the last laugh.Poisoned penReddit and the Struggle to Detoxify the Internet: a terrific, thoughtful New Yorker essay by Andrew Marantz on the perennial question of how we fix life online without limiting free speech.What’s not to like?Frederic Filloux’s Medium post on Facebook’s biggest strategic concern: teenagers appear to be abandoning it.

Yet a country that boasts of giving the world free parliaments feels little obligation to even look at allegations that Russia subverted British democracy. The government and opposition are compromised and want the scandal closed down. As does an embarrassed rightwing press and a shamefully negligent BBC.I’ll leave you to read our pieces on the contacts between Russia and Leave campaign, the ties that bind Banks and Farage to Trump to Steve Bannon and to Russia, and the offers from the Russians to Banks of a stake in a goldmine. (Whatever it does to the rest of us, Brexit may not leave Mr Banks poorer.) One issue remains: a campaign that purported to be for the “left-behind” was organised and funded by men with links across the global network of oligarchs and kleptomaniac dictators.We know that Russia has interfered in elections in North America and Europe. Russia had a direct interest in promoting Brexit because it would destabilise a strategic rival. (Anyone who doubts me need only look at how Brexit has brought Whitehall close to collapse.) We know too that the Electoral Commission referred Banks’ campaign to the police for alleged “unlawful overspending” and has raised urgent questions about the behaviour of Boris Johnson and Michael Gove’s supposedly “respectable” alternative, Vote Leave.Shouldn’t we be following the money? If you rely on our supposed public service broadcasters, you would not know there is money to run after. LBC has given Farage a platform to propagate his special pleading. In apparent contravention of broadcasting impartiality regulations, LBC allowed him to cut off Cadwalladr when she challenged him. “LBC: Leading Britain’s Conversation” runs its motto. But it silences the conversation when it turns to the financing of Brexit.The BBC, meanwhile, has more journalists than any other news organisation in Europe. Given its dominance, it is almost true to say that news isn’t news until the BBC acknowledges its existence. For months, its editors have not let its reporters cover Russia-Brexit. They can report on Trump’s links to Russia – and I suppose we should be grateful for that – but not on evidence of the subversion of the electoral process in the country whose taxes fund them.Panorama has backed away twice from covering the story. If the BBC mentions the scandal at all, it pretends it’s a game. Andrew Marr and the Today programme have both tried to titillate their audiences with catfights between Carol Cadwalladr and Banks and Lord Ashcroft’s mouthpiece, Isabel Oakeshott. But it will not investigate itself. I think I can guess why. Journalism is hard work, complex and, if the job is well done, its conclusions won’t make comfortable listening for ideological factions and moneyed interests with the wealth to hire libel lawyers from Mishcon de Reya.The usual complaint against the BBC is that if someone says the world is round, it will scour the country to find a guest to argue that it’s flat. The corporation’s behaviour on the Brexit scandal is more disturbing than the usual fetishisation of balance, however. The BBC has given up on journalism itself because it is frightened of what its reporters might find. It has reduced public service broadcasting to a modern version of the Roman circus: a game that stops the plebs worrying their little heads about the future of their country. I’ve defended the BBC against Scottish nationalists, Corybnistas, remainers and the Brexit right. But how can anyone defend a BBC whose executives and presenters prefer manufactured stunts to reporting? On the Brexit scandal the BBC offers something worse than fake news: it offers no news. The broadcasters are a true reflection of a compromised political system. The National Crime Agency, Serious Fraud Office and intelligence agencies ought to be investigating whether democracy was subverted. You only have to raise that possibility to realise the objections. The Tories are committed to Brexit. They will not push for investigations into allegations of collusion by a Brexit campaign whose wishes they are now meeting.In the US, opposition Democrats naturally want Trump’s every dealing with Russia exposed. But in Britain the leaders of the opposition Labour party are as anxious as Farage and Theresa May to change the subject. Never forget the far left’s soft spot for thieving autocrats. Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman Seumas Milne flew to Sochi to doff his cap to Putin. Emily Thornberry defends Russia’s Syrian policy as reliably as Arron Banks. Leaving its attraction to dictators to one side, if you can, the London far left is in a marriage of convenience with the northern Labour right. Both are determined to stop free movement and keep Britain out of the single market. For reasons of ideology and electoral calculation, we have an opposition that will not oppose.Can you begin to see why the scandal is not a scandal? In any other country there would be uproar, but here the Tory and Labour frontbenches must pretend there’s nothing to see. I’ll leave you with the Elizabethan poet Sir John Harington, who explained how Russia has Britain where it wants it far better than the BBC, when he said:Treason doth never prosper? What’s the Reason?For if it prosper none dare call it treason.

Here’s where to kick off your tour of some of the little nations on the UK’s doorstep.Channel your inner ScandiIkea, Noma and Pernille Teisbaek all have their part to play in the UK’s obsession with Scandi-inspired interiors, food, fashion and, well, just about everything – and our love affair shows no sign of waning. Whether you’re in Manchester’s Northern Quarter or Bristol’s up-and-coming Montpelier neighbourhood, it is possible to find little pockets of Copenhagen or Stockholm in a growing number of UK cities. The Scandinavian population of London is also on the up, with favourite Scandi hangouts clustered around the Marylebone area, near to the Swedish church. Here, you can unwind over fika – a coffee and bun break – at the Nordic Bakery, where you can also pick up rye bread and other treats. Head to Totally Swedish for food and other knick-knacks, which are, yes, totally Swedish.

Stand beside the 17th-century houses in Pittenweem harbour and it will look like you’re in Belgium – the steeped gables and pantile roofs will give your photos a feel that is not typically Scottish. At the end of your architecture trawl, head to the village of Crail where boats will be bringing in their catch of crabs and lobster – at the Lobster Hut you can buy them cooked and dressed and eat alfresco on the harbour wall. Get there early if you don’t want to miss out on the lobster or crab rolls.Search for homes on Airbnb in Flemish-inspired FifeFall in love with the City of LightsBlackpool Tower, built between 1891 and 1894, was originally inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, but these days it is more famously known as the place where the television show Strictly Come Dancing comes to put on a grand display. Get a snap of yourself holding the tower in the palm of your hand by posing farther down the promenade and then return to the famous ballroom to try out your waltz, paso doble and cha-cha-cha. Cap it all off with some kitsch souvenirs – a kiss-me-quick hat or a stick of Blackpool rock. And as the sun goes down – and if you are visiting between 31 August and 4 November – walk along the beachfront during the Blackpool Illumination, for a dazzling display of lights.Search for homes on Airbnb near the bright lights of BlackpoolGo back in time to Roman EnglandEngland’s most famous wall, dating back to the 2nd century, once marked the distinction between north and south. Now a Unesco world heritage site, and one of England’s greatest landmarks, Hadrian’s Wall threads along almost 80 miles from coast to coast, running from the river Tyne to the Solway Firth. It is the best-preserved frontier of the Roman empire, which ruled much of England for almost 400 years. Along the wall you will find the Roman town of Corbridge, and Roman temples and forts – as well as some incredible homes to stay in.Search for homes on Airbnb in historic NorthumberlandFind Little JamaicaWant to get your jerk on? Then look no farther than London’s Brixton, with a thriving Jamaican community, who’ve been in the area for seven decades. It’s here that you can get that hit of herbs and spices on the barbecue, as long-marinated chicken, pork and goat sizzle on the grill. You’ll find music all around you as you wander between boutiques and food emporiums, with Jamaican flags at every turn. Head to Bamboula or Negril for authentic saltfish with ackee (a buttery tasting fruit), or festival (cornmeal dumplings), and later after a night on the tiles, Refill serves up everything from stew made from cow foot and beans, to callaloo dumplings (made with a leafy vegetable) until the early hours.Search for homes on Airbnb near London’s cool BrixtonExperience Manchester’s ChinatownStand under the famous arch in Chinatown, Manchester, and you could almost be in any major city in China. It’s been there for more than 30 years and is adorned with dragons and phoenixes that will make your pictures look like you have travelled much farther than the north of England.

Head to south London’s Stockwell area, where you will find cafes and restaurants serving Portuguese food. There is a huge Portuguese community in this part of London – the largest outside the country itself. Check out Madeira cafe, which sells cakes and pastries, and has a bakery that makes 20,000 pastéis de nata per day, to be sent out across London. Or head to Sintra delicatessen, which sells everything from Portuguese sweets to cheeses and chorizo sausages.

Sofia Genders, co-founder of End of the Road Festival and Sheffield insider, has your ultimate 48-hour guide to the cityDay one – yoga, shopping and arty hangoutsExplore what Sheffield’s buzzing neighbourhoods have to offer. Spend the morning getting to know the hip, leafy suburb of Nether Edge – start with a yoga class at Hot Yoga Sheffield on Edgedale Road, then grab a healthy smoothie at the Wild Leaf cafe next door. Yoga was such a great stress-buster when I was running End of the Road festival, and it never fails to put me in a great frame of mind, whether I’m working or enjoying a day off.Next, take a stroll to nearby Abbeydale Road, also known as the antiques quarter. On the first Sunday of the month this vintage wonderland of a street also hosts a flea market at the Abbeydale Picture House – a gorgeous old venue that regularly screens black-and-white early cinema and hosts various cultural events. Spend some time wandering around the Vaults to find something special among the weird and wonderful retro items, or try the eclectic Rileys \u0026amp Co for vintage furniture, kitsch collectables and local crafts. I also love finding bargains in charity shops – there are quite a few along Abbeydale Road. Sticking with the retro theme, a visit to Jameson’s Cafe \u0026amp Tea Rooms is my all-time favourite afternoon tea spot, with great service and a live pianist. Two minutes walk down the road, there’s a great secondhand record store called Below. Also close by on Nether Edge Road, is the intimate and laid back Cafe #9 – perfect for a pick-me-up, plus they host live music now and again.As the afternoon rolls on, head to the villagey Sharrow Vale Road, where you can browse independent shops, delis and boutiques – such as the Front Parlour or Porter Book Shop – before grabbing an artisan doughnut and coffee from Eve Kitchen.If you need something more substantial, you could grab a late lunch from Porter Pizza on Sharrow Vale Road, probably the best pizza in town. It’s takeaway-only but the gorgeous Endcliffe Park is just around the corner, and is a top spot for a pizza picnic and a quick post-lunch stroll around the beautiful woodland.Alternatively, hop in a cab to Chesterfield Road in the up-and-coming Meersbrook area. Here, vegans are in luck: Make No Bones restaurant on Chesterfield Road is a true local’s favourite, or Just Falafs, on the same street, is a great fallback. That’s not to say that carnivores aren’t also well catered for in the area. I also really love the Tramshed Bar \u0026amp Kitchen – they’ve got a brilliant Asian menu, or you could just pop into the bar for a drink or two.Speaking of drinks, in the evening, Takk bar on Queens Road, Heeley, right on the edge of Sheffield city centre, is a great place for a dance and a cocktail in a fairy lit garden. You’ll find it in Hagglers Corner, a creative courtyard community of artists and independent makers, which doubles as an arts venue. If pubs are more your thing, the Brothers Arms and the Sheaf View are both nearby and have a reputation for top quality real ale.If you’re after a gig, try the Audacious Art Experiment, the eponymous venue of the local record label, on Harwood Street. Alternatively, head back to Abbeydale Road and check out Picture House Social, for an eclectic line-up of music events, with great cocktails, craft beer, Italian-inspired street food and a games room, too. I’m a big fan of small, independent venues with creative programming as they’re vital to a healthy music industry – both are destinations for the in-the-know crowd and have some great shows on.Day two – coffee, cake and creative curationThe second day is when you’ll find out what the city centre has to offer, plus a visit to Kelham Island, a riverside area that was once the central hub of Sheffield’s industry, and one of the oldest sites of its kind in the city.Start your day with a good coffee. There are so many great places to choose from, depending on where you are based. Tamper is a New Zealand coffee place with an industrial feel – its main outpost is housed in a 19th-century former silversmith workshop on Arundel Street. On the same street is the Holt, a true hidden gem of a coffee place, while tucked away on Aberdeen Court is Steam Yard, with a cosy feel and amazing cakes.Spend the rest of your morning checking out some of the best shops the city has to offer – in particular stroll along Division Street and the surrounding roads. Syd and Mallory sells the best handmade clothing and reworked fashion. La Biblioteka is a great little bookshop stocking a massive range of magazines and books from independent publishers, plus stationery. When I’m looking for good music, I often discover something new and fresh at Bear Tree Records – a lovely shop that sells both new and secondhand vinyl.While you wander, keep your eyes peeled. Sheffield is full of great street art, sculpture, graffiti and wall murals by local artists such as Jo Peel, Faunagraphic, Phlegm and more. Street Art Sheffield lists many of the sites if you’d like to plan ahead. One of my favourite sculptures is the Women of Steel by Martin Jennings outside City Hall. It commemorates the women who worked in the city’s steel industry during the first and second world wars.After a morning stroll, stop for lunch at Dina Diner, a vegetarian and vegan cafe attached to a music, comedy, poetry and theatre venue that is a social enterprise and platform for emerging artists. Dina is an example of what I like about most of Sheffield’s creative spaces: the really thoughtful curation. Similarly, Gloam Gallery is another great space dedicated to creativity. Gloam’s Instagram is exciting and exhibitions here are fresh and unusual. In September, the Site Gallery will also be re-opening – another great creative space to check out.For dinner head to Kelham Island and the cosy, neighbourhood restaurant Stew and Oyster. Later in the evening, check out the Delicious Clam – a record label and an unmissable DIY venue where you’re guaranteed to hear something interesting and underground. A lot of bands start out there and it’s worth catching a show if you can. Something entirely different is Public, a recently-opened cocktail bar in a converted old public toilet – it’s another small venue, and really worth it.Last but not least, be sure to check out what is one of the best railway station pubs in the country – the Sheffield Tap, a place where my husband and I love to sit and watch the world go by. Located within the old first-class waiting room, this pub is also a microbrewery and has a great selection of craft beers. Enjoy and don’t worry if you miss your train home as Sheffield has more than enough to offer for further adventures.

In fact, with its fixie bikes, cobbled streets, Noma-ish foraged cuisine and design-first ethos, it almost feels like a pocket of Copenhagen that just happens to be a 90-minute train ride from London. Throw in the refurbished 1920s theme park Dreamland and it all adds up to an irresistible artist’s enclave for a weekend city. Armed with effusive recommendations from my Airbnb host Clare – a trend-forecaster and trainee florist ­– I set about experiencing the best of the Kentish coast’s new capital of cool. Here’s my guide to getting the best out of a trip to this unique seaside town.Follow the foodie trailThe seafront chippies are still drawing crowds (and e-bombing seagulls) but in recent years, Margate’s culinary scene has evolved. Open since 2015, Hantverk \u0026amp Found is a seafood cafe and gallery that exemplifies that uptick in quality, whether you’re after a big last-night-of-the-trip dinner or a casual lunch slurping local rock oysters spiked with yuzu (a citrus fruit) in the suntrap garden. The food is unfussy and brightly flavoured – think clams in a spicy Korean broth and bream with a heady brown shrimp butter. The dinky emerald-tiled room adds a lively, squashed-in thrum to proceedings.For a legendary cheese toastie, and great rooftop views for sunset, head to Cheesy Tiger on the jutting Harbour Arm, my Airbnb host advises. There’s also friendly little Fez bar, a quirky, eclectic boozer close by. Or for an array of beachfront eating and drinking options, then the The Bus Cafe – with its crammed and zingy salad wraps – and the adjacent Sun Deck, are the places to head to. “There’s a really good juice bar, Po’ Boy that does great Creole-style food, and a cool tiki bar,” says Ed Warren, local and co-founder of Cliffs record shop and cafe.Sound out local musicThere aren’t many cafes where you can watch an experimental radio show broadcasting to the world and have a flat white made by a double Mercury Music prize-winning nominee. A labour of love for musician Obara Ejimiwe (aka Ghostpoet) and his creative director wife Kate, Radio Margate is a hybrid coffee shop, late-night venue and internet radio station launched in 2017 following their move from London. This sea-view space – all calming jazz and tasteful mid-century furniture – is, according to the Ejimiwes, a direct result of Margate’s contagious creative energy. “It’s totally infectious and there’s more room here to develop strong, independent ideas,” Obara says.Housed in a lovingly restored former 1920s tearoom in Cliftonville, Cliffs is a record shop that also encompasses a fitness studio, coffee roastery, hair salon, gig venue and an exceptional cafe (try the harissa oil and avocado toast). “I just wanted to sell Motown records but we got caught up in it all, like a lot of people here do,” says owner Ed Warren, explaining how he and his interior designer partner Kier Muddiman found themselves presiding over this artfully-distressed cultural fiefdom. “All these interesting little places in Margate are from the heart, basically.”Hit refreshWalpole Bay tidal pool is a must for lovers of outdoor swimming. It is the UK’s largest saltwater bathing pool, covering 4 acres (1.6 hectares), and was built in 1937. A group of locals swear by a regular swim in this beautiful coastal location, which fills up at high tide each day. “The first time I jumped in I squealed with excitement as the cold water engulfed me,” says Kathryn Ferguson, Margate resident and director of Taking the Waters, a short film about the pool. “But it felt exhilarating and from that moment I was totally hooked. A full moon swim is something I’d recommend everyone to try once.”Sticking with the theme of wellness, it’s worth stopping by natural fragrance and skincare company Haeckels to pick up a few restorative products to take home. One of the town’s most famous success stories, it was founded by Dom Bridges, a former film director who turned a hobby making soap from foraged Margate seaweed into a brand stocked in Harvey Nichols. Still, little can prepare you for the surprise of its flagship laboratory, shop and sea-based thalassotherapy spa, high up on a blustery Cliftonville parade. “It’s an example of the fact that each business has an amazing story of its own,” says Shelly Keeys, owner of shrewdly curated local fashion store Ruskin.Shop independent art and designThose that know their parlour palms from their succulents will feel at home in the jungle interior of Mar Mar, a cafe, gift shop and houseplant emporium on Northdown Road. Bolstering the town’s roster of design boutiques (homewares store Môr is worth a look too), it grew from Central St Martins graduate Boe Holder’s bold, Memphis Group-influenced creations. “She used to do pot painting and sell these great plant pots online,” says Margate-based photographer Harriet Bentley. “Now they’re selling plants, coffee, magazines and other great little things. It’s so cool.”Other interiors shops worth seeking out include: Clayspace Studios, a social enterprise and ceramics store Danish Collectables for curated Scandinavian vintage pieces Papillon Interiors for vibrant indoor and outdoor furniture and Imagineican Store, a tiny design and lifestyle studio. If you hire a bike during your trip, Westgate-on-sea is about a 15-minute cycle from Margate’s seafront, and is home to Eighty Two Westgate.Of course, one of the biggest draws in town for art is the Turner Contemporary, which opened in 2011 and sowed the first seeds for the current regenerative flowering.

The Glasgow School of Art, the working testament to the genius of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was engulfed in flames once more four years after a devastating fire had threatened the fabled Mac building. Its £35m re-birth following years of meticulous craftsmanship was only months away the scaffolding which had been its temporary sarcophagus was being dismantled. Now fire service chiefs are preparing Glasgow for the worst.Four years ago the over-riding emotion was one of grief. Mackintosh’s building, sitting at the top of one of Glasgow’s many elevated boulevards, was a source of fierce pride that carried well beyond the artists and teachers who called it home. If any stonework could ever be described as delicate it was Mackintosh’s in this building. Perhaps an awareness of this fragility lay near the root of Glaswegians’ curious love for this building. Once you had seen it you felt you shared in a communal duty of care towards it. Even those who had never set foot in it – nor are ever likely to – knew about this place and knew it needed to be protected.The sense of loss and sadness that was apparent in May 2014 was assuaged by waves of sympathy from all over the world. This perhaps shielded the school’s custodians from difficult questions over a sprinkler system that wasn’t operational and the presence of flammable art installations amid the wood-panelled beauty of the building. Such questions were never properly answered.This time a palpable sense of anger is beginning to form as Glasgow braces itself for the news that its most cherished building is now beyond repair. How could this happen again and why was it engulfed so rapidly?The alarm was raised by a passing policeman at 11.15 on Friday night. Why then was there no security? What was the status of the fire-proofing on a building still recovering from widespread third-degree burns?From the vantage point of a rooftop car park a few blocks away, the charred roof timbers were still giving off steam in a curtain of Clydeside rain. They told their own story and hinted at mortal damage. In the streets below little groups of people, still unable to comprehend what they were seeing, formed behind the police tapes. Among them were the art students who had studied there these last few years.A few hours before the students had been celebrating after their graduation ceremony. Among them was Beth Cowey. “We were in the city centre not far away from the art school and when the first news of the fire began to circulate I simply refused to believe them,” she said. “It’s difficult to comprehend and to convey how much this place means to those of us who were lucky enough to have been there and to have seen it in its original glory before the first fire.”Four years ago the painter Alison Watt, one of Glasgow School of Art’s most renowned alumni, wrote about her love for this place in the Observer. “It was a building in which we were encouraged to think about the world and our place in it. We graffitied its walls, dressed up its plaster casts, hung from its balconies and clambered on to its roof but, most importantly, we worked there,” she wrote. “And long before it was seen as a museum or a place of reverence, the brilliance of Mackintosh’s design encouraged us to work hard. His idea of the Glasgow School of Art, and ours, lives on.”On Friday night she could scarcely believe that her beloved building had been grievously damaged once more. “This building lived and breathed its purpose,” she said. “Now, like many others, I want to know how this could happen again.”This time too Glasgow wants some answers to questions never adequately addressed after the last fire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ce392c0247b3b4d821ea2886374f17b27fab2f/0_208_4898_2939/master/4898.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c646b2816a7c3f9ac008129c907330d","title":"koala faecal transplant could save species","story":"Team of researchers changes microbes in koalas’ guts in order to improve type of food they consumeScientists believe they have found a new weapon in the battle to save endangered species: faecal transplants. They say that by transferring faeces from the gut of one animal to another they could boost the health and viability of endangered creatures. In particular, they believe the prospects of saving the koala could be boosted this way.The idea of using faecal transplants as conservation weapons was highlighted this month at the American Society for Microbiology meeting in Atlanta, where scientists outlined experiments in which they used the technique to change microbes in the guts of koalas.Microbes play a key role in digesting fibres in the animal’s diet of eucalyptus leaves – which come in two main varieties: manna gum and messmate.“Messmate is clearly inferior to manna gum: it has less protein and more tannins,” said the project leader, Ben Moore of Western Sydney University.However, some koalas eat only messmate and others only manna gum. Few eat both – and that is because manna-gum-eating koalas have different bacteria in their guts from those that ate\u0026nbspmessmate.This raised the crucial question: could scientists change the microbes in a koala’s gut so that they could change the type of eucalyptus that the animal could consume? The answer was to carry out transplants of bacteria from the faeces of one set of koalas into the group that had different eucalyptus diets.“We succeeded,” Moore told the Observer. The team found it was able to alter the koala’s gut bacteria from one type to the\u0026nbspother.The development is crucial because it should help the preservation not just of koalas – by aiding their ability to digest different types of eucalyptus – but should also help other endangered creatures. As the journal Nature reported, other researchers at the conference outlined work – again involving making changes in gut microbes – that could boost the fertility of southern white rhinoceros which do not reproduce well in captivity, a problem that is linked to their diets, it was found."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5030e58ccf7ab4a6538615110f3b29e043245338/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=259d70442e5d2841fdbca2b566675c8b 700w","title":"daddy cool fathers day fashion","story":"Four new dads speak out about the joys of parenthood – and celebrate Father’s Day in styleHow do you start the day with Imaya?

I’ve only worn a suit in parliament under duress, when I was on the front bench. I’ve dressed like this for a while, but only recently realised that it’s pretty much the same way my dad, Tony, dressed when I was growing up. In the early 80s, he went from being a factory worker to a trade union official, going overnight from being a shop steward to driving a car, having a briefcase and travelling around the country as a district officer, and he would wear tweedy type jackets, a shirt, a tie, trousers and comfortable shoes. Me dressing like him is nothing new, though – I was nicking my dad’s shoes and trousers as a teenager. I used to wear his Farah trousers to school, and I remember kids going: “Bloody hell, Lewis, where did you get Farahs from?’When I was growing up, my dad wore a lot of browns and greens – darker colours, autumnal colours. When I was on the BBC news trainee scheme, around the turn of the millennium, we had someone come in and talk to us about what you wear on television, and I was told that khakis, greens and browns went very well with my skin tone. It was something I liked, so I’ve often worn those colours, but maybe I was influenced by my dad as well.In his 40s, my dad refound his youth a bit, and started going to the West Indian club in Northampton, where I’m from, where the West Indian diaspora would go to socialise on a Friday night, and have a drink and a dance to soca and the like. Would I have said there was a West Indian flavour to what he wore, though? Not really. I’ve got uncles who wore garish stuff, you know, electric blue polyester suits, and they carried it off. But my dad never went down that path, he has never been into loud stuff. His style was fashionable, but never sharp. Having said that, when he was growing up in Grenada a bus driver did nickname him “iron shirt” because his clothes were so starched. I’ve seen pictures of him at Sunday school, too, with his siblings and cousins, with their knee socks, shiny shoes and crisp white shirts, partings in their hair. But his style was never overly preened or perfect. Even so, to this day, he still takes care of his appearance. He wears a lot of comfortwear now, but he likes good stuff, quality brands.I remember the first time I appeared on the BBC, on the regional news, I phoned him up and said: ‘What do you think?’ The first thing he said was: ‘Why didn’t you do your tie up properly?’ I just sat there going: ‘What the hell?’ My dad was more interested in how I looked he thought that was really important. And I was like, what about what I said? It was a very “West Indian parent” reaction. He has taught me about certain faux pas, too. I remember I was wearing jogging bottoms with what I thought were trainers, but my dad thought looked like shoes, and he laughed and said you can’t wear shoes with jogging bottoms. His rule was trainers with shorts and jogging bottoms, never shoes. Shoes only went with trousers and jeans. It might seem a bit obvious, but it does look really weird if you don’t follow it.With him being a single dad, we were very close. Our relationship was established at a critical age when I was a teenager, and there was a level of respect that was garnered over those years that at the time I probably didn’t appreciate. He had my best interests at heart – and taught me how to look good, too. As I approach my first Father’s Day with a child of my own, I can fully appreciate it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be7172debc614a736d753f9e64b3e5b1572680bd/0_97_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ee216551609091aa360843b28584736","title":"argentina iceland world cup match report","story":"With 64 minutes gone Argentina seemed to have found the decisive break on a tight, bruising afternoon that saw their revered attack struggle to find its gears against an excellent Iceland team.The score was 1-1, as it would finish. Iceland were holding steady. With a long pass from the left Sergio Agüero was suddenly in space in the area, sent tumbling by a collision with Hördur Björgvin Magnússon. The penalty was given. Half of the stadium leapt up, phones raised as Lionel Messi stepped up to take it, breath drawn to yowl and cheer as the ball hit the net.Or perhaps not. Messi’s kick was terrible, too close to Hannes Thór Halldórsson, who guessed the right way and palmed the ball far enough from goal.In the stands heads were cradled, jaws dropped. But what an astonishingly brilliant moment for Halldórsson, who six years ago directed Iceland’s entry to the Eurovision song contest, but who has now saved a penalty from Messi in front of a few hundred million people, not to mention his future grandkids, great-grandkids and anyone else who meets him for the next 60 years with an active YouTube feed.Argentina were denied again with 13 minutes to go, as Cristian Pavón was tripped in the area by Birkir Már Sævarsson. He might easily have had another penalty. Confusingly no VAR review was called for. By the time Iceland had taken their goal-kick the moment had passed.Fifa really has opened the box on this one, with the debate on exactly how these complex attempts to find certainty in a game of endless subjective opinion should be applied. Strap in. The VAR blah starts here.So Iceland held on in this Group D opener to take a deserved point from their first World Cup game. This is a rise that has been pegged out in moments. Here was another one, a new plateau for the smallest nation ever to get to the World Cup – albeit against an Argentina team that pressed hard, had most of the possession and might easily have won the game but also presented their own weaknesses to the world.This was goalkeeper Willy Caballero’s first competitive international. It might be his last if Franco Armani has been looking smart in training. There was a fumble for Iceland’s goal, one horrible attempt at jazzed-up possession play from the back and also a first-half shot that was palmed away with all the agility of a dead tree falling over in a high wind.Throughout all this there was a lovely spectacle at a packed-out stadium. Before kick-off on a dazzlingly bright Moscow day the Spartak Arena was gripped with a wonderful rolling surge of noise. The sight of Messi’s impassive ginger-bearded face on the big screen as the teams walked out drew the first ear-splitting whistle from the main Albiceleste end.The Iceland coach, Heimir Hallgrímsson, had been phlegmatic as ever on facing Argentina’s universe-boss-level playmaker. “I don’t have a magic formula,” Hallgrímsson said with a shrug on the eve of this game.In the event Iceland packed the midfield, with Gylfi Sigurdsson, just returned from injury, as a No 10 in possession, a No 8 without the ball. And throughout they played Messi supremely well, with Aron Einar Gunnarsson always quick to intrude on his personal space.A huge punted long pass from back to front put Alfred Finnbogason in for a shot over the bar. And from the ensuing sweep-keeper horror show of a goal-kick Birkir Bjarnason scuffed past the post on the run when he looked certain to score.There was a reminder after 20 minutes had gone that Messi is not the only world-class footballer in Argentina’s team. Nobody works a pocket of space quite like Agüero, a player with legs so rubbery he can spring through a 180-degree circle in the time it takes others to think about raising their left foot.Here Agüero took the ball in the area and pirouetted away from Ragnar Sigurdsson. No back-lift was required. With a swish of air the ball was in the top corner.Finnbogason’s equaliser a few minutes later was the product of excellent Icelandic pressing, drawing slackness down the right and that fumble from Caballero as the cross from Gylfi Sigurdsson came in. Iceland’s centre-forward moved more quickly than the swamp-bound defenders around him to poke the ball home.Iceland sat back. Argentina pressed without any real sense of edge. There was a shout for a penalty as the ball bounced up from close range and hit the hand of the sliding Ragnar Sigurdsson. Jorge Sampaoli, the Argentina coach, capered and fumed on the touchline. But Sigurdsson was guilty of little more than possessing arms in the usual place arms tend to be.For long periods after the break Argentina were ponderous in central midfield against opponents who dropped deep. Ángel Di María provided little effective width. On the right Eduardo Salvio made good ground at times. There were chances, shots that whistled just wide, and that missed Messi penalty. But Iceland were cool throughout, their point welcomed with a huge Nordic cheer.No doubt some will draw a parallel with Cristiano Ronaldo’s wonderful hat-trick on Friday evening – an extreme contrast with Messi’s impotence here. But this was an occasion that belonged above all to the men from the volcanic rock in the middle of the Atlantic, whose extraordinary world tour is not showing any sign of losing its momentum yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cfa61e3d681a5821110b0d91c0ed4540d055c89/9_103_1877_1126/master/1877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=797e104889e67fbe6051a07c0c3ec9b3","title":"croatia nigeria world cup match report","story":"Croatia, considered tournament dark horses by many, cruised through their opening encounter with Nigeria thanks to an own goal from Oghenekaro Etebo and a penalty from Luka Modric.The victory leaves Croatia top of Group D but after a largely forgettable game in which they did not manage a shot on target from open play until the 92nd minute Zlatko Dalic’s men will know they must improve if they are to make the kind of impression on the World Cup that their roster of talent suggests they are capable of.“A win is a win,” Dalic said, brushing off complaints about the lack of clear chances for his side. “Corners and penalties are part of football. It doesn’t matter how you score – it matters that you score.”Modric, however, seemed to acknowledge that the might of Argentina and the sheer willpower of Iceland are likely to provide sterner tests than Nigeria. “I believe that on the wings of this win we will up our game and continue our journey in the way that we planned before coming here,” he said.Croatia have failed to get past the group stage since the stunning third-place finish in 1998 inspired by Davor Suker’s goals, and have been drawn in perhaps the closest approximation to a Group of Death that this tournament has.They were the firm favourites for this game, with one of the most impressive midfields in the tournament on paper, and many in the so-called “golden generation” likely to be playing at their last World Cup. Nigeria, by contrast, have the youngest squad at the World Cup, with the veteran midfielder Mikel John Obi guiding a youthful team epitomised by the goalkeeper, 19-year-old Francis Uzoho.The first half an hour was rather insipid, with both sides comfortable on the ball but unable to find a way through a tough midfield, and repeated stoppages for petty fouls. Croatia looked more lame horse than dark horse at times but showed flashes of danger, with Ivan Perisic firing just over the bar and Mario Mandzukic just past the post from distance. Nigeria also looked dangerous going forward, surging towards the penalty area on a number of occasions without being able to find the final product.Just after the half-hour mark, Modric, who had previously put in two poor corners from the left, hit a delightful ball in from his third attempt, this time from the right. The outswinging ball was flicked on from the edge of the six-yard box by Ante Rebic towards Mandzukic, whose ing header was going wide but was helped into the net with a hefty deflection off the back of Etebo’s leg.The fortunate goal seemed to breathe some life into Croatia, and a few minutes later Andrej Kramaric headed just over from Rakitic’s cross. Nigeria spent first-half injury time going forward but a speculative shot from Victor Moses that sailed over the bar after a spell of pressure summed up their half.The game meandered on after the interval, both sides looking reasonably competent but largely uninspiring, and Croatia always the more likely to produce a flash of skill or a dangerous attack. Rebic fired over from a brilliantly whipped-in cross by Perisic, though the linesman had his flag up – wrongly, it seemed – for offside against Perisic.With 20 minutes remaining Croatia won a penalty as Mandzukic was needlessly fouled by William Troost-Ekong, who was climbing all over him at a corner. It was the kind of penalty that is often not given but Nigeria could have few complaints that it had been. Modric dispatched the penalty coolly to make it 2-0, in what was Croatia’s first shot on target.In the end, it was a comfortable victory, with encouraging performances from Rebic and Kramaric in midfield and Modric providing the occasional searching ball. Croatia now control the group but the real test of their World Cup ambitions will come in Nizhny Novgorod on Thursday, when they meet Argentina, who drew 1-1 with Iceland on Saturday.“It’s going to be tough, they will have to play for a win because of the scoreline of today’s game that they never expected, but this is an important game for us as well,” said Modric."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3b7cb5ea35a2e234605964198afe0ba13112f74/0_98_4782_2870/master/4782.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abe565aac3b4b77dd37f223bd8cb7bf5","title":"gareth southgate england team selection tunisia world cup","story":"Gareth Southgate has moved to ease any anxiety within his England squad by making the unusual decision to reveal his selection to the players well in advance of Monday’s opening group game against Tunisia.England travel to Volgograd with a fully fit squad available to the manager, with Marcus Rashford having been integrated back into training in Repino, and with their lineup for the Group G opener decided. That is understood to mean World Cup debuts for nine players with starts for Ashley Young at left wing-back and Harry Maguire in central defence, while Jordan Henderson will be the side’s midfield anchor instead of Eric Dier.The choice to disclose the selection to his players is surprising for Southgate, who has tended to name his side on the day of the game, but is designed to allow those involved to focus fully on their task at the Volgograd Arena. Rob Green revealed last week that he had been given only two hours’ notice he was to play in England’s opening game at the 2010 World Cup and duly made a bad mistake in the 1-1 draw with the United States. It would be almost two years before the goalkeeper played for England again.“The players know the team for the first game already,” said Southgate. “We have been working on a system of play we think suits the players we have available and the style of play we want to implement as well.“From our fans’ point of view, they’re enjoying seeing young players come into the squad. Everyone at home wants England to win but they want to see them play well and enjoy their football and that’s what I want as a coach. So if we can marry those things and the environment is right, then we think results become part of that process.“Whenever you represent England, or any other country, there’s expectation, there’s hope, you carry the dreams of a nation, and it’s impossible to say to any player you can go out and play without any feeling of pressure or any feeling or fear.“But what you have to do is make sure that doesn’t control you and that you go for it in your performances. You don’t feel: ‘Oh, I was inhibited in the way I played’ or worry about making mistakes because mistakes will happen for certain. So no, I think pressure is what you perceive and very often that comes from listening to too much external noise. Actually we have to focus on the things we can control and they’re things within our camp and within our team.”Southgate heaped praise on Harry Kane but has urged the Tottenham striker’s creative teammates to ease the goalscoring burden on his captain.“He’s only played something like seven games in our 18 matches and he’s scored eight goals, so he’s pretty important,” added Southgate.While Southgate was talking, Danny Rose explained why the squad is not about to question the manager. The left-back believes the moment he dropped Wayne Rooney for a World Cup qualifier in Slovenia in 2016, he put down an important marker.“I definitely didn’t expect the manager to drop him against Slovenia and as soon as we all saw that we knew the gaffer was not somebody to be messed around with,” said Rose.Monday’s Group G fixture will be officiated by the experienced Colombian referee, Wilmar Roldán, who has been on the Fifa list for a decade and is at his second World Cup finals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/551a4ba8c0ab71555175d34edfde42d2dd9863ed/0_182_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddd5ed53587f1d4389045258fab92c1f","title":"pubs struggling attract customers viewing world cup football","story":"Embattled pubs across the country hope to lure in England fans to revive their fortunesA miniature grandstand isn’t the first thing you’d expect to find in the car park of a modest Norfolk pub. But at the Railway Tavern in Dereham, landlord Paul Sandford points out that it’s not every day he has such an opportunity to drum up extra business. From their seats fans will be able to follow the England team’s efforts on 16 giant TV screens – including one in the toilet.“We expect the first England game on Monday to be heaving. But pubs generally are struggling and we are now threatened by people watching at home and, increasingly, on their phones and other devices. It’s up to us to provide a fantastic pub atmosphere and a unique viewing experience.”As World Cup fever grips the UK, pubs up and down the country are pulling out the stops to lure fans in to cheer on Gareth Southgate’s squad.The embattled pub sector has already been hit hard by a combination of factors – the soaring price of a pint, the smoking ban, the 2008 financial crisis and, most recently, spiralling business rates. The number of pubs is dwindling, according to the 2018 edition of the Campaign for Real Ale’s Good Beer Guide, the total is now down to fewer than 47,000, with about 21 closing every week.But their latest challenge is the increase in people watching this year’s World Cup from home, on catch-up or on their mobile phones, with millennials’ viewing and live-streaming habits in particular driving an unprecedented shake-up in this market.All 64 World Cup matches are being shown live on TV, with ITV and BBC splitting the rights to show the matches on both their traditional channels and respective online services. Unfortunately, a glitch at the opening meant some people streaming the match on ITV’s website missed the start of the tournament.The larger chains are tempting fans not only with wall-to-wall TV screens but also special offers on food and drink. Fullers’ “The Beautiful Game” offer has “dips and chips” and “World Cup burgers” based on sauce flavours representing participating countries.Wetherspoons – which serves an estimated 2 million customers every week in its 880 pubs – is offering a wide range of beers, including European brews that tie in with countries competing, and encouraging customers to pair their chosen drinks accordingly. Mitchells \u0026amp Butlers’ O’Neill’s “live sport” bars are inviting fans to book online in order to “grab great deals on buckets of beers, crafts and ciders as well as bottles of spirits and mixers”.On a smaller scale, in Hackney, east London, renowned gastropub The Marksman – Michelin’s pub of the year in 2017 – will be screening the England games to accompany its £30 tasting menu.But in city centres traditional pubs also face stiff competition from themed, air-conditioned sports bars, pop-ups and free, giant open-air screens in public areas. Flat Iron Square in London Bridge, for example, will boast two giant screens – one indoor and one outdoor. And Manchester235’s brand new Carlsberg Sports Bar bills itself as a “dedicated sports hub”, boasting a 70sq ft screen, with several more spread around the bar.Those extra drinks during the group stages could provide a boost of £42m to the economy, it says. With the friendly timings of England’s group stage fixtures meaning that the Three Lions will play Tunisia and Belgium in the evenings and Panama at the weekend, the BBPA is hopeful that the British pub will appeal.“While video on demand is available on a range of devices there’s still no better place to enjoy live sport on the TV than at the great British pub,” said Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the BBPA.“Only being at the game itself can compare with being in the pub, which is why we expect millions of fans to go to their local to watch the football … we predict sales of 14 million extra pints from England’s group stage games alone.”As those fans not tempted by the pub prepare to hunker down at home for their football viewing, Tesco predicts it will sell nearly 140 million bottles and cans of beer and more than 2 million pizzas during the tournament.But as an antidote to World Cup fever, some pubs hope to capitalise on their status as “football-free” zones offering an oasis of peace and tranquillity. Among them is the Jerusalem Tavern in Clerkenwell, London, regularly listed among the capital’s finest pubs and the city’s only outlet for the Suffolk-based St Peter’s Brewery.“Not every pub is football crazy and we want to offer our customers the chance to escape from it and still have a nice quiet pint,” said general manager Dan Lucas. “I’ve worked for pub companies which invested thousands in new TVs in previous years, only for everyone to lose interest as soon as England were eliminated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9cafa096c06c61c5a19799a8f1ad1e474915c75/0_13_3124_1874/master/3124.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb1f56a01be56e4c6787834aa8fee876","title":"tite brazil switzerland world cup","story":"For a section of the Brazilian media here Tite’s novel policy of rotating the Seleção captaincy from game to game, in an effort to promote collective leadership, raises the obvious question: who gets the gig in the final and lifts the World Cup trophy?At the last tournament in Brazil the then manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari, had talked about “seven steps to heaven”. His team, notoriously, would descend into hell after step six – the 7-1 humbling against Germany, which has hung over them ever since.The exorcism will be possible only if Brazil can go all the way in Russia and there is no doubt that failure is not exactly on the press agenda at present. A nation does not expect, it assumes and, given the way Tite has re-energised the set-up, who can blame them?The pressure is excruciating and, when Tite faced the media on the eve of Sunday’s Group E opener against Switzerland, it seemed revealing that he was asked whether he was on any medication to help him sleep. His response – part humour, part conviction – reflected his comfort and it extends to the trappings of Brazil’s tag of favourites. They are here to win it and Tite is not afraid to say so.“As somebody who has been through eight or nine surgeries, I take no drugs,” he said. “I try to manage my ghosts, my angst, my human side. Yes, there is this expectation. I just try to focus on what matters.“The work we have done gives us the expectation but also a lot of inner peace. We have been building up to this for some time. Winning is a dream and my focus is totally geared to that. It feels like the world is looking at us but we want to be natural on the pitch, like we have been in all the games.”Tite has given the captaincy to Marcelo for the Switzerland tie and, with Dani Alves out injured, it appears that he will continue to pass the armband around. He had previously indicated that Alves, who has captained the team the most during his tenure, would assume the responsibility in Russia. Each member of Tite’s likely XI against Switzerland has captained the team, even the 21-year-old striker Gabriel Jesus.Marcelo, one of only six survivors from the last World Cup, radiated confidence, particularly when asked about the 7-1. “There is no longer any trauma,” Marcelo said. “If there was, I wouldn’t be playing any more. I would have retired. Of course, I wish it were different but there is no trauma. I always look for new goals and this World Cup is another challenge.“The captaincy is something that I like. When you are a kid playing on the beach, you dream of representing the national team and now I have the opportunity to be captain at a World Cup. Money cannot buy this feeling. In the group everybody contributes but I am 30 and, of course, you gain experience.”In the numbers game that can colour match previews Tite can point to having suffered defeat only once in his 21 matches in charge – against Argentina in a friendly. There have been 17 wins. But there is another detail that seems to have slipped under the radar.It comes from the Switzerland side and it is the one that shows them in sixth position in the Fifa world rankings, looking down on France and Spain, among others. How the world governing body gets to its master-list is often questioned and mocked but do not tell the Swiss they do not deserve their status. “We have worked hard to have this ranking,” Stephan Lichtsteiner, the captain, said. Before the Brazil game it underpins the quiet confidence that has built around their camp.Vladimir Petkovic’s team are set up to pass and pass – everything goes through the midfield fulcrum Granit Xhaka – and there was the statistic from Euro 2016, when Switzerland reached the last 16, that showed they had enjoyed more possession than their opponents in every game, even against France in the final group tie, which finished 0-0.The right-back is set for a direct confrontation with Brazil’s brightest star. “He is probably the best and most complete player in that position in the world,” Lichtsteiner added. But he returned with a measure of swiftness to Switzerland’s pre-match message – they are hellbent on showcasing their own game.“It’s about us imposing ourselves and using our full-backs to get forward,” Lichtsteiner said. “We have to be cohesive as a team and close the gaps when we confront players like Neymar.”Petkovic mentioned how his team’s mentality had grown during his four years in charge. They have lost only once in their previous 22 matches, winning 16 of them. “I always focus on our way of playing,” he said. “We will try to dominate and win. We are not here to make a lovely match against Brazil but to win it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c7be63e324b5f508ad66791e3db83814d4a0a03/0_181_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95bc6735b2a53e5092388f0c2d026767","title":"tunisia england world cup arab spring","story":"National side to play in the World Cup for first time since jasmine revolutionTaher Lwati sat outside a toyshop on one of the quiet avenues that crisscross central Tunis, soaking up the warm evening air and ruminating on the chances of an unlikely footballing victory.“The national team comes above all else. I’ve been following the sport for years and, really, I just want to see Tunisia get through to the next round before I die,” said Lwati, 63. To do that, the side will have to prove their mettle on Monday against their first World Cup opponents: England.“The English team is way out of our league, but football is full of surprises, even the England coach says so. But, you know,” he said, “if God wills it, we might do it.”For many in Tunisia, celebrated abroad as the sole success of the Arab spring, the fruits of 2011 have provided slim pickings. Mired in debt, struggling against unemployment and enmeshed in the throes of a political and economic crisis, ordinary Tunisians’ nerves are frayed and the World Cup promises sorely needed relief. As violence continues to dominate the domestic league, the national team provides a single point of focus that, for a few weeks, the entire country can look to in hope.Tunisia first qualified for the World Cup 40 years ago, and then took part in three tournaments from 1998 to 2006. This, however, will be the first time they have played in the tournament since the jasmine revolution that toppled the dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. “This team is different,” said Khmira. “We’ve got some strong tactical players who can create opportunities to score. Look out for Naim Sliti, Anice Badri and Wahbi Khazri. They could do it. I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, we’ve got to be realistic, but yes, draws against England and Belgium and a win against Panama could put us through. It could happen.”Across Tunisia the national game has retained a sense of purity, untainted by either political self-interest or marred by the increasingly violent clashes between fans and police that have come to define the country’s domestic league.Nevertheless many of Tunisia’s contemporary political figures are looking to associate themselves with the sport and its power to galvanise a public increasingly disillusioned with Tunis’s political infighting. “Many examples show the growing importance of football in political careers after 2011,” Meddeb said, pointing to the party of President Beji Caid Essebsi, Nidaa Tounes, whose lead candidates for recent municipal elections in Tunis, Sousse and Sfax were current or former presidents of the cities’ football clubs.However, the sense of national unity is far removed from the violence that has dogged its domestic game as, in the face of entrenched unemployment and widespread corruption, many of Tunisia’s young football fans are finding a sense of identity within their clubs and the clashes with the notoriously heavy-handed police. In April, that violence claimed the life of 19-year-old Omar Laabidi, after police were accused of chasing him into one of the canals near the national stadium.Football had “always been an arena for political contestation,” Meddeb said. “Young people express their grievances in football stadiums, organise themselves into ultras groups and defy the police forces. Increasingly violence becomes a serious feature of the stadiums.”Moreover, as violence fuels still further violence, the situation deteriorates. “Some groups are getting fascinated by violence and many ultras members became jihadists. The economic and social crisis is fuelling youth anger that finds in football a mean to express this disenchantment.”Nabil Ben Khayatia, a kitchen worker from Tunis, said the national game was different. “There’s no violence,” he said. “People come together. I’ll be watching it with all my family. We’ll go out to a cafe and cheer on the national team. There’ll be young people, old people, everyone’s going to be there.”Taher agreed. “Women, old men, children: everyone’s really excited for the World Cup,” he said. “It’s going to bring us together. For me, I’m counting down the minutes to the next game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6213d50fbd6aafbe3051487a65c1887c1034acb/3_123_2267_1360/master/2267.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d41b1741ecd431d83b4df256f192451e","title":"welcome var brave new world with echoes of footballs past","story":"Welcome, VAR, to the World Cup. Take a seat. We’ve been expecting you. On matchday three of Russia 2018, Fifa’s early-stage experiment with video technology stood briefly centre stage. This, finally, was the new world.Although, in the event, the debate around two marginal penalty decisions for France and Argentina will be jarringly familiar to anyone with any experience of the previous 140 years or so of football refereeing. Plus ça change, plus c’est the same old story all over again: with the same argument, the same subjective calls, the same claims of injustice.Saturday afternoon brought two games 650 miles apart. Both had similar incidents involving a trip in the area. Both saw two different applications of the process to two very similar scenarios.In the early kick-off in Kazan, France were awarded a penalty shortly before the hour for a trip on Antoine Griezmann by the trailing leg of Josh Risdon. Initially no penalty was given by the on-field referee. Instantly the video assistant ref informed his colleague that the incident should be reviewed. A penalty was then awarded.Three hours later in Moscow, Cristian Pavón went down in the Iceland penalty area after a challenge from Birkir Már Sævarsson. Once again play was waved on. This time there was no VAR interjection. Iceland took a goalkick and the game continued.At which point enter, if not quite controversy, then evidence that a system designed to still the tedium of endless debate has its own potential for irresolvable differences of opinion.What can VAR be used for? A clear and obvious error relating to a goal, penalty decision, red card or mistaken identity.Was the Antoine Griezmann penalty decision correctly altered? Those familiar with VAR say it was. The Australia defender Josh Ridson lifted his leg and tripped the France forward. Whether he intended to do so is irrelevant.Did the VAR decide it was not worth looking at the incident when Iceland\u0027s Birkir Már Sævarsson brought down Argentina\u0027s Cristian Pavón?\u0026nbspYes. It is understood the VAR said in the referee\u0027s earpiece “play on, play on”, signifying there was no need for a second look.\u0026nbspWhen can the VAR intervene?\u0026nbspOther than with violent conduct, only before the next restart of play. If the ball does not go out after a penalty decision – as with France’s spot-kick – they get to use that extra time.Is Fifa happy with the way it is working?\u0026nbspYes, Fifa is understood to be happy on the basis of the first three days\u0027 play, despite the controversy. It thinks the right decisions have been taken. So VAR, so good is the feeling. Martha KelnerThe first point is that ultimately both refereeing decisions were correct, if only because neither was obviously wrong. Whatever one person with the right authority decides: that is correct. So far, so much the same.The element of controversy comes because both incidents would seem to have the same level of claim on a video review, the second non-reviewed one arguably more so. Argentina’s fans will see a trip on Pavón. It is a matter of opinion, as ever. But replays suggest there was at least as much contact andor reviewable grey area as in the Griezmann incident.At the end of which VAR has offered us uncertainty and 50-50 judgment at one remove. We have simply kicked this endlessly tedious debate into some longer grass a little further off. The parameters have been narrowed. Obvious mistakes can be weeded out. But where once the subjectivity came on-field, now it comes in the VAR’s office.Opponents of VAR will question whether it really is worth interrupting the game for this. Is it worth obsessing over the thoughts of the referees, incurring all the expense (financial and otherwise) of officials and screens, simply to introduce an incremental degree of semi-accuracy to an essentially random series of on-field collisions?What we have learned from the first real VAR moment at this World Cup is that no two VARs are the same, that there will not be a uniform review standard. On top of this, as we always knew in a chaotic, always marginal game, that there is no objective truth to be rooted out. Papering as thickly as possible over the cracks is all that can be hoped for here.At the end of which the VAR-flavoured universe looks not dissimilar to the previous one. Fans of both Australia and Argentina can leave their World Cup matches aggrieved over decisions made. The referees can claim to have made the correct decision simply by making one where one was required. The closest to a clear error is the decision by the VAR in Moscow not to seek a review of the Pavón trip. But even then his judgment call is simply that.Debate. Matters of opinion. Hard luck stories. Football can’t help but provide this. No matter how finely we split the atom, its core will remain fluid and unstable. For now, with another VAR penalty awarded later in the day for Peru – correctly this time – it is simply time to buckle up and enjoy the ride with a technology that will always carry its own margins of uncertainty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6df12718bca8b98cbea06ddf7a12de9c3c295e3/0_104_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9a11c672e785827bc3cf0411c5061a8","title":"world cup 2018 day four updates as germany and brazil kick off live","story":"Did you know, Iceland’s population is less than 350,000 and they’re the smallest nation to qualify for the World Cup?

More on which to come.In the spirit of John Robins and Elis James I think we should tick off a few tastes before really digging into something hearty. I mean, does anybody really want to fill up on Croatia vs. Nigeria?Sure, it’s an excellent three points for Luka Modric and co. but when the main story of a match is how abject the defeated side proved to be (see Exhibit A: Russia 5-0 Saudi Arabia) it might be best to park a fulsome discussion of both countries until later in the tournament. Where shall we begin? How about by looking back on yesterday’s action: four games, eight goals and endless controversy. The Football Weekly massive have bravely digested that feast of football and battled through the inevitable postprandial haze to communicate everything you need to know, in podcast form. The 40-minute show is ideal in duration to take an adult labrador for a stroll through a suburban park. I know, because that’s what I did shortly before signing on here. Hello everybody and welcome to the start of day four of Russia 2018. It’s a day that promises plenty with the first sightings of heavyweights Germany and Brazil. None of the other strongly fancied teams have stamped their authority on this World Cup yet so a statement performance from either perennial contender could lay down a marker to the rest of the competition.Brazil feature against Switzerland in the last of three matches. Before that we’ve got Germany taking on Mexico. And before that Costa Rica and Serbia meet in what’s sure to be a barnburner as a consequence of so many fans sacrificing it in favour of completing basic life admin tasks that have been put on hold during this weekend orgy of football.There’s no shortage of talking points from day three to churn through as well, not least the debut of Video Assistant Referees at a World Cup. I’m sure there’ll be plenty of correspondence to get through on that subject, so feel free to email or tweet me about VAR or anything else Mundial related you want to discuss.

Live Alone and Like It: The Art of Solitary Refinement is a cheery little volume that was first published in 1936, and remains in print today. Written by Marjorie Hillis, an editor at American Vogue, and a bestseller in its time, it was aimed at a new generation of women who, whether by design or default, suddenly found themselves living the single life in tiny flats and rooms in cities in both the US and Britain. I don’t live alone, but I look at it quite often. It’s one of those books that, in certain moods, works on you like a really good cocktail or a blast of exactly the right music: an antidote, if not to despair, then to the existential angst that dogs us all every now and again.Hillis covers everything: soft furnishings, what to keep on your drinks trolley, the matter of boyfriends and whether they should stay or go. But it’s the chapter about eating alone I like best. Among its pages, you won’t find any dreary recipes for one though she rightly regards corned beef hash as a very fine thing indeed, she would rather leave that sort of stuff to stodgier, less inspiriting writers than herself.You will, however, find plenty of other advice. Dress up for dinner, she says – or don’t, if you want to wear your pyjamas. Be sure there’s something in the fridge besides three-day-old leftovers (one-day-old leftovers, on the other hand, are supremely delicious).Make full use of, and don’t ever despise, cans (tinned crab is good, gussied up, and so are tinned peaches, especially with raspberry sauce). Above all, remember that proper nourishment equals strength, mental and physical. Feeding yourself is more important even than taking off your makeup.Back in the 21st century, the evidence mounts that eating alone is a bad thing. A survey published last month based on research carried out among 8,000 British adults found that doing so is more strongly associated with unhappiness than any factor other than mental illness other studies have suggested that solitary dining is both a risk factor for depression, and that those who do it often are at increased risk of heart disease and diabetes.Such stories tend to get widely reported, and no wonder: a lot more of us eat alone now than in Marjorie Hillis’s day, just as a lot more of us do everything else alone (television, sex, you name it). In 2018, even those who live with other people can be isolated, running on their own timetables, shutting the rest of the world out.None of these findings seem particularly surprising to me, and not only because it’s pretty obvious that cooking only for yourself can seem, at the end of a long day, like far too much effort (thus, we slump on our sofas and eat junk).Everyone knows that there aren’t many things lovelier or more affirming than eating supper with someone you love when my grandpa died, it was mealtimes that made my granny most miserable. But then again, I’ve never minded eating alone, at least at home (it’s a different story if you’re talking about restaurants, which aren’t always exactly a pleasure for the single woman).This is when I get to eat all the things that other people hate (chicken livers, mostly). This is when I’m allowed to read at the table. This is when I can take as little time, or as long, to scoff whatever happens to be on my plate.Admittedly, there’s now an element of luxury in this for me. Peace and quiet. No one else to please. The sense of a pause opening up. But even in the years – they were quite long – when I did live alone, doing so never seemed to be too bad, perhaps because, like Hillis, I’ve always been a great one for the rituals of dinner. Napkins, candles, all that. Small things, carefully deployed, can make the quotidian not only softly comforting, but quietly radiant, too: a favourite mug, a beloved knife, that slightly chipped dish you found in some market. Taking one of the few old bits of china I’ve inherited out of the cupboard somehow makes me feel connected, even when I’m entirely alone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4ec439f34e5d3a0b376b91eae1998630a389f05/0_525_4184_2511/master/4184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0cdc9298a9e065687cf3893beb22898","title":"meera sodha recipe wild rice chickpea aubergine salad tamarind dressing","story":"This muddle of rice and vegetables drizzled with spice is a great picnic comboMy family has been picnicking in England since 1972, when they arrived here after being expelled from Uganda by Idi Amin.

Drain the chickpeas, add to the rice, then cover with plenty of cold water and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and leave to simmer for 18 minutes, or until tender. Drain into a sieve, then cover with a clean tea towel and leave for 10 minutes.Now make the dressings. In a small bowl, mix the tamarind paste, date syrup and oil with a tablespoon of water. Add the chilli, cumin and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and mix again.Put the yoghurt in a second small bowl.

They made you muddy, but they also – in the hardcore 10km or 10-mile versions – gave you electric shocks. You did them with team-mates, and everyone helped each other, and it was very bonding. It is more within my capabilities, but more alien to my outlook than the triathlon or the marathon – a kind of Sports Relief or Red Nose Day for grownups excessive physical exertion combined with enforced camaraderie.I went to Bristol, partly for a change of scene, partly because it was a 5km and therefore, technically, a mini-Tough Mudder.

Its arrival was announced on stage at their On the Run II tour at the London Stadium in the UK on Saturday, where screens projected the message “album out now”.The appearance of the nine-track album confirms the rumours that the Carters were pursuing a joint project. In November 2017, Jay-Z told the New York Times that he and Beyoncé had started working on something as they produced their respective albums 4:44 and Lemonade. “We were using our art almost like a therapy session,” he said. “And we started making music together.”Jay-Z’s 4:44 was widely interpreted as his response to Lemonade, in which Beyoncé appeared to reference his marital infidelity. Everything is Love depicts the couple in a state of romantic happiness, but confirms that they almost split up. “We broke up and got back together,” Jay-Z raps on Lovehappy. “We came and we conquered Now we’re happy in love,” Beyoncé adds. The Carters also released a video for Apeshit, directed by Ricky Saiz and shot at the Louvre in Paris in May.Everything is Love is not streaming on Spotify or Apple Music. Spotify does not offer any of Jay-Z’s major albums, and offers Beyoncé’s catalogue up to and including Lemonade. Beyoncé makes reference to her relationship with streaming platforms on Nice from the new album: “My success can’t be quantified If I gave two fucks – two fucks about streaming numbers Would have put Lemonade up on Spotify.”The album was initially expected to arrive around Beyoncé’s headline performance at this year’s Coachella festival in April.On Friday night, the couple dedicated a rendition of Forever Young, the Alphaville song sampled on Jay-Z’s 2009 single Young Forever, to the friends and families of the victims of the Grenfell tower fire. Both Beyoncé and Jay-Z wore green heart pin badges in support of the Justice4Grenfell campaign.Beyoncé and Jay-Z married on 4 April 2008. The couple have three children: Blue Ivy, age six, and twins Sir and Rumi, one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c612f741c784ff17a4e363d50906f6ead4b69ec/0_213_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a266e720057bbf3691142227e3d1a4c7","title":"kamasi washington interview jazz is like a horse you can ride out on heaven and earth","story":"“Shall we eat or shall we play?” asks Kamasi Washington, clutching his carved wooden cane in one bejewelled hand, his brushed gold saxophone in the other. He and his band are sitting cramped around one of the tiny tables of Le Baiser Salé, a jazz club in Paris’s Marais district, where three grey-haired men in smart trousers are thrumming away on stage. It’s the early hours and Washington has come here after playing a full show at the 1,500-capacity Bataclan now he and his bandmates are facing a familiar conundrum: wind down or give in to the irresistible urge to get back on stage right here.Unsurprisingly, music wins. The club’s in-house band apprehensively welcome Washington, flanked by his drummer Tony Austin and keys player Brandon Coleman. Then a sort of friendly duel ensues. It’s intriguing to watch the old guard – talented but stiff Parisian trads – figure out how to interlock notes with the new wave, a crew of California cats dressed like they’ve stepped off a Funkadelic record cover, freewheeling through the standards, fizzing with a bold new language.The next day, Washington laughs when I suggest that most musicians would rather party or pass out than find somewhere else to play after a big gig. “It’s just fun,” says the 37-year-old in a laidback drawl, clinking the silver rings adorning his fingers. “It’s chill.” Two weeks ago, he performed with a 40-strong choir and orchestra at Coachella, one of America’s major music festivals. It makes no difference to him and his band – most of whom he’s known since childhood – whether their audience is 20 or 20,000. “If we were stuck on a desert island with no people or no money,” he says, “we would still play music the whole time.”For now, however, Washington is the man credited with leading a jazz revival in the past few years, usually in a dashiki tunic and an array of medallions. He was one of the leading instrumentalists who contributed to Kendrick Lamar’s landmark album To Pimp a Butterfly in 2015, which helped bring contemporary jazz to a new audience. Washington’s own debut, a triple-disc album fittingly called The Epic, swiftly followed, continuing Lamar’s themes of black American identity and leading one critic to write that Washington is “the jazz voice of Black Lives Matter”. He’s also been called a jazz celebrity, who has the star power to launch an EP with an installation at a venerable museum (last year’s Harmony of Difference, at the Whitney in New York).In person, Washington is warm, witty and as breezy as his approach to genre. His maximalist fusions pull liberally from hip-hop, Afrobeat, funk and electro-funk from the spiritual jazz skronking of elders such as John Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders, the cosmic ideas of collective improvisation laid down by Sun Ra, and the theatricality of 60s and 70s film soundtracks. As a result, he doesn’t much like the term “jazz” instead he says “the music is the music”. “It’s like if all of a sudden I gave a different name to your hair than I gave to you, it wouldn’t make your hair a separate thing,” he says. “If I call your hair ‘Dilly’” – he laughs again – “like, ‘Hey, Dilly!’, it’s still you. I look at all this music as part of my heritage. Jazz is a part of me.”Washington grew up in South Central Los Angeles, which after the 1992 riots became a shorthand for “ghetto”. His mother is a science teacher, his father a music teacher, and he started playing sax at 13 (his dad also plays flute in his son’s touring band). Washington and Ronald Bruner Jr – one of his two drummers and the brother of bassistsongwritervocalist Thundercat – would call each other on the phone to boast about how much they’d each practised that day. “There’s a sense of urgency that you get growing up where we grew up,” says Washington. “I hate to talk about it in that sense because it’s a really beautiful place but there’s pressure to become a gangster, or to be poor.”Music, he says, was “one of the paths to success that you feel you have access to in my neighbourhood. Because it doesn’t always feel like you have access to all of them. When you find something that you’re good at, you definitely have a motivation to become great at it, because that’s your way to overcome these stereotypes.” A tight sense of community and a vibrant local music scene was influential, too. At the same time as listening to west coast hip-hop, Washington was hanging out in Leimert Park, a largely African area of LA, which is home to the nonprofit performing arts club World Stage, where he first saw Sanders play.Washington continued to find deeper connections between hip-hop and jazz when, in 2009, he started working as a session musician for Snoop Dogg. At the same time, he began to forge a new fusion LA sound with the West Coast Get Down, the collective with whom he still plays. Dubbed “the Wu-Tang of jazz”, these musicians, including Coleman, Austin, Bruner Jr and double bassist Miles Mosley, pooled their money one December to buy 30 days of studio time and cut all their records (including The Epic) in one go. But it was the call to go into the studio with Kendrick Lamar that fast-tracked Washington into mainstream consciousness.“I went in and I didn’t really know what he wanted me to do,” he remembers of the Butterfly sessions. “It was pretty hush-hush. I felt like I was going to go meet Barack Obama or something.” Still, he knew instinctively that Lamar’s expansive meditation on black identity was going to make an impact. “There’s this notion that music has to be confined to some small, simple place to be popular, something I never believed,” he says. “And when I heard that record I was like, he’s about to dispel that myth, he’s trying to open people up.”We move on to discussing police brutality. “It’s not just the police,” he says. “It’s not just the fact that police officers are committing violent acts… on innocent black people, it’s that our society, these juries, these judges, these prosecuting attorneys, these people who are not part of the police department are deeming these acts to be lawful. If it’s lawful for you to take my life because of my skin colour, there’s something wrong.”“I know that this grander scheme of thinking, the idea that we make the earth what we want it to be, can seem a bit naive, but that song, to me, is about not waiting for someone to do things for us but to do them for ourselves. One of the biggest problems we have is letting other people think for you. I listen to everyone, but I only believe myself.”I wonder what Washington is thinking when he wields his instrument, eyes closed. How does he communicate musically with his band?“It’s like being at a party. You meet someone and you try to find common ground,” he says. “You fish around a little bit. ‘Do you like sports? OK, so what kind of sports are you into? You’re into basketball. Are you into politics? Are you reading any books or watching any shows?’ And then you start to get a gist of who the person you’re talking to is. You’re constantly figuring it out.”There’s no doubting the renewed interest in jazz, but does it have the kind of crossover appeal to reach pop audiences? “I think so,” says Washington. “I’ve always felt there’s a misconception of jazz, that it requires some type of superiority to be appreciated. The idea of a music that connects you to your inner self – that connection is something that most people would enjoy if they tried.”Heaven and Earth is out on Young Turks on Friday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d5a0778b58f9c922730ea5f257d84ff61312071/0_231_5079_3047/master/5079.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2dec0cfcd0af3d12f13734745e99a73","title":"labour live for the few not the many","story":"JezFest got off to a slow start but revolution was in the air – among Remainers challenging Corbyn’s Brexit stanceThere was a moment, an hour before Jeremy Corbyn took to the stage at the Labour Live festival, when he might have believed himself a rock star. The Labour leader, in his short sleeved linen shirt and his pale chinos, checking his pockets for his speech and his reading specs, was shuffled through the crowd by three burly security guards, barking into walkie talkies. The crowd duly parted, before chasing him en masse the few yards across White Hart Lane Park as he was bustled backstage. Three teenage girls started scrolling, screaming, to see if they had caught the great man doing his trademark pop-eyed grin on their selfies.This is presumably the kind of excitement that the Labour organisers had envisaged when they promoted #Jezfest as an alternative Glastonbury. You would think after the party’s history with such jamborees – that takes in Kinnock’s Sheffield Rally, and the Millennium Eve fiasco in the Dome – that they might have learned to keep well clear of any event involving wristbands. For much of the day yesterday, they might have been wishing they had.When the gates opened at noon there was no festival stampede toward the main stage mosh pit, rather a steady stroll, followed by a laying out of tartan picnic rugs and folding camping chairs. In this, it seemed that the event had something of the authentic character of its headline act, even if that actually made it more village fete than Sandinista rally. One of the obvious problems of performing under the slogan of “For the Many” is when only a few of them turn up.After a week in which Labour seems to have lost momentum in the polls – despite the tragic ineptitude of the government – and in which 90 of its MPs had defied the whip over Brexit, the leadership clearly wanted to avoid a damp squib of a summer festival at all costs. Labour Live was conceived as a vehicle to channel the great surge of youth support that Jeremy Corbyn in particular enjoyed around last year’s general election. The lack of enthusiasm that had very publicly dogged this event, ever since it was announced must have left organisers praying for rain, so at least they could blame the weather.As it was, the sun mostly shone on the three very large tents and the main stage and on the queue forming outside the Unite the Union ice cream van that was giving out free 99s and playing a hurdy-gurdy version of the Red Flag. There was no visible revolt over the fact that half the crowd had coughed up £35 for their entry and the other half had been bussed in for free after the Labour party started desperately giving out tickets to make up the numbers. The growing sense that the leadership should not be reliably left in charge of party organisation at a brewery was compounded by the fact that the Workers Beer Company refused to provide keg versions of its product, because they were “reserved for high-volume events”.Using the Sean Spicer method of calculation, by early afternoon the park was filled as far as the eye could see: there were probably 3,000 people enjoying the afternoon events that included a People’s Question Time with Len McCluskey (a prelude to his hosting of hip-hop karaoke at tea time). Tottenham’s local MP David Lammy did his best as a warm-up man for a muted crowd. Speaking to him afterwards he suggested that his experience of festivals was that it would only “really get going later”. “I didn’t have the best slot of the day,” he suggested, loyally, “that is for Jeremy and Clean Bandit”.In The World Transformed tent activists were reaching out to a reluctant few dozen people on benches by trying to involve them in a game of “socialist runaround”. First question: “Jeremy Hunt is rhyming slang, agree or disagree?” Second question: “Will Labour take us back to the 1970s?” (This one came with a supplementary – “and would that be a bad thing?”) Final question: “Should we allow shareholders to make a profit?” Runaround now!More of the crowd flocked to the literary tent where there was a grown-up discussion of whether Corbyn’s socialism was a viable vision, led by the ’s Gary Younge. For a festival that was promoting free debate, however, it was hard to avoid the sense that there were one or two clear limits.Outside I met a few young representatives of For our Future’s Sake who were planning a “friendly protest” against the party’s refusal to have a proper debate on Brexit policy. They were planning to unfurl a pro-Remain banner when Corbyn took the stage, though they feared their banner might be confiscated by Momentum heavies.When – after an introductory DJ set that included Prince’s I Wanna Be Your Lover – the leader appeared, the banner was raised, and the Remain group and their banner were quickly ushered out. This allowed the leader of the opposition to enthuse a by-now significantly larger crowd of the converted with impassioned pledges to renationalise “rail, mail and water”, build a million council homes and to “support everybody”, while fans chorused his “Ooh! Jeremy Corbyn” theme tune. Like any headliner worth his salt, he knows to stick to the hits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb4adfc38bea01552951772200f8c15a7d57b788/0_346_5512_3308/master/5512.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=591dc70455be7203b33e121f3945bba2","title":"labour live jezfest london jeremy corbyn scepticism","story":"Jeremy Corbyn and friends reboot socialism at festival as devotees pack the tentsJeremy Corbyn called on festivalgoers at Labour Live to unite to take on inequality and deliver a Labour government to replace a party that is “incapable of governing” in a rousing speech reminiscent of his appearance at Glastonbury last year.Labour supporters gathered in north London on Saturday afternoon for a music and politics event also known as the JezFest, which was attended by around 13,000 people at the White Hart Lane recreational ground.Corbyn was introduced by John McDonnell, who came on stage after a rendition of All You Need is Love, and gave a five-minute speech where he referred to The Magic Numbers who had preceded him with a solid set and pledged that a Labour government would be magical.“I had a dream we’d have a socialist in No 10 and it’ll be this socialist, Jeremy Corbyn!” he said, before giving way to the party leader.Corbyn then arrived to cries of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” and gave a 25-minute speech where he criticised an economy and a society ruled by the free market.“The legacy of the next Labour government will be a national and education service that takes the commodity out of education,” he said.“Under Labour mail, rail and water will come back where they belong into public ownership,” he said. “It will be democratic and it will be well run.”In a speech highly critical of the Tory government he said: “I look in the House of Commons, across the aisle, at a party of the rich, by the rich, for the rich and funded by the rich and I see a party over there that’s ided, incapable of negotiating and incapable of governing.“I see a party that offers nothing to bring about the necessary solutions to people’s problems in our society and I simply say to them this: you crept back into office a year ago ... for goodness sake, give up, move on, move over and let the people take over,” Corbyn told the crowd before introducing Reverend and the Makers, who he had introduced in Tranmere last year when the famous chant was born.A erse group of people young and old, black and white, middle and working class wandered across the grass between stages throughout the day, as the crowd steadily grew in number.The tents were packed throughout the day, which had intervals of sunshine, although the music was relatively less well attended. The MP and former trade unionist Ian Lavery got a good turnout in the Solidarity tent, along with Dan Carden MP and Len McCluskey for the People’s Question Time.The Literary tent was packed for the  columnist Dawn Foster and editor-at-large, Gary Younge, who talked about how a new generation of Labour voters was interested in bringing the party back to its roots following the 2015 defeat.At the Socialist Bookmarks shop, books on offer included Unravelling Capitalism, the Rebel’s Guide to Gramsci and the Ragged-Trousered Philanthropist.Contemporary leftwing authors were close by, preparing to speak.“Given the overwhleming onslaught of sneeriness, snideness, snarkiness and snobbery about this event from opponents of Jeremy Corbyn, it’s just nice to actually be here and see there’s a whole bunch of people having a nice time,” said Alex Nunns, the author of The Candidate: Jeremy Corbyn’s Improbable Path to Power.“We live in a country where people have been completely disengaged in politics and one party is trying to appeal in a different way and make it a little less dry.”The failure to sell out Labour Live might be evidence of a labouring love for Corbyn’s brand of socialism, but the cult of personality endured among the faithful on an overcast day.Tony Lennon, a retired stage manager from Shropshire, was unconcerned about the initial poor turnout. “It’s not about making money,” he said. “It’s about bringing people who believe in the same sort of thing together. If this is the first time they’ve organised a festival like this, then they’ve done really well. Weather’s not so good, but I think overall it will do the job.”Festivalgoers appeared most concerned about education, housing, wages and the NHS rather than Brexit. The mostly remain voters rued the “disaster of leaving the EU”, but said the referendum result must be accepted and it was not among the top of their priorities.“The debate is dominated by pedantic squabbles,” said Chris Saltmarsh, a 22-year-old climate-change campaigner from Liverpool. “There are many more important things for the political elite to worry about.”As the  columnist Owen Jones took to the main stage and restated Labour’s pledge to abolish tuition fees, renationalise industries that “belong to us” and give people a proper living wage to whoops from the crowd, there was a palpable feeling that Corbyn was plugging the right line – to the diehards.A Labour party spokesperson said: “Labour Live has been a fantastic day. We’ve brought people together from all walks of life to have a good time to enjoy the acts and family entertainment, and discuss how we can change our society for the better.“The tents have been packed all day and there has been a great atmosphere. This is the first event of its kind organised by a political party, and we have demonstrated how politics can be opened up to a wider audience and to people who have been shut out for far too long.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f128ea104ad0f2efb7937d3a1b140f63e1792e8/0_167_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7adeee73ecdc6e8d56bf9cb98536587e","title":"leftwing group pushes for uk to stay in the eu at odds with jeremy corbyn","story":"Student organisation NCAFC says it will join anti-Brexit demonstrations this summerA leftwing organisation that led demonstrations against student fees and Conservative higher education reforms has set itself at odds with Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit by pledging to increase its campaigns to keep the UK in the EU and maintain the free movement of workers.The National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts (NCAFC) said it would join anti-Brexit demonstrations the National Union of Students (NUS) is organising this summer and autumn, and establish a “radical, leftwing, pro-migrant bloc”. The move is another sign of young people increasingly mobilising against the UK’s scheduled departure from the EU in March next year.The NCAFC coordinated action and street protests by thousands of students against university fees in 2010 and 2011, and later actions during the Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition government against its wider higher education policies. Christie Neary, a member of the NCAFC national committee, said it was time Corbyn joined the battle to stop Brexit.“The only Brexit is a Tory Brexit – a racist attack on migrants and workers’ rights. Jeremy Corbyn knows that bankrupt hospitals, low pay and failing schools are the fault of bosses and relentless austerity, not migrants. Labour can’t afford to give any more ground to the right. It’s time Corbyn committed to the defence of free movement and workers, and that means leading the campaign to stop Brexit altogether,” Neary said.As the party stages its “Jezfest” music festival in north London on Saturday, pressure from pro-EU Labour supporters for the party to take a clearer anti-Brexit line is growing.MPs and remain activists want the party to abandon its policy of “constructive ambiguity” after Corbyn faced his biggest Commons rebellion by backbenchers last week on a motion about staying in the European Economic Area (EEA).Student organisations representing almost a million young people studying at UK universities and colleges joined forces last month to demand a “people’s vote” on any final Brexit deal as fears grow that leaving the EU will have a disastrous effect on their future prospects.The NCAFC is not formally linked to Labour, but many of its supporters are Corbyn supporters. The rebellion by Labour MPs happened after party whips ordered them to abstain over a motion that backed staying in the EEA. The Labour leadership objected partly because of concerns that membership would mean obeying free movement rules after Brexit, and also because it might make it difficult for the UK to join a customs union and therefore find a solution to the Northern Ireland border issue.Concerns that the party’s stance on Brexit is hitting its support grew on Thursday when Labour’s Janet Daby won the the Lewisham East by-election but with a severely reduced majority.

Despite posting their highest ever one-day score against Australia it was a close run thing. Shaun Marsh, who suddenly became “Glamorgan’s Marsh” as the day progressed, produced a magnificent innings of 131 but England clung on to enough vital late-evening catches to take a 2-0 lead in the series. This was Australia’s seventh defeat in eight matches yet this was a spirited chase on an excellent surface.Marsh cruised to his fourth ODI century and his partnership of 96 with his fellow West Australian Ashton Agar gave his team a chance of registering their highest ever successful run chase. It was looking bleak for England as Liam Plunkett ran in to bowl the 46th over, especially after Moeen Ali had spilt a very tricky chance running backwards. Australia needed 51 runs with four wickets left. Then Tim Paine pulled a slow bouncer straight to Adil Rashid at fine-leg. Two balls later Plunkett bowled Marsh and the match was safe.England may have been disappointed with their record-breaking score: 342 for eight is not a bad total but mayhem in the final few overs of a one-day game has become so commonplace that, as their batsmen left the field, the modern sages were mumbling: “The Aussies pulled that back well at the end.” A mere 42 came from the last five overs.For the first time in ODI cricket the total included five consecutive 50-run partnerships. All the batsmen settled in but the mainstays were Jason Roy, who hit his fifth ODI century, and Jos Buttler, who was unbeaten on 91 when the innings closed. This was a captain’s innings since Eoin Morgan woke with a back spasm and was unable to play.Roy batted silkily, as ever, but with some discretion it was the first time he had passed 50 in his last 10 ODI innings and maybe he was aware that it was time for another major innings, especially since England currently have three opening batsmen in their side while Ben Stokes is absent.Such was the fluency – and orthodoxy – of his stroke play that it was hard not to wonder whether Roy could enhance England’s Test team in the same way that Buttler has threatened to do since his recall this May. After all, his method is not so different from that of Virender Sehwag, who did not fare so badly in Test cricket for India.Of course, one of several key differences is that Sehwag had plenty of exposure to red-ball cricket to justify his place in the Test team. Roy seldom appears in County Championship cricket for Surrey and, when he does play, he does not open the batting. Many more innings like this and a polite request to those at the Oval to elevate him in the order might be worthwhile.For a while Roy had to be content at being outshone by Jonny Bairstow, who must be in the form of his life even if he is not quite capitalising. Against the two unrelated Richardsons, Jhye and Kane, Bairstow unfurled a succession of perfectly timed boundaries as he raced to 42 from 23 balls. Then, seduced by the absence of a boundary fielder at third man, he tried to conjure something in that direction and was caught behind.Alex Hales was more subdued than usual – perhaps he also felt the imperative for a big score – until he was bowled by a fine in-ducking delivery from Jhye Richardson.Amid a couple of frustrating interruptions for rain as well as a nasty moment when Tim Paine, behind the stumps, was hit in the face by an irregularly bouncing ball, Joe Root settled easily enough until he was brilliantly caught by Australia’s debutant, D’Arcy Short, on the square-leg boundary, probably the best and possibly only catch taken by a D’Arcy in international cricket.Buttler purred in the middle of his innings, startling Jhye Richardson with two preposterous ramps over the keeper’s head, both of which went for six. He also unveiled another of his specialities, a smear drive against the left-handed wrist spin of Short, which sent the ball fizzing to the extra cover boundary from a horizontal bat. From here the Australians must have feared the worst but, as partners came and went, Buttler could not quite sustain such brilliance. Even so his 91 took 70 only balls.Australia’s innings began more fitfully than England’s as the sun finally made an appearance and their response would be heavily dependent on Marsh. Travis Head engineered a fine upper cut for six off Mark Wood but then succumbed to a superb one-handed catch at midwicket by Hales. Soon Short was caught neatly at slip by Root off Moeen, who continued to be England’s most effective bowler in this format.Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch fell in swift succession, the former bowled by Plunkett, the latter lbw sweeping at Rashid before he had scored.Glenn Maxwell rallied briefly, hitting Rashid out of the attack with the minimum of fuss, but then he holed out to long-on against the admirable Moeen. Marsh kept battling away with Agar’s assistance until Plunkett’s timely intervention. Hence an unfortunate Australian trifecta was complete."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/869dccaf3cc0e3c663ca92ab8054b0166b5daf94/35_311_3467_2080/master/3467.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=364f78518161137cf3f12352f823d8db","title":"hull fc wigan super league match report","story":"Liam Marshall’s match-winning try – scored after a bizarre sequence of events – ended a difficult spell for Wigan and the sense of relief among their players at full-time underlined the importance of this result.Wigan had lost three successive games in league and cup but a stroke of luck brought their poor form to a conclusion. Sam Tomkins’s drop‑goal attempt had crashed against the crossbar with five minutes remaining but when the ball bounced back Wigan were quickest to react, eventually passing the ball wide for Marshall to touch down and secure a huge result.The win means that, for all the talk of Wigan’s season descending into crisis in the weeks since Shaun Wane’s departure at the end of this season was confirmed, they are now six points clear of fifth-placed Hull and still firmly in control of their destiny this season.Wane denied the announcement of his departure at the end of the season had any effect on the team’s form, saying “we’ve just had a few weeks where we’ve been off”.The Warriors coach said: “There’s been no pressure, I know what they can deliver and what we saw the last three weeks wasn’t Wigan. We showed some decent signs today that we are back into it.”The match, while putting Wigan’s season back on track, represented a missed opportunity for Hull not only to climb back into the play‑off places but also to pull the Warriors back into the scramble for the top four.Most frustrating of all for the hosts was that, as the weather worsened here and the rain poured down by the banks of the Humber, Hull not only led but appeared to be in control of the contest. Their failure to finish Wigan off proved costly.“That will be a frustrating watch on review,” their coach, Lee Radford, said. “The effort was great but that only gets you so far we had an opportunity to be two points behind them and we’ve missed it.”In a game of few clear-cut opportunities, the two sides traded tries in the first half, Dan Sarginson and Bureta Faraimo each touching down.A penalty from the boot of Tomkins put the visitors two points ahead at half-time and as conditions worsened after the break it seemed as though that could prove crucial. Hull, though, went ahead when Faraimo’s second made it 10-8 – though a number of missed opportunities by the hosts thereafter were decisive.Soon after Scott Taylor had the chance to win the game for Hull, Tomkins levelled the scores with another penalty with 10 minutes remaining. It then became a case of who would hold their nerve – though the match was won in peculiar circumstances.

She would be upstairs, 30 metres away, and shout out, “Timothy, are you pouring orange juice from a carton?” I just didn’t understand how she knew.Dad was known for his barbecues at weekends and bubble and squeak on Sundays. We’d all have to set the table and clear the table. We had our own seats, totally structured. When my sister Nel was born, when I was eight or something, my parents decided that I should sit at the foot of the table, with Dad at the other head with Mum to his left and my baby sister to her left. It was a compensatory status move, because my brother was good at everything.I can tell you who ate the fastest as children, the order it went in – it was Katie, born three years after me, Dan, who predated me, then young Nel. Then me, always the slowest.When Dad, who’s a surgeon, came home late for dinner my mother would berate him. She was an amazing woman but there’d be frequent arguments over roast lamb, including: “You care more about your patients than your family.” We’d say, “But he’s saving lives,” so she’d ask: “How can I compete with you being some kind of messiah?” Dad, being so modest, wouldn’t mention: “Today I did a 10-hour operation – I might have lost the patient, but I didn’t.” He had no ego, at home, that I could detect. He certainly doesn’t have the desperation for affirmation that his second son has on stage.In my book for kids, I write: “When I grow up I will eat sweets on the way to work” and “I will have treats every day”. I remember in primary school the most desired thing was “crumb sausage roll on sauce”, as we called it. That’s actually a list – crumb sausage, comma, a roll, comma, and sauce, which was basically a hotdog. You could also get a High C orange juice of 200ml and a cream bun in a paper bag from the tuck shop, and my focus was very much on that.My paternal grandfather bought 1,500 acres to build a hobby farm in what’s now wine country. There were up to 1,000 head of cattle and 2,000 sheep. He kept it going until he was 80 and it was a huge project – I was there half the time. By the age of 10, I knew how to put a rubber ring around the testicles of a splayed male lamb. We could pause here and have a whole complicated conversation about animal sentience, real philosophy. These days I’m a hypocritical philosophical vegetarian. Vegetarianism would be the right choice but I really, really love meat.I lived at home while attending the University of Western Australia in Perth, while doing a gap year and – partly – while attending the academy of performing arts on the other side of town. There’s nowhere to go except a few thousand miles across desert. I worked in bars and restaurants. At the Blue Duck cafe in Cottesloe, where I was never a great barista but did the dishes well, I practised accents – often British – while serving customers. I’d often work 5am-9am, the early breakfast shift, and eat sourdough bread, Vegemite and butter. I ended up buying a flat 300 metres away – because it’s the most beautiful place in the world really.I didn’t woo my wife Sarah with food at university – God no. Except at Burger King’s drive-thru. We were both pretty grotty, absolutely hopeless, feral things.After we moved to London, I recorded a massive eight-minute punk track with a 54-piece orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall about cheese, which I love, but which the next day makes me feel bad. It’s a damaged relationship song. I also attended a dinner party and got into a row with an Australian woman who thought Perth was a shithole. But what really upset me was her talking enthusiastically about homeopathy and breast feeding – something Sarah had gotten into after swallowing all this bullshit from a homeopathist about violet ending nipple pain. I have a feeling of righteousness about how quacks give non-evidential health beliefs and exploit the sufferers. What I believe is that science, not superstition, has caused the average person to live twice as long as a century ago.My most visceral childhood memory is getting home from hockey. Much of our family time revolved around hockey, and it rains a lot in Perth, and we’d get home tired and wet in our tracksuits, and the smell I’d hold in my nose is of mother’s vegetable soup.When I Grow Up is out now in paperback (Scholastic, £7.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4516c7a4927f643fc26d9c775026ade0241651f0/0_63_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d3b9f07fce2c0a415bb3e292241b49f","title":"colombias election peace ivan duque gustavo petro","story":"The shadow of ex-president Álvaro Uribe, a strong critic of the Farc peace deal, hangs over Sunday’s runoff vote between his protege Iván Duque and the leftwinger Gustavo PetroOn a leafy street outside a private university in Medellín, Colombia’s second city, José Botero is plastering cars with bumper stickers. “Vote for Duque,” he shouts to the approval of passing drivers, who honk their horns. “He’s Colombia’s only choice!”Botero is campaigning for Iván Duque, the frontrunner in a bitter presidential race that will conclude on Sunday in a runoff between two candidates from the extremes of the political spectrum. Duque, a conservative from the Democratic Centre party, and Gustavo Petro, a former mayor of Bogotá – and onetime urban guerrilla – are both campaigning on anti-establishment platforms and picked up enough of the vote in last month’s first round to eliminate a handful of moderate candidates. Hanging in the balance in Sunday’s vote is a fragile peace with the former rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) – a deal which Duque opposes and Petro supports.Botero’s mother was still pregnant with him when his father was kidnapped and murdered by the Farc – and like many Colombians, he was disgusted by the peace agreement. The deal, which won the outgoing president Juan Manuel Santos a Nobel peace prize, formally ended a war that left 220,000 dead and 7 million displaced. But its terms – including guaranteed seats in congress for Farc leaders and promises of softer sentencing – proved too much for voters who narrowly rejected the agreement in a referendum in late 2016.The deal was amended and later ratified in congress, but many still want it revised. Duque – who has promised to amend key parts of the deal – promises them that opportunity.“No one is against peace,” said Botero, echoing one of Duque’s talking points. “But we won’t see it with the deal that Santos signed.”Pedro Piedrahita Bustamante, a political science professor at the University of Medellín, said Duque’s camp has exploited isions opened by the peace process. “Colombians are culturally accustomed to war,” he said. “Justice is seen as an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”Duque, a fresh-faced but prematurely grey 41-year-old, spent much of his adult life in Washington DC working at the Inter-American Development Bank, before he was hand-picked for a senate seat in 2014 by former president Álvaro Uribe. Like his mentor, he is a social conservative: tough on drugs and crime and opposed to gay marriage.Much of Duque’s voter base was gifted to him by Uribe, who left office in 2010, but remains a major player in Colombian politics.Uribe’s tenure was dogged by scandal. A state intelligence agency was shut down after he used it to spy on the opposition, journalists and members of the supreme court. His military campaign against the rebels was marked by grave human rights abuses: thousands of civilians were murdered in order to falsely inflate combat statistics.But he commands huge support in his hometown Medellín and the surrounding Antioquia province, which voted overwhelmingly against the peace deal.Colombia has experienced one of the longest internal conflicts in history. It started in the 1960s following a turbulent period known as \u0027la violencia\u0027.\u0026nbspOn the one hand, the Colombian government fought to maintain order and stability, seeking to protect the interests of its citizens and the legitimacy of the state.\u0026nbspOn the other, there were guerilla groups – like Farc and ELN – who said they were fighting for the poor and social justice.And then paramilitary groups emerged, claiming they were reacting to the threats from the guerillas while taking justice into their own hands.More than seven million people were uprooted from their homes and driven to cities fearing for their lives.\u0026nbspAt least two hundred thousand people lost their lives.Numerous human rights violations were committed. Hundreds of people were forcibly recruited and taken far into the Colombian jungle to fight. More than 8,000 cases of child recruitment were recorded.Overall, there have been more than eight million victims, due to the conflict. One out of every five Colombians has been directly affected.After talks lasting more than four years, a peace treaty was signed with Farc in November 2016 effectively bringing the conflict to an end. Key to the agreement are deals on rural development, political participation, illicit drugs and reparations for victims.Farc has given up all of their weapons (verified by the UN) and transitioned into a political party with a voice in the political process.With less money tied up in defence, the country\u0027s spending priorities should now be switching to education, health, infrastructure, the economy and the environment.\u0026nbspBut some are yet to experience \u0027peace\u0027. Scars are deep. Reconciliation, reintegration and access to opportunities take time. President Juan Manuel Santos is due to stand down in 2018 and some election campaigning has stoked concerns over the peace deal.“Like him or hate him, Uribe has been a force in every major election since 2002 when he first came to power,” Piedrahita said. “And here in Antioquia he is the king.”Uribe is constitutionally barred from re-election, and although both men have vehemently denied that the former president would have any say in government if his protege is elected, many see Duque as his puppet.Before Duque announced his candidacy, many Uribe supporters had already pledged their vote to the former president’s cause. Billboards appeared on rural highways, emblazoned with the words “whoever Uribe says”.“Uribe is the best president Colombia has ever had,” said Johnny Andrés Copete, a civil servant who moonlights as a community organiser for Democratic Centre. “But Duque is the future now – there’s no ision here.”In Medellín, support for Duque is practically universal. Cars are plastered with his campaign’s bumper stickers billboards loom over the city showing him with his arms out, as though inviting a hug.José Rodríguez, one of the city’s countless taxi drivers, admitted he had never heard of Duque until a year ago. “But we trust Uribe here – if he could ever run again, I’d vote for him.”Nowadays, the hot-tempered former president presents an image of an affable, grandfatherly figure – but that view is far from universal. Luz Marina Galeano remembers Uribe’s tenure well. She leads a group of women who lost loved ones in one of Medellín’s poorest slums when Uribe ordered a military crackdown on Farc’s urban militias.As army Black Hawk helicopters whirled overhead, more than 1,000 soldiers flooded the streets of the Comuna 13 district, rooting out suspected rebels and their supporters. When the troops withdraw, paramilitaries filled the vacuum, continuing a terror campaign against civilians.“We victims remember the war because we lived it,” said Galeano. Galeano’s husband was accused by paramilitaries of working with the guerrillas, and was last seen being dragged from a bus in 2008. His remains are thought to lie with hundreds of others in a landfill site overlooking the city. “A vote for Duque is the same as voting for Uribe – and it means more war,” she said.Uribe has attempted to undermine several investigations into his involvement in paramilitary massacres, and with Duque at the helm opponents worry the former president could avoid any legal reckoning. A key witness in one investigation recently turned up dead.Steven Levitsky, professor of government at Harvard University and co-author of How Democracies Die, worries that should Duque win, Colombia risks backsliding towards authoritarianism.“There’s certainly cause for concern,” he said. “If you look back at the Uribe presidency, the human rights record was terrible. You saw various attempts to concentrate power and various efforts – some successful – to violate civil liberties.”The question many are asking is whether Duque – who in his rhetoric is more moderate than Uribe – will be able to distance himself from his mentor. “The more distance that appears between the two, the safer Colombian democracy is,” said Levitsky, adding that the leader in modern history to have successfully ruled via a puppet leader is Vladimir Putin. “It may seem that Duque is a political nobody without much political experience or talent, so it looks from the vantage point of today that Uribe should have a pretty easy time of controlling him.”But for Duque’s supporters, he remains the only option regardless of what academics say. His market-friendly approach differs from Petro, who rails against multinational corporations.Petro’s hesitancy in distancing himself from neighbouring Venezuela’s late president Hugo Chávez also opened him up to criticism. More than a million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia to escape their country’s political and economic crisis. Some voters, stoked by bellicose rhetoric, worry that Petro could lead Colombia into similar chaos.“I’m voting for Duque for the salvation of my country,” said Camila Rodríguez, a student in Medellín voting for the first time in her life. “If Petro wins, the Farc won’t answer for their crimes and we risk becoming like Venezuela.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ded2b28d7911a34abff7765aa076aa4472b843/0_265_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38451a10e79ede5cb832a681472b4f84","title":"italy bars two more refugee ships from ports","story":"Matteo Salvini says Lifeline and Seefuchs ships will have to land migrants elsewhereItaly’s interior minister has sparked a new migration crisis in the Mediterranean by barring two rescue boats from bringing refugees to shore, a week after the Aquarius was prevented from docking.Italy’s closure of its ports to the migrant rescue ship Aquarius, which was carrying 620 people, triggered warnings from aid agencies of a deadly summer at sea for people trying to cross the Mediterranean.Axel Steier, the co-founder of Mission Lifeline which operates the Lifeline ship, said his crew had rescued more than 100 migrants off Libya on Friday in an operation with a US warship, and transferred them to a Turkish merchant vessel.He said his ship was too small to make the journey from Libya to Italian ports and that he always transferred migrants to other ships, but insisted those craft should have the right to land in Italy.“I am sure there is an obligation for Italy to take them because its closest safe harbour is Lampedusa. We hand over migrants to Europe because of the Geneva convention,” he said.Vessels chartered by an assortment of European NGOs have plied the waters off Libya for three years, rescuing migrants from leaking boats and transporting them to Sicily.Following Salvini’s decision to prevent the Aquarius from docking, however, Malta quickly followed suit, leaving the vessel stranded at sea until Spain offered to take the ship. It is due to arrive in Valencia on Sunday.Crews of the NGO boats say Salvini’s port closures leaves them without anywhere close by to take the people they rescue, and that the move will prove counterproductive.“It will not stop people coming,” said Ruben Neugebauer, of the German charity ship Sea Watch. “They will come anyway, but more of them will die.”Sea Watch refused last week to take 40 migrants rescued by the US navy ship Trenton off Libya, fearing a fate similar to that of the Aquarius. Trenton waited four days before being allowed to dock in Sicily.Charities say the NGO boats are a vital lifeline, rescuing more than 88,000 people in the past two years, but critics say they are a pull factor, encouraging people to make the dangerous sea journey. More than 600,000 migrants have made the crossing from Libya to Italy in the past four years, and Salvini’s stance reflects frustration that the rest of Europe refuses to take its share of arrivals. At least 13,000 people have drowned trying to reach European shores. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, accused Salvini last week of cynicism and irresponsibility, but at the same time refused to allow the Aquarius to dock at French ports. “Malta and Italy didn’t open their ports, but then most other European governments didn’t help either,” said Izza Leghtas, a senior advocate at Europe for Refugees International. “They are all passing the ball among themselves.“If the NGO boats are unable to land the people they rescue and cease to operate, Operation Sophia, an EU anti-smuggler mission patrolling the Mediterranean, may take up some of the slack. NGOs, however, say its warships operate too far out to sea, given that people traffickers favour towing rubber boats full of migrants to the edge of Libya’s 12-mile territorial waters before setting them adrift."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/813135d786c1fa8aa52716977c8556ecf6908445/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=024162d1435bef99397d9f9b560b463d","title":"thai king signs royal familys 30bn fortune over to himself","story":"King Maha Vajiralongkorn formally inherits assets including the Siam Commercial Bank after death of his father The vast wealth of Thailand’s royal family has formally turned over its assets with more than $30bn to King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who assumed the throne after the death of his father in 2016.An undated announcement seen Saturday on the website of the Crown Property Bureau, which controls the royal wealth, says that assets it has been administering will be put in the same category as the monarch’s personal assets and managed together at his discretion.Forbes magazine’s rankings of the world’s richest people had estimated the fortune of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej at more than $30bn, including the holdings of the Crown Property Bureau. King Vajiralongkorn last year had already asserted personal total control over the bureau.Some holdings in two major companies controlled by the bureau had already been transferred earlier to the new king’s personal control.The new announcement noted that while the Crown Property Bureau had been exempt from taxes and duties, the personal assets of the king and the holdings previously belonging to the Crown Property Bureau to be treated together as ‘Crown Property Assets’ would “be subject to the same duties and taxation as would assets belonging to any other citizen”.The announcement, which was titled Explanatory Notes, also said that the king could direct the existing Office of the Crown Property Bureau, or any other designated person or agency, to manage the assets now held in his name.Vajiralongkorn’s father, King Bhumibol, who reigned for seven decades, had professional managers who were also trusted insiders administer the palace’s business interests. The new king has sought to put his stamp on the monarchy, replacing palace officials with his own appointments.Chirayu Israngkun Na Ayuthaya, who had been director general of the Crown Property Bureau since 1987, was replaced in March by Air Chief Marshal Satitpong Sukvimol, a close aide to King Vajiralongkorn.The Crown Property Bureau’s most notable assets are real estate in Bangkok, Thailand’s capital, the Siam Commercial Bank and the Siam Cement Group, a major building materials conglomerate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c7d28b4bbf0e52b80e9a21abdde5b26911f55ba/85_37_2563_1538/master/2563.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d8975712fe67d2844ec0a1f1823c212","title":"woman swallowed giant python indonesia","story":"Seven-metre snake found during search for woman who had gone to do some gardeningAn Indonesian woman has been found in the belly of a giant python after the swollen snake was captured near where she vanished while tending her vegetable garden, police said on Saturday.The body of 54-year-old Wa Tiba was found on Friday when villagers cut open the seven-metre (23ft) python which was found bloated in the village of Persiapan Lawela on the island of Muna, off Sulawesi.“Residents were suspicious the snake swallowed the victim, so they killed it, then carried it out of the garden,” said local police chief Hamka. “The snake’s belly was cut open and the body of the victim was found inside.”About 100 residents and relatives launched a search for the woman after she failed to return from her garden on Thursday night. Hamka said villagers found the giant serpent lying about 30 metres from Tiba’s sandals and machete, adding she was swallowed head first and her body was found intact.The garden in which she disappeared was at the base of a rocky cliff, pockmarked by caves, and known to be home to snakes, Hamka added.Giant pythons, which regularly top six metres, are commonly found in Indonesia and the Philippines.While they have been known to attack small animals, attempts to eat people are rare.In March last year, a farmer was killed by a python in the village of Salubiro on Sulawesi island."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3532414.1529092591!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"prince and duchess bask in liquid sunshine as god confirms he s a kerryman","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrince Charles and Camilla walk on Derrynane beach in Co Kerry. Photograph: Niall Carson, Getty ImagesThe mayor of Tralee, Norma Foley, and the Cathaoirleach of Kerry County Council, John Sheahan, are waiting for Prince Charles and Camilla Duchess of Cornwall, to arrive at Siamsa Tíre in Tralee.Are they nervous? “You know what it’s like,” says Sheahan. “It’s like waiting for the ball to be thrown at the All Ireland final.”“For the last week we’ve been drowning in Windolene and paint,” says Foley. “Now we can enjoy the view.”The royals were all over the place on Friday morning, with stops here, at Muckross House (where they met a descendent of Daniel O’Connell) and, for the duchess, a barefoot walk on Derrynane beach (“But she wore her tights,” an appalled female colleague says).They’re partially retracing the steps of the Prince’s great great great grandmother who first holidayed here in 1861. “She kickstarted tourism in Kerry really,” says Pat Dawson, the chairman of the theatre’s board.Not everyone is pleased. There was a nationalist protest, one local tells me. “There were two of them,” he says. “One for each side of their banner.”There are also enthusiasts. One man walks by the entrance with a union jack flat cap, flag and a deckchair.Others are more casual. “Hi Charlie!” cries one man when he sees the prince.Some have personal reasons for being here. Inside the theatre, 93-year-old Kathleen O’Shea is wearing two medals, one for service in the second World War. She served in the Army Territorial Service, which was the queen’s unit. “My niece always refers to the queen as ‘my boss’,” O’Shea says. “She said, ‘Why shouldn’t you meet your boss’s son?’”On the other end of the age scale, 60 children from eight local schools line the path outside. “Our kids had to write a formal letter explaining why they should be picked,” says Patricia Sharpe from CBS.“One child used a wax seal,” says another teacher, Angela Moloney, who also makes costumes for the theatre (“If anyone splits their trousers, blame me”). When the Prince and Duchess arrive in a motorcade with an entourage of dignitaries, they greet each child warmly.“I feel like crying,” says Rachel Jordan Banks.“He was funny,” says Alison McEvoy. “He said, ‘I hope you don’t get much homework’ and when we said we did get too much homework, he said, ‘Oh dear.’”“The best day ever,” says Megan Diggins. Why? “No spelling test.”Prince Charles and the Duchess get a private tour of the theatre, which is 50 years old this year, and they watch, among other things, a lovely performance of its very first show, Fadó Fadó. Afterwards, as the Prince is leaving, someone shouts a question about what he thinks of the county.“Remarkable,” he says. “At last I’ve a chance to see Kerry.”A short time later, outside Killarney House, well-wishers are gathering. Sharon Caldwell introduces her little white dog, Fluffy Alfred Caldwell, who is wearing a “royal” blue dicky bow.She and Fluffy, a qualified therapy dog, volunteer their services around nursing homes and she likes the royal couple because of their charity work. “Fluffy’s a royalist, like me, ” she says, “He was born in Wales and my little girl, who’s now in heaven, was from England. ”In the grounds, various dignitaries gather in a marquee listening to trad and eating sandwiches. Danny Healy Rae recalls driving a digger around the grounds when it was being remodelled some years before. “Killarney is well able to welcome this prince to the country,” he says, proudly.Sinn Féin TD and former IRA member Martin Ferris is also here. “My motivation for being here today is to show that we are putting the past behind us and we’re trying to build a new Ireland that’s inclusive of everyone irrespective of their persuasion,” he says. “I’ll just welcome him to Kerry and hope he has a good time and obviously that he’s travelling the journey his great, great, great grandmother took in 1861.”He laughs. “He took a long time to come back.”Eventually, word comes to the master of ceremonies, Michael Rosney, to usher everyone into the beautiful but drizzly garden. “It’s only liquid sunshine,” he says.When the royal couple emerge from the house itself they greet people and, at one point, Prince Charles and Ferris shake hands.Later, someone asks Ferris if it was a warm handshake. “It was,” he says.Did Prince Charles know who he was? “Someone might have told him.”Then there are a few speeches in the garden, including one from Minister for Culture Josepha Madigan, before Rosney inducts the royal couple into the Order of Innisfallen.He predicts we would find out whether God was from Cork or Kerry if he kept the rain away for the duration of the event. “I’d like to confirm that God is in fact a Kerryman,” he says at the end."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3533543.1529178876!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in a party of government mcdonald tells ardfheis","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary Lou McDonald: “A new and better Ireland is emerging.” Photograph: RTÉSinn Féin is a party of government and wants to be part of a “progressive” administration in Dublin after the next general election, party leader Mary Lou McDonald has said.Those who want to keep the party out of office should “wake up and smell the coffee” and realise Sinn Féin is here to stay, Ms McDonald added.The Dublin Central TD rallied delegates at the Sinn Féin ardfheis in the Waterfront Hall, Belfast: “To those who are on an agenda to exclude us, I invite them to wake up and smell the coffee . . . We are here, we are equal.Sinn Féin, she said, will talk to all parties and Independents after the next election. But its “political competitors vie with one another to come up with the best reason to keep us out of government. Let me set a few things straight. We are already a party of government. We are living through a time of great change. The old certainties are gone. The 2½ party system in the South has been consigned to history. Leadership is shifting to a new generation.”In her keynote leader’s speech, Ms McDonald also said the party’s policy on abortion is now settled. Delegates earlier voted to effectively allow TDs and Senators support legislation to allow for unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy when it comes before the Oireachtas.The party is “united in our determination to see the necessary legislation passed without delay”, she said. “And let me say this loud and clear – the North is next.”Ms McDonald was elected party president at a special ardfheis in February. But this event marks her first full ardfheis, including a live televised speech, since succeeding Gerry Adams.In her half-hour address, she expanded on the theme of a “shared prosperity” first mentioned in her acceptance speech upon becoming party leader.“Our agenda is a shared prosperity fuelled by ambition and driven by opportunity. Sinn Féin will deliver for those who struggle to make ends meet, despite getting up and working hard every day.“For those who do everything possible to better their lives, and the lives of their families, yet the wolf remains all too close to the door.“A visit to the doctor, the car breaking down, or back to school costs should not be a financial disaster. No parent should have to pay the equivalent of a second mortgage for childcare.“Shared prosperity is also good for business, for enterprise, for innovation and for productivity.”The areas of health, housing and rural broadband were also identified as key policy areas, as well as the building of a “new Ireland”.“Our core objective is the reunification of Ireland, ” added Ms McDonald.On the suspended Stormont Executive, she said: “Let me be clear, a powersharing Executive and Assembly in the North is still the right thing. And we are up for that.”The DUP, she claimed, are in a “fixed, negative space” and are more interested in supporting the Conservative government in Westminster.She repeated that Sinn Féin wants same sex-marriage extended to Northern Ireland and an Irish language act introduced. Abortion reform was not mentioned in the same context, however.She also said the British and Irish governments must convene the Intergovernmental Conference, provided for under the Belfast Agreement, to resolve the impasse. “Unionism cannot and will not hold back the tide of change and equality.”On Brexit, she said the June European Council summit is “crunch time”.“If the British government don’t have a credible acceptable proposal if they cannot demonstrate how they will avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday agreement and citizens’ rights then the Irish Government can call them out.“There can be no question of progressing to the next phase of negotiations in the absence of an answer to the Irish question. This is one test that our Government cannot flunk.”She said there needs to be a “step change in how society views and treats women”.“No half measures of concessions I am talking about full equality. A new Ireland where women are safe, a new Ireland where women are trusted, a new Ireland where women are equally paid.“Ireland is changing. A new and better Ireland is emerging. To those who are impatient for equality and progress, I say, this is your time. This is your home. This is your Ireland.

Next, they extracted soil samples to compare with samples from the Waterloo battlefield.And finally the used analysis of the bullet damage to the jacket to see if it was consistent with the reported injuries sustained by the British Army Officer in the battle.Although DNA from blood stains on the jacket had degraded to a level beyond use for analysis, soil samples showed a very strong similarity in mineral content to the British section of the battlefield. An account from the time identified Sir Thomas as lying overnight in this section of the battlefield after he had been wounded and fell from his horse.Although family history suggests that he was shot twice, examination of three holes on the right sleeve and right side of the jacket showed that they line up with each other suggesting he was only shot once and the musket ball passed through both his arm and side.There is no exit hole on the jacket and the forensic team believe that the ball shattering Harris’ arm saved his life – if it had penetrated his torso directly it may have proved fatal.Harris was found on the battlefield the following morning and taken to the nearest dressing station at Hougoumont farm where his right arm was amputated immediately.The material on the right sleeve of the jacket has been cut from cuff to shoulder, and forensic examination of the cut’s edges suggests that it was made by an instrument sharper than scissors, such as a surgical knife. It is probable that the surgeon who undertook the operation used the same knife to cut the sleeve as to amputate the arm, the team concluded.At a glance | The Battle of WaterlooA diary kept by Sir Thomas, together with other military history and research, was also used to piece together the events and confirm the findings. Prof Shortland added: “We were able to safely confirm the authenticity of the jacket and place it on the Waterloo battlefield. “In so doing, we also gained further insight into the grievous wounds suffered by Harris during the battle, which themselves reflect the experience of those who fought, and died, on that day.”Sir Thomas was born in Whitwell, Rutland, in 1785.  He was one of many officers attending the Duchess of Richmond\u0027s ball in Brussels on June 15th 1815 with the Duke of Wellington when guests received orders to join units after learning Napoleon was advancing. Consequently he, and the others, left immediately in their swallow-tailed court dress coats, which were worn at the battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo.He retired from the army in September 1834 and became Chief Magistrate in Gibraltar.Please review our commenting policySajid Javid reveals his phone was stolen by moped muggersWhite men in the arts living in fear they are too \u0026#39pale, male and stale to succeed\u0026#39, says leading opera singerComment: The British public voted for £350m a week for the NHS.

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelClick to followThe Independent OnlineSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autismStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”Nutritionist reveals truth about health benefits of soya foodsWhen kids run for 15 minutes in school every day, here’s what happens How the military is helping tackle mental health problems Graphic cigarette-style health warnings also effective on sugary drinkPeople without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

But now here she is, a teenager, and we are watching Love Island together.I am a Love Island virgin, which are three words you won’t hear together very much over the next eight weeks. I have never seen it before, and am only vaguely aware of it. That isn’t to say I’m some television snob I’ve watched copious amounts of Big Brother. I do like I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. I have caught myself laughing at Mrs Brown’s Boys. I even saw The Chase once.But somehow, Love Island has been slightly beyond the periphery of my experience. I mean, I’ve never seen The Only Way is Essex, but I feel like I have. Love Island, though… my reality TV filter must be clogged, and the past three\u0026nbspseries of it have been caught up in the webbing, never really permeating even my subconscious mind.I have a vague idea that Love Island is some combination of castaways having to undergo Bear Grylls-style survivalist trials crossed with the sort of orgy the Marquis de Sade might have dreamed about after eating a particularly pungent cheese too close to bedtime.So, here we are, settling in front of ITV2, my teenage daughter and I. My wife questions the wisdom of Alice encouraging me to watch a programme which, she informs me, will feature a parade of nubile young women in bikinis, as though I am a pensioner in a comedy sketch who might have a heart attack. But I am insistent Alice and her friends have been frantically Snapchatting all evening in excitement at the prospect of series four of Love Island. This will help me get down with the kids, I am sure of it.I ask Alice for a brief précis of what it’s all about as the titles start. She tells me that there will be more boys than girls and everyone has to couple up but the spare boy then has to steal a girl from\u0026nbspone of the others and at the end of the first round the boy without a girl is unceremoniously dumped from the show.How utterly awful, I think. And is there a point to it all? Apparently, yes £50,000 for the last couple standing. And, apparently, “Instagram promotions”, whatever that might entail. But wait monogamy is not the name of the game. Every so often there has to be a process of “recoupling”, says Alice, which sounds to me like something unpleasant from an episode of 1970s sci-fi series Logan’s Run.This, I ponder, is going to be an interminable couple of months. Surely they must do something other than pant over each other? Yes, Alice says. There are tasks and challenges. What, like they have to catch fish and find coconuts and stuff?A glamour model from Essex  who says: I’m definitely more about personality.Londoner Josh, coming to the Island with A-lister stories such as: Anthony Joshua once put me in a headlock for having a terrible haircutBlue-eyed model from Plymouth swapping the catwalk for Love Island.Coming from South Wales, Rosie\u0027s a solicitor: I’m like Legally Blonde… Only Legally Brunette”Student from York: I’m a party animal and I think you really get to know somebody when you go clubbing with them.Recognise the name? Yes, she\u0027s the daughter of Eastenders actor Danny Dyer. From East London, the barmaid says: I am a girly girl. Having a friendship with a girl in the villa is just as important as finding romance.Coming from Newcastle, the personal trainer and gym director says: “I would say I’m a ten out of ten. Maybe a nine out of ten... I’m not good at washing the dishes.”A West End performer from London, Samira says: I’m looking for an experience that I’ve never had before, loads of fun, the opportunity to meet a really nice guy, or even a best friend, and the chance to find myself.A model from Liverpool, Harley says: “My nickname from my friends is a, maybe because I always go after what I want and I always get it.From Staffordshire, the Nuclear Systems Design Engineer says: “I’m looking for a partner, I’m looking for someone I can settle down with and tame my wild lifestyle.”The retail manager and part-time model from Blackpool says: “I don’t do my nails, or have hair or lash extensions. Everything on me is real I am who I am.”An A\u0026ampE Doctor who has already angered the Daily Mail by taking time off his job to appear on the ITV show, Alex comes from Carmarthen, West Wales. He says: I don’t like high maintenance girls. I think it’s brilliant to look good but spending three hours to get ready to go and walk on the beach is too much for me.Another model, this one from London. I have a fun energy and I am a spiritual person, he says. I’d like to think I have a depth to me so I guess that stands out and I look at things quite deeply.The oldest person to join this year\u0027s competition, Laura is a air hostess from Stirling, Scotland. “The emoji that best describes me is probably the blonde girl, she says, because I’m just a weirdo cause I’m always just like, \u0027Hey, soz about me.\u0027A student and construction worker who has a Hermione Granger\u0027s wand tattoo on his arm. Niall says: “My ex would probably say that I’m immature and a bit of an attention seeker - and she wouldn’t be wrong.”Last but not least, we have a Stationary Sales Manager from Kent. “I consider myself really good looking and so far in my life I’ve had no complaints, he says. I get lots of compliments.”She laughs. No, not like that at all. And as the first of the female contestants begins to arrive, I start to understand. This is not so much Bear Grylls as Bare Arse. The girls are deposited at a posh hotel inidually, via Jeep, dressed in the teeniest, tiniest of bikinis. There is Samira, who is a dancer, Hayley, who is a model, Kendall, who manages a shoe shop. They are wearing a handkerchief’s worth of fabric between them. By the time Danny Dyer’s daughter rocks up, I am secretly wishing someone would put some clothes on. I must be getting old.I lose track of who is who because I’ve had a sudden moment of dissonance. The voiceover guy has a Scottish accent that sounds awfully familiar. It is Iain Stirling, Alice informs me. “Don’t you remember? He used to be on CBBC.”Oh my God. He’s the fresh-faced young chap who used to come on with Hacker T Dog. I always had a fondness for Hacker because he was from Wigan, like me. And now his mate Iain is narrating this cesspit. I look at my daughter, and remember those years of Tracy Beaker and Dora the Explorer. Truly, the days of innocence are over.I ask Alice, cautiously, nervously, if she looks up to these girls, whose makeup has more mass than their clothing and who are talking about willies. She rolls her eyes. “It’s just entertainment, Dad.” I think there are five practically naked girls cavorting on screen now, but to be quite honest I’m eyeing up the fire pit on the sun terrace. Is it gas powered? Where does the canister go?But here comes Caroline Flack, presiding over things like some brothel keeper in a Wild West frontier town. Because that’s exactly what it feels like when the boys turn up, one by one, like cattlemen who have been on the trail too long, excitedly wringing their stetsons and being invited by Flack to inspect the lineup of girl flesh on offer and take their pick.Oh, the girls do have a tiny bit of agency they are allowed to take a step forward if the boy in front of them takes their fancy. But ultimately, the guy gets to choose, though I am told these roles reverse in the coming days.The boys are all rippling six packs and tattoos. There’s one called Niall, who seems sweetly funny, and a guy called Wes, who claims to be some kind of engineer in the nuclear industry, except he’s having trouble saying the word “nuclear”. He gives up and falls back on some double entendre, which I’m 100 per cent sure some researcher has not written for him, promising with a leery wink to “engineer the ride of someone’s life” and then, if that was a bit too subtle, says something about having a big gear stick.My wife, no doubt thinking ahead to getting up at 6.30am today, wonders just how these people get eight weeks off work to do this. And that’s never more pressing a question than when Alex turns up. He’s an A\u0026ampE doctor. How can they spare him? He’s presumably done six years of medical school so he can try to crack off with a girl on a televised Club 18-30 holiday. Doesn’t he know how hard-pressed the NHS is? Hasn’t he seen 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE?Half an hour in and I try to get into the spirit of things by betting my daughter a fiver (I know, I know, the sheer crimes of moral turpitude we have descended to) that a boy whose name sounds like\u0026nbspEeyore, but is Eyal, will pick Samira, the dancer, who seems quite switched on compared to the others. I lose the wager. I’m disappointed in Eyal. I thought he had more about him.We meet Jack, who has the most astonishingly white teeth I have ever seen in my life. Apparently he went all the way to Turkey to get them done. You could see the glow of his teeth from the International Space Station.\u0026nbspI have drifted off when someone says, in what context I know not, that it’s “too soon to spoon!” Is it too soon to switch over and watch Lucy Worsley cosplaying a suffragette, I wonder?By this point I am finding it all quite dreadful, and not because I’m old. It’s because it reminds me of what it was like to be young. If you were ever left standing tearfully at the end of musical chairs, if you ever were picked last for games, if you ever walked home alone from a disco and listened to “How Soon Is Now?” by The Smiths on repeat while staring mournfully at your Betty Blue poster, if despite your best efforts you could only ever cultivate the physique of Little Plum from The Beano, then Love Island is a hateful parade of everything you wanted to be but weren’t.I look at Alice. God, I think, please don’t ever be so shallow as these people. But she’s on Snapchat with her friends. One of them likes Jack, he of the luminous gnashers. Alice pulls a face. Who do you like best, I ask? Eyal.Back on screen, Eyal is indeed coming across as, relatively, deep. He is trying to explain to Hayley, the model, what the word “superficial” means. There’s a new guy arrived, called Adam, whose job is to break up one of the couples and get his chosen girl to be with him. It’s becoming like a standard night out, except there are no fights. Apparently giving someone who tries to steal your girl a good shoeing is verboten and gets you kicked out.A little too late, perhaps, I start to wonder if this is really appropriate for Alice. But she has already seen the latest season of 13 Reasons Why, and also informs us that she has watched a movie called Ibiza that is trailed in the ad break which seems to be very heavy on jokes revolving around male ejaculation. Where did those Dora the Explorer days go? When Adam is going round trying to steal girls I want to shout at the screen, “Swiper no swiping!” But it would just make me sad.Everyone goes to sleep, the “couples” sharing beds. They are young and full of self-esteem, and no one is in their forties\u0026nbspand worried about snoring or accidental nocturnal flatulence. As far as I can tell, nobody has sex, which is a relief. It’s probably the best night’s kip Alex the A\u0026ampE doctor has had for years.The full line up for Love Island 2018 has been announcedWhy we need to stop being snobby about Love IslandLove Island bosses used Tinder to find contestants for the new seriesLove Island bosses are thinking of making an LGBTQ versionAre you embarrassed watching this with me, I ask.\u0026nbspAlice shrugs. “Not on the first episode,” she says. “I probably would be, later on.” It will, I am told, get heavy later on. I am slightly aghast. People will actually have sex? On the telly?There was one couple that didn’t last year, says Alice. One couple that didn’t do it? Only one? I’m not sure whether to feel proud of them or sorry for them.It feels like this is going to be a very long eight weeks, daily doses of people pretty much doing the same thing over and over again. A bit like Dora the Explorer. And even with the salacious promise of off-screen sex among these beautiful, vacuous people, I imagine it’s going to be less the Marquis de Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom than 56 Days of Sod All.It’s too much time to devote to these people, and I’m afraid Alice might be on her own – with her pals on Snapchat of course – for the rest of Love Island. I gave it a go and it at best bored me, at worst made me feel vaguely angry and depressed.Though I might tune in tonight, just to see who gets kicked out after last night’s cliffhanger…Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen.

Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities.

When I did, one asked:\u0026nbsp“Can we pray for you?”I asked why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk the streets of DC\u0026nbspand let God’s voice tell them who might be “broken” or otherwise need prayer.As a Christian, I’m opposed to neither prayer nor people praying specifically for me, at least not when it’s done in good faith.But I’m also a transgender woman, and I was dressed in gorgeous makeup and clothing and earrings. I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1723 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2223 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”.

I’ve tried so hard to get through to someone at the Home Office, but I got nothing,” he said.“When I got to the UK, I explained to the government why I was here. They know everything about what I’ve done for this country – how I put my life at risk. But they ignored everything. It felt like I was being punished.”Mr Husseinkhel urged that policy should change to help other interpreters who are still “in limbo”. He said: “I have lots of other Afghan interpreters who have put their lives on the line but are still waiting. The Home Office has let down interpreters. They put us in a really horrible situation.“I didn’t leave Afghanistan because I wanted to. I was in danger and was putting my family in danger there.

What they gave us was insights into the culture, the background. They could really help us to understand what was going on,” he told The Independent.“We need a change in policy. There’s a better way of doing this. These interpreters shouldn’t have to apply for asylum. We should be looking after people who we relied on.

She has previously told The Independent she\u0026nbspwants to keep Britain in the customs union and single market, a stance which could put her at odds with Jeremy Corbyn.Labour retained a majority of 5,629, far below the 21,213 won by Heidi Alexander in the 2017 general election. Ms Alexander triggered the by-election when she took a job in City Hall as Sadiq Khan\u0027s deputy mayor for transport.And with just 33 per cent of eligible voters turning out to cast their ballots, the remain-backing Liberal Democrats saw more than a five-fold increase in their vote share, leap-frogging the Conservatives into second place.Speaking to reporters after the result was declared, Ms Daby said she had found voters in Lewisham still did not want to leave the EU, let alone face a hard Brexit putting up barriers to trade with the rest of Europe.Her victory showed that we will not tolerate an extreme Brexit in Lewisham East”, Ms Daby said.Explaining her experience on the doorstep during the campaign, she said: One of the ongoing issues is to do with Brexit and people not wanting an extreme Brexit and ideally people not even wanting to leave the EU.I will oppose an extreme or a hard Brexit. I will consider people\u0027s jobs, the economy and people\u0027s rights and that will dictate to me the precedent in how I will conduct myself both within Parliament and out of Parliament.Grenfell represents everything wrong with country, says CorbynCorbyn suffers biggest Brexit rebellion as six frontbenchers resignLabour MP Heidi Alexander resigns to become London deputy mayorLeaving Europe \u0027could slash billions from NHS budget\u0027Janet Daby wins Labour candidacy for Lewisham East byelectionMs Daby faced stiff competition to be on the Labour ticket from Lewisham’s powerful branch of the pro-Corbyn movement Momentum. Asked if she would clash with the party leader over Brexit, she pointed out that she had voted for Mr Corbyn at two Labour leadership elections.“Obviously within politics not everybody will agree on everything,” she said. “For me it\u0027s about ensuring that we have as close a relationship to the EU as possible and that\u0027s what I\u0027ll be arguing for and that\u0027s what I\u0027ll be putting forward my views on.”Despite the victory, there will be concerning signs for the party in Ms Daby’s vote share of 50.2 per cent - down from the 67.9 per cent won by Ms Alexander in 2017, when turnout was 69.3 per cent.The Lib Dems heralded the nearly 19 per cent swing to them from Labour, as well as the collapse in Conservative support, as showing who “the real opposition here” was.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlinesThis wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

She said: “We have turned around a massive increase in our vote share. We\u0027re back and people are starting to notice.”Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, said the result “sends a message to the Labour leadership that it cannot take pro-European voters for granted”.He said: “This is the largest swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats in over a decade and the failure of Labour\u0027s leadership to oppose the Conservatives\u0027 hard Brexit cannot be hidden or forgotten.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It was seized by German forces during the First World War and was returned under the terms of the Versailles Treaty, only to be taken back by the Nazis in 1942 and eventually returned to Ghent with the help of the “Monuments Men” (curators and professors who recovered countless artworks stolen by the Nazis).Adolf Hitler was never able to admire the complete work, however, as two of the panels, The Just Judges\u0026nbspand St John the Baptist, had been stolen from the cathedral\u0026nbspin 1934.In the months after the theft\u0026nbspauthorities were sent a series of ransom notes demanding one million Belgian francs in cash.\u0026nbspThe St John the Baptist\u0026nbsppanel was recovered during\u0026nbspnegotiations but the other missing section was never returned.A few months later a 57 year-old money exchange agent, Arsene Goedertier, died of heart failure shortly after revealing that papers relating to the theft were at his home in Wetteren.An envelope containing copies of 13 ransom notes was found in his desk, along with an unsent final letter suggesting that the missing panel “rests in a place where neither I nor anybody else can take it away without arousing the attention of the public”.Conspiracy theories involving the Knights Templars and the Holy Grail have flourished ever since, and several people have claimed to have broken the thief’s secret code.The new theory is based on the scribbled words left on the final note: oiseau, arte, jean, nina, erpe and fourrure, along with the number 152.Mr Marchal said he found locations linked to four of the words that were all 152m from a single point on the Kalandeberg. Plotting the routes also spelt out the letters for the name Nina, he claimed.Further details are outlined in his book The Fourteenth Letter\u0026nbspwith Marc de Bel, who is more famous as the author of the children’s books\u0026nbspThe Egg of Uncle Trotter and Master Plume and the Talking Powder.The masterpiece used as a dartboardMr De Bel described the case as “one of the great art robberies of all time”, and added: “We are waiting for a call from Steven Spielberg now.”“This is of great importance for the city and for Flemish art history,” said the mayor of Ghent.“If this new theory was no more than a stunt to promote a book, I would never have cooperated, and as a city we would not have made our council hall available for a press conference.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A prime minister without a clear parliamentary mandate willing to commit the country to a reality which will not be possible to change,” Mr Mitsotakis\u0026nbspsaid.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All these answers explained.1 of 25Mr Field has said one of the good side-effects of Brexit \u0026ldquoshould be the abolition of the upper House and its replacement by a much smaller senate.He wrote in the : \u0026ldquoLeaving the EU was never a one-stop goal.\u0026ldquoIt was a crucial political objective only because it will allow us to settle all the big issues facing the country in our own way and time.\u0026ldquoOur departure should be the starting gun for a renaissance across the whole of public life as a new pride in being British, or English as it is now more often expressed sweeps across our affairs.\u0026ldquoBrexit will galvanise the country to reform as it has not done before. One move in this renaissance may be forced on our tired political elite.The Withdrawal Bill will return to the House of Lords on MondaySenior Conservative backbenchers have said they would support the abolishment of the Lords, while a senior minister warned a further attempt by peers to impose major changes would be a kamikaze move.A pro-Leave government source added: I think there\u0027s now a settled consensus in the Commons that we are well past the point at which the Lords needed to be reformed.\u0026ldquoIt has got to be substantially reduced and then started again. There will be an enormous amount of support for Frank Field\u0027s position.Frank Field will introduce a bill which would scrap the House of Lords as it currently stands Iain Duncan Smith said: I\u0027m with Frank, it is high time for major reform. This time around has shown an abuse beyond anything we have seen before. They are just behaving atrociously - and some of the worst behaviour has been from Conservative peers.The former Tory leader suggested major reform could be achieved quickly by stopping voting rights from large numbers of Lords appointed by parties.This includes those disobeying the Government whip over the Brexit legislation."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/kirsty-and-terrace-houses-975367.jpg","title":"world cup 2018 england fans england vs tunisia record beer sales","story":"Tickets sales for England\u0026rsquos three group games, starting with Tunisia tomorrow evening, have been poor, with far fewer fans travelling to Russia than for previous tournaments due, in the main, to security fears.More than 10,000 made the much longer journey to Brazil four years ago but plummeting relations with Russia after the Novichok poisonings in Salisbury, combined with terrorism and hooliganism fears, have kept fans away this time.As a result, the Football Association has only sold 1,510 tickets for the Tunisia game, 1,872 for Panama and 2,659 for Belgium.The overwhelming majority of fans have chosen to stay at home and watch the drama unfold on TV.

Without that ultimate weapon we are certain to get a poor deal.The Prime Minister cannot accept what a small handful of Remainers determined to stop Brexit are demanding.As she has rightly said, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.The people said leave, not leave when the EU gives us permission.The EU Withdrawal Bill, which MPs voted on this week, is about ensuring legal certainty at our point of departure.Jeremy Corbyn voted against the Government on this key bill, cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends.If Conservatives do not demonstrate discipline in support of Theresa May on this, then we risk letting him into power.The Government has already said the EU Withdrawal Bill can be framed so as to give Parliament a vote on the final outcome, but without blocking the UK’s departure even without a deal.The Bill will go back to the House of Lords on Monday, and is likely then to return to the House of Commons.We need to get this out of the way, because it is 14 months on from triggering Article 50 and we still have not discussed the vital trade relationship between the UK and the EU.This is because the EU Commission deliberately set out to ensnare the UK in a tortuous bureaucratic process designed to leave us in the weakest position, bound to the EU as some sort of vassal state — as a rule-taker.In this, the EU has been emboldened by the appalling behaviour of the unelected House of Lords, which made it clear they want to reverse the result of the referendum. One peer even spoke arrogantly of now bringing the British people to heel.You only need to have watched as the EU’s negotiators have gratuitously and remorselessly set out not just to be difficult but, it has become clear, to humiliate us.For example, their refusal to agree to our continuing involvement in the Galileo satellite project, despite the fact that we have invested heavily in it, demonstrates how their behaviour has been calculated to offend.Even the UK’s offer of defence intelligence co-operation, which the EU needs, was brushed aside.That the EU is now strutting like the school bully should not surprise us, because of its ideological commitment to the European project at all costs.Yet, for all their bluster, this masks a weakness.The EU is deeply worried the UK will leave the EU and become a serious trade competitor, thus not only damaging the EU’s trading position but encouraging those in the EU who oppose this centralised, protectionist behemoth.We have reached a critical moment in the Brexit process. Because of the EU’s inflexibility, the Government has been forced to make concessions in the hope of discussing that all-important trade relationship.This has left many of us concerned that the process has been too one-sided.The UK has been behaving as a friend who wants an amicable divorce, while the EU has behaved like an opponent who wishes to impose their will and force the UK to repent what they believe is the folly of Brexit.That is why the UK needs now to change its negotiating stance, once the Brexit bill is passed.Too often it seems as though it is the UK which negotiates as a supplicant — despite the reality that, as the EU’s largest trade partner and the fifth largest economy in the world, with the world’s fourth most potent defence forces, the UK is deserving of much more respect from the EU.After all, there is a great deal at stake for the EU if these negotiations go wrong.There are many among the EU 27 who, like us, are growing weary of the EU’s arrogance. After all, it is many of them who stand to lose jobs if we fail to reach a trade arrangement.The EU Council meeting later this month has now become critical. It is there we should say that, notwithstanding any ongoing issues concerning the Irish border, our requirement is we move now to negotiate our post-Brexit trade relationship.If they refuse, and want instead to continue their border demands, then we must have the resolve to leave the table.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So far all I’ve come up with is Iggle Piggle, from TV’s In The Night Garden.I think negotiating Brexit would be a stretch for the friendly blue woollen creature with the red Mohawk.But maybe I’ve got him wrong, underestimated his abilities. He has a bell in his left foot. Theresa May seems to have a brain in her left foot. Given the choice, maybe I’d take the kid with the bell.We are in chaos. Not because we voted for Brexit, far from it. The economy is doing well. The sky has not fallen in. Investment up, employment hitting record levels, inflation down.No, the problem is solely a consequence of our Government. Right now we don’t know exactly what deals have been done with the rump of Remainers within the Conservative Party.One moment we’re told the Prime Minister has caved in to their demands. Next minute she hasn’t. Nobody knows quite what to believe.She is tip-toeing between the two sides solely to stay in power. And she has to be told: It isn’t working. It sends out a message to the people we are negotiating with that we haven’t a clue what’s going on.That policy is formulated on the hoof. In fact, it’s not policy at all, just inept fire-fighting. Inept because the flames are spreading — and as a result, our negotiating position becomes weaker by the hour.Some will argue May can only play the cards she has been dealt. That she has a minority Government and a split in her own party.Well, sure. But then, to a considerable degree, she dealt the cards herself. She called an election a year ago expecting to get a huge majority.I could have told her she would lose, if she’d asked. But she didn’t ask me, she asked some other numbnuts instead. This holy mess is of her making.Britain voted to leave the EU. Not to stay in bits of it. Not to remain constrained by the EU’s regulations. The Remainers don’t like that?Don’t care. You lost the argument — so shut up for a while. Or work to get us the best deal we can, outside the customs union.We need to be clear to the EU negotiators that we will happily take a no deal Brexit. They don’t want that — and a tough line will make them respond. If it doesn’t — fine, no deal is still much better than a bad deal.The EU is falling apart, largely for the reasons that convinced us to leave. Bullying, dictatorial, corrupt, undemocratic.We need a leader who can exploit their manifest weaknesses. A lot — perhaps a majority — of European people are on our side.That leader isn’t Theresa May. It needs to be someone within the Tories who is A. a Leave voter and B. has a bit of charisma and nous.I don’t really care who, right now, David Davis, Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Michael Gove. But ABM — Anyone But May.It is not the EU that is hampering our exit strategy. It is our own Govern­ment. It’s time for Theresa to say: “That’s it: I’m out.”Now, quiz fans, here’s a question for you. What do Terry and Andraya possess that may have helped them come first and second?Jet-powered roller skates? Performance- enhancing drugs? Nope.They were both born with male bodies. And they both competed as boys until very recently.But according to the growing trend, they are now able to identify as girls without question. And so are allowed to compete against girls.And that’s what happens. They win because of biology.SHOULD the Royal Family be allowed to get their baps out?

Well done, Shriver.IN Cretins Corner this week are the libtards criticising President Trump for his attempts to make peace with North Korea.Six months ago these same people were screaming that Trump was leading us all to death and destruction by threatening Kim Jong-un.Now he’s accused of cosying up to a horrible dictator.Truth is, he’s played it brilliantly. Acting tough brought the porky dog-muncher to the negotiating table.And now we have at least a chance of peace in the world’s second most dangerous area (after the Middle East, natch).Barack Obama was bunged a Nobel Peace Prize for, essentially, doing nothing, by the liberals who run the awards.How about one for The Donald for actually achieving something?IS Sadiq Khan going mad?The Mayor of London has demanded that Wikipedia must “close the gender gap” on its entries.

We expect that around 1,000 claimants will be affected.I am absolutely committed to ensuring that disabled people and people with health conditions get the right support they need.The Work and Pensions Secretary faced embarrassment this morning when a damning report blasted the roll-out of the flagship Universal Credit benefits reform."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000413428152.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ministers admit britain could plunge into legal abyss if brexit deal stalls","story":"A crisis meeting between the Brexit Department and Leader of the House of Commons concluded the Government will run out of time to bring in a dozen vital exit laws before exit day next March if they wait until November to start.If and when a deal is struck with Brussels and Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill will be needed to bring it in force, as well as other new laws to get Britain Brexit ready.If it is not ready then Britain will be left in a “legal limbo land” and out of the EU without a deal.But Commons timetabling boss Andrea Leadsom warned they will take months to travel through Parliament and face wrecking attempts from die-hard Remainers.She warned fellow ministers that with only a wafer thin working majority the Government would be unlikely to be able to use special Expedited Legislation measures that can speed things up in an emergency.A source said the meeting on Tuesday “was real doomsday stuff, that left Brexit ministers in no doubt that time is really running out.”And she has warned that even if the Commons sat through the night for days on end, they would still run out of time unless they start in October.However, as James Forsyth reveals in his Sun column today, Theresa May’s closest allies believe a deal with Brussels will not be done until November.The fresh headache comes as angry backbencher Remainers accused hardline Brexiteers of “hijacking” the PM as bitter public sniping continued over Mrs May refusal to grant them a veto on a “no deal” exit.The Government provoked the anger of Tory Remainers on Thursday with proposals which they say fall well short of the truly meaningful vote they are seeking on the way forward if Parliament rejects the agreement obtained by Mrs May with Brussels or if no deal is reached by January 21.And after successfully averting rebellion earlier this week, Mrs May is now facing a mega-showdown with Rebels when the issue returns to the Commons next Wednesday.Last night rebel Antoinette Sandbach blamed David Davis for forcing Mrs May to take a headline, saying: “What seems to have happened is very late in the day that DExEU got involved and it looks like the process was hijacked.”But friends of the Brexit Secretary hit back to ridicule the idea they would not have a central role in shaping the Withdrawal Bill that is the responsibility of their department.A Government spokesperson said: While we share with the EU the intention to agree a deal by October, we are ready for all scenarios.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Working mothers are often the most motivated and dynamic workers in the room.And yet working mothers still get seriously bad press.The comments by Kelly Brook this week are a case in point.She said on TV’s Loose Women some working mothers use their children as an “excuse” to skip deadlines or miss work.She also said it’s unprofessional for women to talk about children in the workplace and that “professional” women never do so.Kelly — who doesn’t have any children — made the remarks during a discussion about whether it is a mother’s job to look after her sick children.I honestly wonder what her views are founded on.Since she started modelling when she was still a teenager, it’s hard to imagine she has ever worked any kind of nine-to-five job in an office.And has she ever employed any working mums? I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She wants to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in.Those who snarkily accuse her of self-promotion are missing the point.Meghan is canny enough to realise her new position in life means she will ­constantly be photographed and written and talked about.She knows that a new hairstyle or frock will steal the headlines but will hope people will also listen to what she has to say on poverty in Africa, equal rights for women and saving elephants.Meanwhile, her old life could be luring Meghan back to La La Land with news that her performance in Suits has been submitted for an Emmy award.A submission is a long way from a nomination, but it will be interesting to see if those in charge fast-track her into the awards category for best actress. ­Personally, I don’t think it will happen.Even Meghan would admit she wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best actor in Suits.If Meghan was nominated and ended up winning, it would be nothing more than a stunt to get some sort of seal of royal approval.Surely even the US entertainment industry wouldn’t be that cynical.Since Meghan met Harry, she has been compared to Grace Kelly, the Hollywood star who gave up her career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco.Unlike Grace Kelly, who wanted to go back into movies, I don’t see Meghan being in any way tempted back to her old life after landing the best role of all.That’s not a criticism because I admire her work ethic and single-mindedness — and I think her desire to be a force for good is genuine.The Queen is nobody’s fool and if she thinks Meghan is worth cultivating and training, the new ­American Duchess should have our approval, too.THE two new judges being wooed to join The X Factor could very well save this show’s rather tired-looking format.Robbie Williams is an inspired choice, bringing his own brand of cheeky humour but also a real empathy for all those seeking fame and fortune.I reckon, however, his wife Ayda could prove to be the real star.She’s funny, feisty and has proved to be a TV favourite during her appearances on Loose Women.Ayda won’t take any nonsense from the formidable Simon Cowell and, much as she loves Robbie, you can expect some straight-talking spats between them.Of course there are those who will say she’s only getting a seat on the judges’ panel because of her husband’s fame, but I reckon Ayda , left with Robbie, is more than up to the job and will be a much needed breath of fresh air on a panel that was looking increasingly bored and out of touch.ON World Blood Donor Day this week I repaid my debt to the NHS when my fantastic TV show team donated their very own blood (having already given their sweat and tears on a daily basis).I had to have a life-saving three pints of blood after a serious accident and, like every other patient who is given a transfusion, I am no longer allowed to donate my own.Where can I give blood? Here’s how to find a donation centre and how often you’re able to donateIt’s something that has made me feel very guilty, so I cannot thank my team enough – although there would have been even more of the precious life-saving blood if some of the boys who work with me and happen to be gay had not been banned from donating.Gay men who have had recent sex are not allowed to be donors, which surely is an edict that needs to be changed.There has to be a way to ensure safety without making gay men feel like pariahs.IN Hollywood, money talks and the box office dictates trends.So It’s good news that the all-female Ocean’s 8 has trounced the other male-dominated movies in the franchise, because it clearly shows moviegoers WILL happily pay to see films starring women in leading roles.Ocean’s 8 is a rather silly but hugely enjoyable spin on the heist movie with a satisfying end twist and decent parts for women – who are all too often usually “the wife” or “the best friend”.It shows that the appallingly bad all-girl version of Ghostbusters, a real stinker that bombed horribly, was just a blip.Hopefully, this will be the start of more big- budget films with kick-ass roles for women that aren’t twee or patronising.ALL my fellow Holby City fans know that surgeon Jac Naylor would make a polar bear shiver if she gave it one of her “looks”.She’s the ultimate ice maiden, although we have seen a little bit of a thaw in recent weeks on her return to our screens.In fact, Jac showed her human side when the character had a breakdown on screen, something that Rosie Marcel, who has played the character for 13 years, knows all about.Rosie told me that she suffered her own mental health problems after having a real-life breakdown on set.She suffered from depression and had to seek medical help.Rosie walked out of her house in her pyjamas and bare feet and even had the dark thought that her family would be better off without her.Luckily, she was given treatment and was able to get back to work, but it was a frightening time and demonstrates once again that mental health problems can hit anyone.I salute Rosie for being so open and brave about her struggle.FASTEN your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride in Poldark when the admirable Rebecca Front sails into Truro harbour like a magnificent galleon as the formidable Lady Whitworth.This ghastly harridan is the mother of the monstrous Ossie Whitworth, who has made his reluctant wife Morwenna suffer the torments of hell and even had his wicked way with her sister.If you wondered how Ossie could be so self-centred, heartless and cruel, then all will be explained when his mother heaves into view.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many offer playgrounds or activities like climbing and zipwires. And lots have cycle-friendly paths for off-road bike trips.

Now temporary staff at Foxconn factory in Hengyang, China, are being offered contracts, with sick and holiday pay. And managers have been told to hire more workers to reduce levels of overtime.  Payslips showed Foxconn had paid a flat rate for overtime and regular work, instead of the time and a half required by law. After an audit Amazon told Foxconn to clean up its act. Workers’ rights group Chinese Labour Watch said thousands of staff were hired as temps who did not qualify for sick or holiday pay and could be laid off in slack periods.  Its investigator found 60-hour weeks were the norm at peak periods and some staff did 80 hours overtime a month, the legal maximum is 36. It also claimed many Foxconn staff were on less than half of the average wage. Foxconn told the Sunday Mirror it is revamping its recruitment and admitted at peak periods the number of temporary workers in the factory did “exceed targets and limits”.

The band were a last minute edition to the line up at the festival of politics and music in North London today. She told the Mirror: This event is so incredible and I think with the democratic reshaping of the electorate that we saw last year in the general election is kind of reflected in this because I think so many people have been brought into party politics that weren\u0027t interested before. The festival dubbed Jezfest was originally expecting to welcome 30,000 people to North London, had reportedly sold just 3,000 tickets with around a month to go.     But in recent weeks ticket prices were slashed from \u0026pound35 to \u0026pound10 and the unions stepped in buying batches which they distributed to their members.  Signing up Clean Bandit to headline gave sales a further boost.   A Labour source said more than 13,000 tickets had been sold - with more going on the door on the day itself.   Grace said a late minute change had meant the Rockaby She said: I am a proud Labour supporter, we all are in the band and we really wanted to be here.  It was quite a last minute thing as we were supposed to be somewhere else and it all worked out for the best just a couple of days ago. Grace, who is 32, hit out at the Tories and certain parts of the media who try and silence those they find threatening.  She said of today\u0027s event: I think for people like me who don\u0027t really like reading the news or watching TV even it\u0027s so great to be able to experience politics in a different forum and I think it\u0027s great.  The Tories will do everything they can to squash anything threatening to them and I think the involvement of young people in politics is threatening to them and we just don\u0027t really care.  Jeremy Corbyn has hailed the Labour Live festival a success when he addressed supporters earlier in the day. The one-day showcase of politics, music and arts had been hit by reports of sluggish ticket sales but the party insisted that more than 13,000 were bought ahead of the gathering.  Other events at the festival included a performance by former Sex Pistol Glen Matlock and a World Cup-themed discussion on socialism and football. Talk of poor turn-out led Prime Minister Theresa May to ridicule the festival in the Commons. However, Labour insisted it was a success, with a spokeswoman saying: The tents have been packed all day. This is the first event of its kind organised by a political party and we have demonstrated how politics can be opened up to a wider audience and to people who have been shut out for far too long.  Concerns that the party could be embarrassed by low turn-out saw ticket prices slashed from \u0026pound35 to \u0026pound10 in recent weeks. When the Labour leader took to the stage, supporters chanted the now familiar Oh, Jeremy Corbyn to the tune of Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes.

According to Sky News , the pair, on the libertarian Right of the Conservative Party, regard many private members\u0027 bills as politically correct, nanny state nonsense seeking to meddle in people\u0027s lives and curb their personal freedom. The pair have frequently taken advantage of an archaic quirk of Commons rules in which MPs are prevented from voting on a bill on a Friday if the debate goes on past 2.30pm. There is no time limit on members\u0027 speeches on a Friday, effectively allowing them to talk for as long as they want.  Their marathon speeches were during the first debate of the day, on a bill to tighten regulation on the use of force in Mental Health Units. Tory grandee Chope, 71, the MP for Christchurch in Dorset, shouted down the Voyeurism (Offences) Bill at the second reading stage in the Commons on Friday, prompting derision from his Conservative colleagues and campaigners alike. MPs cried shame as progress of the bill, which has cross-party support and is backed by the Government, was delayed until at July. Other bills that were blocked included a bill to ban buses and coaches from using tyres more than 10 years old a bill to extend Freedom of Information laws to contractors working on public projects and housing associations a bill to abolish hospital car parking charges a bill to ban unpaid workplace trial periods and a bill to tighten regulation on the use of force in Mental Care Units. Sir Christopher failed to respond to repeated attempts by the Press Association to comment. Theresa May has now moved to soothe anger at the actions of one of her party\u0027s longest-serving MPs.  The Prime Minister, who last month signalled her support for the campaign to ban people from taking pictures up someone\u0027s clothing without their consent, pledged the Government would back moves to get the anti-upskirting legislation through Parliament. The PM expressed her disappointment that the private member\u0027s Bill, which would have made upskirting a criminal offence in its own right, was delayed in the Commons. Mrs May said: Upskirting is an invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed. I am disappointed the Bill didn\u0027t make progress in the Commons today, and I want to see these measures pass through Parliament - with Government support - soon. The Government earlier said it had every expectation upskirting will become illegal, despite Sir Christopher\u0027s actions in opposing a law that would prohibit the craze. Former minister Sir Christopher was heckled with cries of shame! as he deployed his oft-used tactic of opposing backbench private members\u0027 bills by simply shouting an objection moments after the Bill was called.  But Justice Minister, Lucy Frazer said she was confident Sir Christopher\u0027s actions would not scupper the Bill in the long term, although the Ministry of Justice stopped short of setting a time frame on when it would become law. She said: We are committed to making sure upskirting becomes a criminal offence and have every expectation that this will happen. The Voyeurism (Offences) Bill had its second reading on Friday, which, after the Government announced its support following months of legal wrangling with campaigners, would have seen the worst offenders jailed for two years for taking an image under someone\u0027s clothing. Victims said a specific law prohibiting the craze was necessary as current legislation was often insufficient to prosecute an offender. Gina Martin, an upskirting victim whose petition to criminalise the act won her a legion of celebrity supporters and political backing, said the decision left her extremely upset but that she remained positive. David Gauke, the Justice Secretary who collaborated with Ms Martin over her campaign, echoed the dismay within the Conservatives. He said: The Government supported today\u0027s Bill on \u0027up-skirting\u0027. Disappointed that no progress today - the law needs to be reformed. But it will be. Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem MP who introduced the Bill after lobbying Sir Christopher on the back benches in the moments before he delivered the crushing blow, said she was angry, frustrated and disappointed. London mayor Sadiq Khan said he was dismayed and appalled at the action, while Tory MP Bob Neill said he has written to the Prime Minister asking that government time be made available to the allow the Voyeurism (Offences) Bill to have its second reading. Moments after blocking the upskirting Bill, Sir Christopher also opposed Finn\u0027s Law, Government-backed plans to give police dogs and horses extra legal protections from attack, and also talked out attempts to reform mental health units. The session caused such outrage it was trending on Twitter in the UK.

She voyaged to Ibiza and Cyprus and is off to Spain in September as she celebrates pals becoming brides. Becki has been to 20 weddings since 2016 and the cost is \u0026pound1,600 more than her own will be next year. She and her fianc\u0026eacute Craig Byam spent \u0026pound6,000 on hen and stag do’s, \u0026pound5,000 on accommodation, \u0026pound3,000 on travel, \u0026pound1,000 on gifts, \u0026pound800 on outfits and \u0026pound800 on drinks and extras. But marketing specialist Becki, 26, doesn’t regret a penny of it. She said: “I was shocked when I sat down and did the sums. Nearly \u0026pound17,000.  That’s enough for a new car plus a couple of luxury holidays.  “Some people will think that’s a crazy amount to spend on other \u0026shypeople’s weddings. “Not me – every penny has been well worth it. “I adore my friends and family and would spend whatever it took to share the most important day of their lives with them.”  The spending started in 2016 when Becki attended 12 weddings and seven hen parties. There were three in 2017 but a modest five this year. Becki and Craig, who works in construction, earn average salaries and used most of their spare cash to pay for the celebrations – \u0026shyspending way more than the average \u0026pound266 cost of attending a wedding. She said: “We’re lucky. We don’t have children. We’ve got our house. We both work full time. “We always found the money somehow. With a lot of these things you pay in advance, so our expenses were staggered. “We genuinely had no idea the final tally would be so much.  “The way I look at it is we got lots of fun nights out with the people we love and weekend getaways. “I don’t see why people get \u0026shynegative about the cost of attending weddings. It’s pure fun.” As well as the European trips Becki has visited north, south, east and west in the UK – from Edinburgh to Brighton and Norwich to Liverpool. There have been quaint countryside soirees and ultra-glam urban affairs. Becki went on: “One of the most fun weddings was a destination in Ibiza. It cost almost \u0026pound3,000 but I didn’t mind as we got a fantastic holiday.”  Two of the cheapest weddings cost only \u0026pound60 because they were down the road from where Becki lives with Craig, 31, in Ipswich. Her most expensive UK hen trip was to Brighton in 2016 – setting her back \u0026pound500. That’s the same figure she spent in total on six new dresses for that year’s weddings. And she admitted: “Of course, I like to have a nice outfit. Craig can get away with using the same suit and just mixing things up with a different shirt and tie.  “Now if any of my friends need a dress for a wedding, they head to my closet.” Before 2016, Becki had attended only nine weddings in her lifetime. With more pals tying the knot, Becki’s own big day will be the 33rd wedding ceremony she has attended – after 17 hen do’s. Going to so many has helped her map out her own big day within a \u0026pound15,000 budget.  She said: “We’ve been able to learn a lot from going to so many weddings. The No1 thing we’ve come away with is that money doesn’t \u0026shymatter. “We’ve had a fantastic time as guests. The most important thing is that you are \u0026shysurrounded by people you love. “I don’t think anyone should ever feel pressure to attend a hen do or wedding if they don’t have the cash. “I would understand if someone opted out for that reason. And if you can’t afford a gift, your \u0026shypresence will do just fine.” "},{"url":null,"title":"flesh eating salmonella thailand street","story":"NewsMayo on chips nearly killed young woman on romantic trip to ThailandSian Kempster, 29, from London, recalls how bacteria infected her digestive system and began eating through her intestines after \"boring\" snack on romantic trip\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRuby Deevoy19:48, 16 JUN 2018Updated20:00, 16 JUN 2018NewsSian Kempster went on a romantic Thai holiday with her boyfriend but one simple snack there nearly killed her\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI met my boyfriend Richard on a work night out in 2011 when we were both working as store managers.  He was 24, I was 21 and our relationship got off to a really fabulous start. After a couple of months, we decided to pack in our jobs and travel the world together. Our first destination was Bangkok and, excitedly, we headed out for a bite to eat. All the traditional Thai dishes smelled fantastic and looked wonderfully exotic. But I’d heard horror stories about food poisoning from street food, so I decided to stick to chips and mayonnaise.  Boring, admittedly, but I thought it best to play safe. I felt pretty grim the following morning but put it down to jet lag. Two days later, however, I was bedridden and really suffering. I was pale, sweating and having terrible tummy trouble. It was clear I had food poisoning.  At Richard’s insistence I saw a doctor and was sent away with antibiotics. The next day was my birthday. We had planned a great night out – a fantastic meal, with cocktails and dancing. But it was not to be. I took a turn for the worse and my stomach cramps became unbearable.  I went to the doctor again and was quickly admitted to hospital. It was a terrifying experience – being rushed around, with doctors asking me questions in Thai and broken English. The pain was getting worse by the second. Richard and I held each other, anxiously awaiting results of blood tests and scans. Then, suddenly and without warning, my belly was wiped down by nurses. I was being prepped for surgery – and panicked. Rich called his dad, a doctor in the UK, and he Skyped the Thai surgeon to find out what was going on. It took just a few moments for him to work out that I had contracted a rare strain of salmonella, sometimes found in mayonnaise, which had triggered ulcerative colitis.

According to single mum Krysta, 29, her 10-year-old daughter Shyyra would often come home and talk about Jessie, her favourite teacher, who she nicknamed Mr Thor because of his long blonde hair.  Over the space of a year, the two adults would speak intermittently when Krysta came to drop off and pick her daughter up, reports .

He was going to take Krysta on a romantic walk and have Shyyra surprise her with a ring - but when the time came, Shyyra got her own special surprise. The former teacher, who now works as a landscaping manager, got down on one knee and had prepared proposals for both of the ladies in his life.

Caffe Nero staff allegedly denied the request of blind man Olliver Gibbons, 40. He has claimed he told them his Golden Labrador Sydney had been guiding him around the seaside town.  The coffee chain says it is now investigating the incident at its Exmouth branch, Devon Live reports.   The chain said it was not company policy to refuse guide dogs water.   Olliver\u0027s friend Helen Fox, who helps him live independently, told the Exmouth Journal : I said, ‘he’s a guide dog’, but they just said ‘no’ and walked off.  “It was really hot, he had been working and we had just taken him off the harness for a free run.  “I was taken aback – any dog should be allowed a drink, but he is also a working dog. “Ollie doesn’t want to go back again. It made him quite sad, really. He was asking why they were being like that.” Sydney eventually got a drink at Tempus the Jeweller in Albion Street. Guide Dogs South West spokesman Clive Wood said: “It’s very disappointing that the staff in this Caffe Nero made a decision to deny providing water to this gentleman’s guide dog on such a warm day. It’s disappointing that the level of customer service fell lower than expected from a national chain.” An RSPCA spokesperson said: “It’s extremely concerning to hear that a coffee shop refused to provide drinking water for a service dog whose handler was a customer. We would expect all businesses to show kindness and compassion towards all animals, but particularly to service dogs.

A 15-point plan written by wife Angie has guided him since she died in 2010. He has carefully plaited hair, ironed shirts, made sure the kids are in before dark – and vetted boyfriends and girlfriends. Proud Ian is now using the same rules to raise a new generation – his five grandchildren. His loving and caring offspring have done him and Angie proud. And, fittingly, the clan will gather round him today to say a special thank you on Father’s Day.  Former miner Ian, 56, lost childhood sweetheart Angie to cancer. Days before she died at 48, she compiled a list of parenting essentials for Ian and the instructions – shown right – inspired the bestselling book called Mum’s Way. Today Ian and the family will walk along the Yorkshire coast, with Angie in their thoughts. He said: “We’re going to do our annual walk across Thornwick Bay at Flamborough Head, where we’ll pay a visit to Angie’s bench, lay flowers and share memories. “We used to lay in that spot as teenagers looking over the bay, so it’s a perfect way to keep her involved. When we used to do the walk with Angie, she’d cook a medium rare steak back at home, with chips, onion rings, mushrooms and a sliced tomato. “This year I’ll order that from a pub, where I’ll unwrap presents from the kids. My older sons get me Joop or Hugo Boss aftershave as a nod to Angie, as she’d always got me that from them.  “Ella usually gets me chocolates in spite of rule 14 – ‘Don’t give them too many sweets’. She’s found a loophole!” Ian and Angie married in 1985 after falling in love at 14 when they met in the park in Grimethorpe, South Yorks. They had three sons – Ryan, 32, Damon, 29, and Reece, 27 – before Angie was diagnosed with breast cancer at 29. Five years later, after the all-clear, they went on to have five more kids – Connor, 19, twins Jake and Jade, 15, Corey, 12, and Ella, 10. But in 2008, non-smoker Angie developed a persistent cough and doctors found incurable cancer in her lung. It prompted her to write the tear-stained set of rules which Ian swears by. The pointers also cover bedtime rituals, how much screen time the kids get, and a reminder to use sunblock. Now mum’s pearls of wisdom are being passed on to Ian’s grandkids – Ryan’s son Issak, seven, Damon’s two sons Warren, 11, and Cohen, 17 weeks, and Reece’s son Jaxon, three, and daughter Willow, one.  And Ian says he is just as strict with the grandkids. They get just one hour computer time and are indoors before dark to enjoy dinner together. And Ian brings out Angie’s note when necessary to remind his brood about what Mum would have wanted. Another rule – number 16 – was scribbled out and, on reflection, Ian believes it was a reminder from Angie to look after himself. He goes on: “I miss Angie every day but I really did feel her absence during the birth of our grandchildren. She’d have loved hugging them, just as I do.” His hard work enforcing Angie’s list really has seen the kids flourish. Ella was just three when her mum died, but is set to leave primary school with a 100 per cent attendance record. Ian \u0026shyrecalled her first nativity play and said it was particularly difficult.  He said: “As I sat down a \u0026shyteacher said ‘Mr Millthorpe, you are in for a real treat’. Then Ella sang a solo number. I could see the parents turning to look at me. I was almost in tears and I kept looking up wishing Angie could see her too.” Twins Jake and Jade, 15, are studying for their GCSEs, Corey, 12, is doing well at secondary school and Ella, now 10, will join him in September. Connor is learning joinery and plastering at \u0026shycollege. Eldest son Ryan, a warehouse worker, is a few streets away while brickie Damon and window fitter Reece live on the same road as Ian. But the hands-on dad has his own health battles. Having survived a brain haemorrhage in 2004, Ian has chronic lung disease and has trouble breathing after over 20 years as a miner. He said: “The hardest thing I’ve had to deal with is my health. I just want to do right by Angie and my kids. I don’t want to become a burden.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle isnt only member","story":"NewsMeghan Markle isn\u0027t only member of Royal Family to have flaunted sex appeal in racy photographsFrom Princess Margaret to Grace Kelly - and even Prince Harry himself - the Windsors have always stripped off and got raunchy without a second thought\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAntonia Paget21:03, 16 JUN 2018NewsWhile the Duchess of Sussex got raunchy for a Men\u0027s Health clip, she is not the only royal to have shown off her sex appeal (Image: Mens Health)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSexy pictures of Meghan Markle this week caused a stir, leading her to be called the raciest royal yet. But the new Duchess of Sussex is one in a long line of royals who have set pulses racing. The saucy stills were taken from a video filmed in 2013 by US Men’s Health magazine, which referred to Meghan as “the ultimate guys’ girl”. Footage of the then-actress shows her barbecuing a burger and seductively licking sauce off her thumb as she dis-plays her abs in a crop top. The shoot, filmed while she was starring in US legal drama Suits, was captioned “Grilling Never Looked So Hot”.  Meghan is no stranger to the camera after a decade working in the acting industry, and it resulted in many a sexy shoot to promote her work. But despite being the first Hollywood actress to marry into the British royal family, the new Duchess is not the first member of the firm to show her sexier side when not on duty. Of course, things have got racier over the years. Queen Elizabeth’s sister Princess Margaret first sparked a scandal when in 1959 her birthday portrait showed her bare-shouldered. But as time went on, the idea of a royal not always being clothed from head to toe became more acceptable.  Her daughter Zara is a prime example of rocking a sexy look. Many royals have been photographed on the beach – including Princess Diana in an orange two-piece swimsuit while on holiday in 1999. And Prince Harry, 33, who Meghan, 36, married at Windsor Castle last month, was also snapped topless during a break while serving in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan.  The pictures, taken in 2008, showed him playing rugby with his colleagues during his 10-week tour guiding fighter jets towards suspected Taliban targets. And although fully clothed, the Duke of Cambridge, 35, also oozed sex appeal when he was candidly snapped in his air force uniform during a visit to RAF Valley on Anglesey, Wales, seven years ago.  Topless photos of his wife Kate, 36, were published in a French magazine without permission in 2012. Lawyers have since filed an appeal claiming that William and Kate should not have received a \u0026pound92,000 privacy payout. These days mum-of-three Kate looks very demure but often shows off her playful side – as do Prince Andrew’s daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.  Actress Grace Kelly was a sex symbol in 1950s America, appearing in films such as High Society and alongside Cary Grant in To Catch a Thief before she became Princess of Monaco after marrying Prince Rainier III in 1956. Many photos of her posing in swimsuits or risqu\u0026eacute outfits only added to her pin-up status, and after her marriage, no effort was made to ignore her acting past and standing as a sex symbol.

People in Cherhill Close, Clifton, put up the impressive display of England flags and now they believe the sight is unrivalled across the country. Chief organiser Ryan Beales decided to decorate the neighbourhood for the first time - and the results are astounding.  He decided to do it ahead of England v Tunisia, which airs on BBC One on Monday at 7pm.   He told the Nottingham Post : When you drive around no one has got any up, it\u0027s done my head in.  Last Euros everyone did it but now it seems everyone\u0027s scared to put a flag up, so we\u0027ve really gone for it.

Everyone was helping, says Forest fan Ryan, They were all getting up ladders and that. We started at 2pm and didn\u0027t finish until 7pm. Ryan, who lives in the close, told the Post of his difficulty in finding the World Cup decorations. I went everywhere and I couldn\u0027t find any, he says. But luckily a trading contact knew where to get some. Ryan also picked up 20 flags from Collins Cash and Carry in Aspley. On Monday, the football fan says he\u0027ll be watching England\u0027s first World Cup match with his family and kids at home - and while he has his fingers crossed Ryan is keeping a sense of humour about the tournament.

Several fans were disappointed and frustrated to be told the tickets they had bought for the Rolling Stones concert in Cardiff from Viagogo were not actually valid.  James Lye bought two top-tier tickets from the website in February for \u0026pound366 - even though they were originally bought for \u0026pound99.95.  But although he got suspicious when the tickets were sent from Italy, he was looking forward to seeing the band play. Then, on Friday, when he got to the front of the queue, he was horrified to be told the tickets had been cancelled. The 39-year-old said they went to the ticket office, where they were able to buy two more tickets for \u0026pound68 each.  So we still got in, but we spent more than \u0026pound500 on tickets and we were on the top tier, on the back corner, he told Wales Online . I should have done my homework. I was in a rush and bought them from my phone.   Mr Lye, from near Bath, said he emailed Viagogo twice, tweeted and contacted them on Facebook but has had no reply as yet. I feel poorer and pretty gutted, he continued. When we got to the front of the queue, we thought it was sold out so it was quite upsetting. We were a bit disappointed. Mr Lye added: The concert was fantastic and I couldn\u0027t believe how much energy Mick Jagger has got. I wouldn\u0027t have chosen to spend \u0026pound500 on tickets, but still was a brilliant gig. I just don\u0027t want other people to make the same mistake I did. Lowri Jones was another person who said she had problems with the tickets she bought from Viagogo. She said she bought two tickets in March as a present for her sister and her mum, Dot Jones. She said it was a bit of a panic buy as she wanted to get them as a present for her mum\u0027s 70th birthday and paid around \u0026pound315 for both of them. She didn\u0027t even know whether they were sitting or standing tickets.  Initially she was told she would need to print the tickets, she said, but about a week ago they contacted her saying they would be posted to her. They asked for an address and said the tickets would need to be signed for, Ms Jones continued. She said she repeatedly tried to contact them asking when the tickets would be delivered, but they didn\u0027t email her back until Thursday, the day before the concert. She said: It was really frustrating. On Thursday at 4.30pm somebody rang me to say I had not given them an address. I said that I had.  I asked whether it would be better for us to pick them up in Cardiff and they said they would send me an email saying where and when to pick them up. They said 3pm in the Marriott hotel. They [her mum and her sister] went to get their tickets to be told there were no tickets there and that they would refund them the money. It was a real disaster.

Warning signs have also been posted around the building telling travellers: Please do not lay down on the seats. The Essex airport brought in the new policy amid claims that hundreds of passengers were camping out overnight - some of them on hammocks or blow-up beds.  But it isn\u0027t going down well with passengers, who say the move is unfair and mean to tired travellers. Under the lock-out policy, which began on Monday, the departures wing is closed after the final flight of the night. It remains shut from midnight until 2am, meaning anyone arriving at the budget flight airport during that time is directed to the arrivals area. They can take a seat and rest there, but they are banned from having a nap on the floor.  Guards are on patrol to wake up those who are fast asleep. Passengers who book early morning flights have been told not to arrive sooner than their scheduled check-in time. Stansted said it has seen up to 600 people camp out in the terminal overnight. Some travellers would rather sleep on the terminal floor instead of a local hotel, where rooms can cost upwards of \u0026pound140 a night. They can hamper overnight work or get in the way of passengers arriving later in the morning.

Jordan Mcilquham found what is thought to be an accidentally leaked coin in her change after a quick shop in town. The coins are not officially launched until Monday and Jordan said she was surprised when she came across the money.  Details of the new coins had not then been released by the Royal Mint , which is based 10 miles from her hometown of Caerphilly in Llantrisant, Wales.  It is believed to have been accidentally pocketed by someone at the Mint, before being spent at a nearby shop.

Jordan, 19, told Wales Online : I was just out shopping in Caerphilly, I came home and checked my bag to make sure my card was still there and I saw a lovely coin.  I Googled it to see if it was worth anything but there was nothing about the coin anywhere so I went on Facebook and contacted a group - it was something like UK Coin Collecters.  I spoke to them and said I had this coin and they told me about it. I couldn\u0027t believe it. When they are officially launched, the coins will feature the travelling bear in two of his most famous locations, Paddington Station and Buckingham Palace. Launched to celebrate the 60th anniversary of his first adventure in A Bear Called Paddington, the coins will be released on Monday, in both silver and colour. The Royal Mint says the coins won\u0027t be released into circulation, and to get your hands on one will cost \u0026pound10. You can buy them direct from the Mint. Jordan added: I\u0027m not a coin collector so it was a bit of a surprise. I have been contacted by the Royal Mint.

Now his mother , Jemma Smedley says she believes her son\u0027s innocence has been lost.  The incident happened at around 6pm in Derby when he was playing on his bike in a park with friends.  Jemma told the Derby  : He told me that he was speeding along on his bike. After coming from the park, he pulled out in front of his friends.  “A white van pulled up and there were two men inside. One man who looked in his 40s and a younger man in his 20s in the passenger seat. “Alfie said the man on the passenger side shouted at him and said: \u0027Get in the van now\u0027, and Alfie just shouted back: \u0027No\u0027 and rode off.  “He said he was really worried because the van went past him and indicated to pull over. At that point, his friends were catching up to him and the van sped off. She said that she was “one foot out of the door” when she had heard what happened and ran to Cotmanhay Park. She was greeted by numerous police cars and riot vans. Officers were speaking to children to get as much information as possible. Jemma added: “Normally Alfie is such a sweet and calm boy who is a bit feisty sometimes but when I saw him, he was in bits. “He just couldn’t stop sobbing and, throughout most of the night, he was asking me ‘What did they want me for?’ and as a parent, you shouldn’t need to explain why or what they wanted him for. “This all took place on my front door step. Unfortunately, it happened to my son but there were so many other children at the park, it could have happened to any of them. “Any other child and their parent could be in the same position as I am right now telling you this story. All I hope is that parents are aware what has happened. “It’s tough as well because you want to wrap them up and keep them safe but, as a parent, you know you can’t do that”.

Rebecca Carey, nine, and her twin sister Lottie have become stars of this year’s Marks \u0026amp Spencer catalogue back-to-school range. And Rebecca also dances in a new BBC Super Movers campaign to encourage children to become more active. Her proud mum Pam, 48, says: “After everything we have been through, to see Rebecca doing all this is just incredible. “We couldn’t be happier. We’ll never be able to thank everyone who helped her enough.”  Two years ago, we revealed how Rebecca yearned to walk just like twin Lottie. But she was denied surgery on the NHS that could help her get out of her wheelchair.  So the sisters wrote to then Prime Minister David Cameron to ask why she could not be treated for her stage-four cerebral palsy .  “Why won’t you let me walk and play with my twin sister? It makes me sad. In my dreams I can walk and play,” she told the PM. And Lottie added: “Can you tell me why you won’t pay for my sister to have an operation to help her walk?” But the NHS couldn’t help, so her mum and dad Tim, 50, began raising funds themselves for life-changing surgery in America. Generous Sunday Mirror readers dug deep, helping to raise tens of thousands of pounds towards the \u0026pound84,000 selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery in Missouri. Stoke City player Peter Crouch also hosted an event for the young fan, netting \u0026pound26,000 for the fund.  After the op to destroy problematic nerve roots in the spinal cord, which hamper people with such conditions, Rebecca had intense physiotherapy – finally building enough strength to use her walking aid on her own.  By December last year she could sit unaided , use her left arm and could even speak more easily.  “At Christmas she was able to walk to the tree to pick up her presents,” says Pam, of Congleton, Cheshire. Then came stardom. M\u0026ampS – whose local branch had supported \u0026shyRebecca’s fundraising – asked if she and Lottie could model for the 2018 uniform range. They were photographed in April, and now also proudly feature on the M\u0026ampS website.  “It was a lovely thing for M\u0026ampS to do. When Rebecca saw her picture online she was quite bemused,” says Pam. “It is quite ironic that we are working incredibly hard to encourage Rebecca to walk independently but she is photographed in her wheelchair. “She has come on in leaps and bounds.” Ryan Becker, head of kidswear marketing at M\u0026ampS said: “We had a great time shooting our Back to School campaign with 30 brilliant kids and both Rebecca and Lottie were a pleasure to work with. “This year the theme of our adverts both online and in-store is “life isn’t uniform” so it was \u0026shyespecially important to have a diverse range of models wearing our clothes.”  The BBC also offered Rebecca a starring role in their new campaign to get kids active, run in partnership with the Premier League. Dan Gooding, executive producer at BBC Learning, says: “It was important to us to show that Super Movers, an initiative to get children moving more at school and at home, is accessible and enjoyable for everyone – regardless of age, background or ability. “Rebecca showed us she is an \u0026shyabsolute star and a real champion of the Super Movers spirit”. The youngster continues to go from strength to strength thanks to her op. “From always having to be by an adult’s side since the day she was born, she is now revelling in her new found \u0026shyindependence – and being able to play with her sister.

Wa Tiba\u0027s children became concerned when she failed to return to her home in Southeast Sulawesi Thursday, June 14. A search party was launched the next morning in a desperate bid to find the 54-year-old - and her sandals, machete and torch were later found 30 metres from a patch of bushes. Nothing could have prepared Wa Tiba\u0027s sons for what happened next. The pair discovered an enormous python on the ground, barely able to move due to an enormous bulge in its belly after it had swallowed the housewife head first.  Resident Ayu Kartika said: Everybody was crying, everybody was shocked. The poor woman. This is like a horror movie. People are terrified. We are scared to go outside. We can only pray for a safety. The frantic lads called police and by 9am hundreds of villagers had gathered round the patch of grass in the remote Mabolu Village in the Lohia Regency of Muna province.  Nightmarish footage captured the moment the snake\u0027s skin was sliced open to reveal the slime-covered corpse of the housewife. She was still wearing her brown leggings and dark red top.  While the knife that Wa Tiba had gone out with the previous evening was found on the floor - suggesting she had dropped it after being struck with deadly power by the killer python. Her head was towards the snake\u0027s tail and her feet at its mouth - showing that she had been swallowed head first.  Police superintendent Agung Ramos from the Muna district Indonesian National Police said Wa Tiba had went out to check her garden the previous evening and never returned. He said: Children and residents had been looking for Wa after she did not return home. Some items belonging to victim, sandals, machete, and flashlights, were found but the victim was not there. The family then reported this to the police and the search reached its conclusion at 9am. Residents found a python that looked like it was unable to move. Residents then suspected the snake swallowed Wa Tiba.  People took the snake into the village and started splitting the snake. The suspicions were true and there was a body in tact inside the snake. Unfortunately the victim was lifeless. Wa Tiba had a traditional burial ceremony later that afternoon in keeping with traditional religious customs.  Sulawesi is an island in Indonesia that is home to some of the biggest and most deadly wild pythons in the world. In March last year, a young farmer was found dead having also been swallowed by an enormous killer snake.  Footage showed him being cut from the python\u0027s stomach after going missing the night before while harvesting on a rubber plantation.

We’ve got one retiring at Baldragon and we’ve filled that.“You’d think that they (Labour) would know that, considering that elected members sit on the panel to determine head teachers. It’s fair to say the position is getting better compared to a few years ago.“The posts that are unfilled at the moment will be filled. It’s not a case where we’ll just not replace anyone.“We’ve got applicants and candidates for every position. That’s not to say that they are all necessarily the right candidates and we still have to go through the interview process along with all the correct checks to prove that they are suitable.”Mr Malone believes vacant posts are having an adverse impact on closing the attainment gap in Dundee and called on the administration to “up its game” or risk “complete failure”.He added: “If we are to meet targets for enhancing the learning experience and closing the attainment gap, then we need to ensure our schools have the resources necessary for every child to get the educational opportunities they deserve.“Also, that our teachers can receive the support necessary to continue their efforts to deliver high-quality teaching without any undue stress due to staffing shortages.“Tighter financial controls would have allowed the council to free up money to deliver an incentive to attract the subject teachers.“The administration rejected Labour’s proposals at budget time that would have delivered a golden hello to the subject teachers we need to attract.“More financial control by the administration could have delivered so much more and resolved the problem we currently have in attracting teachers.”But Councillor Murray said Labour’s alternative was unviable, adding: “Other councils have done that but that’s not the route I want to go down.“It doesn’t work. It becomes an arms race where one authority can offer more than the other.“It doesn’t create any more staff and it’s just a waste of public money.“I’ve only been in the position for 12 months and it’s definitely been a lot easier this year finding staff.“I think a lot of it is down to there being more confidence in the city.“We’re doing a lot of work with Dundee University for people who can’t afford to quit their jobs to apply for teaching vacancies in city schools and that’s been positive.“There’s certainly no shortage of people applying.“We’ve been inundated particularly with people wanting to become head teachers, which is a good thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b238ed81901b-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee va could host weddings as approval given to sell booze","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe V\u0026ampA Dundee museum could host events as varied as weddings and casino nights, its operators have revealed.The details emerged during a meeting of the council’s licensing board, during which the gallery made its case to sell booze for consumption both on and off the premises.The museum’s operation plan, distributed ahead of the meeting, revealed V\u0026ampA bosses hope to stage live music, dance performances, film screenings, private events and casino nights.Janet Hood, representing the V\u0026ampA at the board meeting, said this could even stretch to include weddings.She said: “As I am sure you are all aware, there is a cafe in the foyer.

Kettlewell and Steven Ferguson are determined to make their first chance in management a success.County will be a tough nut to crack for most teams in the Championship.Inverness CTCaley Thistle were expected to be Dundee United’s main challengers last season but got off to an awful start.Boss John Robertson turned things around and a late surge almost saw them into the play-offs.Expect that good form to continue in the new campaign.DunfermlineAllan Johnston’s 2017/18 team has been ripped apart with players leaving left, right and centre.With a lot of work to be done in the transfer market at the moment, another finish in the play-offs looks unlikely but Johnston has a history of getting his sides into the top four.FalkirkFormer Dundee manager Paul Hartley is slowly making the Bairns side

haven’t done much business this summer, the arrival of Gary Harkins apart, and will have to tighten up their defence if they are to cause any trouble at the top end of the division in the new

yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years. That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Sunday 17 Jun 2018 5:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111979.jpg","title":"Flying the flag for equality for women","story":"\u0026nbspAN eye-catching banner made by a group of women in Inverness will take centre stage in a mass procession this weekend to celebrate the centenary of British women being given the right to vote.Members of Highland Multicultural Friends joined forces with a Merkinch craft group to create the artwork which will be carried through the streets of Edinburgh.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe parade, which takes place on Sunday, coincides with others in London, Cardiff and Belfast involving tens of thousands of women.\u0026nbspThe Inverness banner is one of just 100 which have been specially commissioned by 14-18 Now, the UK\u0027 arts programme for the World War I centenary, in conjunction with public art producer, Artichoke.It is intended to echo the suffrage movement, voicing women\u0027 contemporary hopes and concerns.The two groups involved in its creation were Common Threads \u0026ndash part of Highland Multicultural Friends \u0026ndash and Blazing Needles of Merkinch.Common Threads\u0026nbspis an informal friendship and support group for women from different cultural backgrounds who share a common interest in handiwork ranging from embroidery and patchwork to knitting and crochet.It meets weekly at the Cameron Youth Centre in Planefield Road.Blazing Needles, formed under the now defunct\u0026nbsp Arts in Merkinch organisation, meets weekly at the Bike Shed in Grant Street.Project co-ordinator Catherine MacNeil said the women were delighted with the completed artwork which was created with the help of a professional artist.\"They wanted to make it clear that they were women from the Highlands,\" she said.\"They also wanted it to show that while this is a celebration of women getting the vote there is still a long way to go.\"Words such as equality, diversity and compassion feature on the banner.\"These are things which they feel we are still working towards \u0026ndash and not just for women,\" she said.The project brought together a broad range of women,\u0026nbsp some of whom came to the Highlands from countries where equality is still a dream rather than a reality.\"Every woman is different,\" Ms MacNeil said.\"They all brought something different to the project.\"They all had their own perspective which added to the dialogue because of their own life experiences.\"She also felt it had enabled new links and friendships to be formed.\"I think the main thing they enjoyed was that it was a collaboration,\" she said.\"It was not just one group which meets regularly \u0026ndash it was two groups coming together.\"They enjoyed meeting new people from the other group.\"They also enjoyed the opportunity to work with a professional artist who helped them to develop new ideas.

bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as

People want it open more often and to accommodate all age groups. It could be based on water fountains/jets, as in an installation in Southend which includes colour changing lighting.Another option is to create a three-storey adjacent lido with open-air pool on the top floor and spa facilities on the first floor.A further option is to take over the nearby council-owned Nairn Leisure Centre pool, give it a glass roof and create a training and competition facility to complement a lido.The lido proposal was inspired by Bath\u0027 dramatic Thermae Spa.Lessees of the neighbouring links tearoom and James\u0026rsquo Caf\u0026eacute have put forward proposals to improve their facilities.Community leaders are excited but have urged sensitive handling of the initiative.Nairn River Community Council chairman Tommy Hogg said: \"That area is part of Nairn\u0027 heritage so they\u0026rsquove got to do it sympathetically or it\u0026rsquoll cause massive problems.\"A council consultation keen to include input from local schools and youth groups is expected to follow in August.Planning officers say \"the time is ripe for a development plan\".Their report suggests building on a trail around Nairn from the Links through Viewfield and along the riverside featuring various attractions for \"people to linger, to learn about Nairn, to take part in an activity and to enjoy their surroundings\".Each point would incorporate a theme and\u0026nbspa dolphin-inspired artwork has been mooted.A draft plan is currently evolving for Nairn\u0027 77-pontoon harbour and waterfront to improve the harbour basin, surrounding buildings and maximise its potential to boost Nairn\u0027 economy.Planned projects include expansion of the pontoon system, increasing capacity to 97 boats and to develop a watersports centre.Other than driving to the links, people generally walk there as there is no public transport to the beach area.The planners say \"there may be an opportunity to operate a land train type tourist train in the summer months, taking people round the links, the harbour, Viewfield and Fishertown.\"Alternatively, there may be potential to develop a miniature railway, of the type used at Whin Park in Inverness.\"Sunday 17 Jun 2018 5:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114012.jpg","title":"The street has no name six years on","story":"\u0026nbspTHE hunt is on for a name for an Inverness street \u0026ndash after a six-year wait.The road that runs through Milton of Leys has never been named.Highland Council said it was agreed as far back as 2012 that naming the street \"would not be beneficial as it was not providing access to a particular address\".But the council has changed tack after a complaint from the ward\u0027\u0026nbspNon-Aligned Highland councillor Ken Gowans.He said residents were experiencing difficulties directing delivery drivers and added: \"If you had a bad accident on that road how would you identify your position? \"That road is a main thoroughfare that goes right the way down Milton of Leys.

It just shows the fine margins in football.“Switzerland are a very good side but over in Basel in the second leg (0-0) I thought we were far better.“We created the better chances and on another time it could have been our night.“Looking back we probably shot ourselves in the foot as we were maybe a bit more cautious at home than we usually are.”With no World Cup action McGinn has opted to return to Pittodrie a week earlier than the rest of the squad to ensure he can make an immediate impact in the new campaign.Aberdeen enter the Europa League at the second qualifying round on July 26 and discover their opponents in Wednesday’s draw.McGinn said: “I had a frustrating end to the last campaign picking up a few niggly injuries but I’ve had a good break now which has been really beneficial.“We come back near the end of June but I’m going in around a week prior to that to give myself time with the physios before I go back into full training.“I want to get myself ready to go and am determined to do well for the team.“I’m really excited about the season as we have European football and I really look forward to those games at the start of the campaign.“Hopefully we can do well in the Europa League then make a strong start domestically, which can build belief we can have another good season.”This summer though McGinn and his Northern Ireland team-mates will be left considering what could have been after the disappointment of the play-off loss to the Swiss.In the first leg at Windsor Park last November Ricardo Rodriguez scored the only goal of the play-off from the spot after Corry Evans was adjudged to have handled.The ball clearly struck the defender’s shoulder.It prevented Northern Ireland a second straight finals appearance having advanced to the Euro 2016 knock-out phase in the nation’s first appearance at a major finals since World Cup 1986.“Having experienced the Euros and all that followed from that tournament it is very frustrating not to be at the World Cup,” said McGinn.“It was an unbelievable experience and I saw just how much it meant to the people of Northern Ireland and that group of players.“To go to another tournament would have been incredible, especially the World Cup.”Following the World Cup play-offs the SFA made a botched attempt to secure Northern Ireland boss O’Neill as replacement for Gordon Strachan whose contract was not renewed.O’Neill rejected the SFA’s advances and opted to sign a new contract until 2024.“It is one of those ones where we didn’t qualify so we just have to keep moving forward,” said McGinn.“We are happy the manager has stayed and things are very positive in Northern Ireland at the moment.”The play-off disappointment had added poignancy for McGinn as he watched it from the other side of the world in South Korea having moved to Gwangju after rejecting a new deal at Pittodrie at the end of the 2016-17 season.The switch to the K League did not work out as he dropped out of the international reckoning and struggled to get regular game time at Gwangju.He said: “I was left out of the squad for the play-offs which was disappointing as I am an experienced player.“I wasn’t playing much club football at the time so I couldn’t really have an answer to that.“However, I have shown in the past that even when I have been on the bench and called upon I have always done a good job.“I came on and scored in the Euros and played my part in that campaign as well.“Being an experienced player it was disappointing I wasn’t involved.”Following Gwangju’s relegation and change of manager McGinn’s contract was terminated by mutual consent, opening the way to a Pittodrie return where he penned a three-and-a-half year deal in January.It propelled McGinn back into the international reckoning as he was selected for the squad to face South Korea in March but had to pull out through injury.He also missed out on the end-of-season friendlies away to Panama (0-0) and Costa Rica (3-0 loss) with a groin injury that ruled him out of the final games of the domestic season.He sat out the 1-0 win against Celtic at Parkhead.McGinn said: “The lads went into that game knowing if Rangers won at Hibs and we lost, Rangers would finish second – so to achieve what we did was fantastic.“To finish above Rangers was huge considering the financial side of things and the difference in that aspect between the two clubs.“I’m not sure we were recognised as much as we should have been for that.“It was probably our best achievement in the league under Derek McInnes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/5b1f62abe061e-436x564.jpg ","title":"a bit of hollywood comes to north east","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn iconic

Labour and Independent administration pledged to push for the investment in its budget speech in March.This would follow on from the first £250 million city region deal, signed in January 2017 to support the economic growth of the region.The government says it wants to see “clear evidence of positive delivery” before discussing any future arrangements.Ms Laing said: “Aberdeen is currently undergoing the biggest regeneration programme in 40 years.“This massive programme of regeneration has brought economic and social benefits\u0026#8230 and has reaffirmed Aberdeen’s position as

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"council perform u turn over","story":"NewsCouncil perform U-turn over car park feesThe astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:41, 13 JUN 2018NewsSouth Beach car park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParking charges WON’T be introduced at two Troon car parks, we can reveal. The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness.

Mhari said: “We had the perfect day with amazing weather and a beautiful sunset.  “All our closest friends and family joined us for a simple but loving ceremony carried out by Peter Clark of the Scottish Humanist Society.” The bride wore a Mori lee dress from Bijoux Bridal, Hamilton. Mhari’s veil held a special sentimental value to it.

The couple’s wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Sara Bryce (bride’s sister) and Lyndsey Bickerton and best men Grant Russell and Mark Rowe (groom’s brother).

Mhari added: “Both Barrie and Jim were fantastic all day, with us and all the guests. “The pictures are just too hard to pick from.” Stems and Gems in Saltcoats created the bouquets, buttonholes and flowers for the centrepieces while the cake was made by a relative.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000. She also set up the Glynhill Ladies Curling International event, which attracts world-class teams. Kirsty added: “I don’t know where I would be without curling. It has been a huge part of my life for 40 years. “Last week Ayr Curling Club got the active schools gold award for South Ayrshire and it is things like that which keep me going.” Ayrshire’s Lord-Lieutenant Iona McDonald congratulated the pair. She said: “They have made a considerable contribution to our communities and I am sure that this award comes as a great surprise, as many of them do not seek any recognition for the work that they do. •The Edinburgh-based business grandee Sir Brian Gammell Ivory, gets a CBE for his chairmanship role at Dumfries House.

Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost.

A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Lowood Bridge closure  SBC release update","story":"GOOD news for motorists - council bosses have confirmed that works to Lowood Bridge are set to be complete in time for Melrose Festival Week.\nThe project is in its final stages and remains on schedule to be completed by Monday, June 18, the day of the Melrosian Rideout.\nSo far, the temporary scaffolding has been removed, which means works on the bridge deck area can start.\nRepairs to the bridge\u0027s stonework are now complete, as well as resurfacing of the Waverley Road/Lowood Road junction.

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

They are one of four one-act plays that will take part in the Scottish Community Drama\u0026rsquos National Youth Drama final in Plockton on Saturday.  The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment. In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7413625.jpg?htype=1856\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Plans for 1 500 homes and new school on edge of Musselburgh","story":"              A PLANNING application has been lodged for 1,500 new houses, a primary school and employment land at Craighall, by Musselburgh.  Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7868119.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"12 new rules the council is making over selfish parking in Musselburgh","story":"              A RAFT of traffic restrictions are to be introduced in Musselburgh to control inconsiderate parking.

Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents.

Focusing on the interesting, the unusual and the under-appreciated, readers will discover curiosities that have spent years hiding in plain sight and delight as local treasures are given their due in front of a worldwide audience.  Among the 111 places are a selection of fascinating trees, statues of Victorian politicians, churches, buildings converted into music venues, restaurants - and even an indoor mountaineering centre.  There are also must-see shipyards, iconic pubs, patisserie, square sausage, stunning visual art in galleries and on gable walls.  Tom described how he has always wanted to \u0026ldquowrite a tome about my home city and \u0026ldquocouldn\u0026rsquot refuse the offer when he was commissioned to write it.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe remit was to remember that 111 places is more than a guide book, and I was free to write in my peculiar style developed over 25 years in charge of the Herald Diary column.  \u0026ldquoThe result is a personal look at Glasgow in the 21st century, often through a rear view mirror.  \u0026ldquoThe publishers describe it as a wealth of local knowledge and engaging anecdotes which will guide the reader round a huge variety of intriguing sights, unique venues and surprising corners of this great city. Who am I to argue with that?  He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos certainly a handsome-looking book, richly illustrated by photographer Gillian Tait.

Painted on a 60ft by 40ft wall overlooking the city\u0027s Clutha bar, it features a portrait of Mackintosh looking through a stained-glass window.  The street art was commissioned by Radisson RED and designed and created by Art Pistol Projects and well-known Glasgow street artist Rogue-one as a gift to the city.  As part of the project, Radisson RED has donated \u0026pound1,000 to The Clutha Trust, the charity set up after 10 people died when a police helicopter crashed onto the roof of the pub in November 2013.  Michael Weston, curator at Radisson RED hotel in Glasgow, said: \"After opening our doors in April, we wanted to give something that showed our commitment to the local art scene as well as the city of Glasgow itself.  \"It was important to us that the mural represented a key piece of Glasgow\u0027s history, so commissioning a mural of one of the city\u0027s most iconic artists, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was perfect.  \"It is a fitting tribute to one of Glasgow\u0027s greatest talents in his 150th anniversary year - and I\u0027d encourage everyone to come see it.\"  Born on June 7 1868, Mackintosh trained as an architect and went on to create much-admired buildings including the Glasgow School of Art and Scotland Street School in Glasgow.  The mural was given the go-ahead following a planning row after an objection from a neighbouring business.  Alan Crossan, owner of the Clutha bar, said: \"This mural is a fantastic piece of artwork and a fantastic donation to the Clutha Trust.\"  Bobby McNamara, known as Rogue-one, is renowned for his photo-realistic style and is behind a number of artworks in Glasgow, including Mitchell Street\u0027s floating taxi.  Mr McNamara said: \"From the original design sketch to the completion of the mural, it\u0027s been hard work but of course great fun.  \"Using scaffolding to access the wall was awkward at times as it\u0027s hard to see what you\u0027re doing, but I pushed on utilising my skills and experience. In the end I think I achieved something special.\"  Ali Smith, founder of Art Pistol Projects, said: \"Mackintosh is a bit of a global superstar so we had to get this one right.  \"Stepping away from the wall now it really feels like a special one, a just portrayal of such an iconic and well-loved figure.  \"Everyone that\u0027s been involved deserves a big thanks.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Ian McConnell  Britain seems like such a funny little country when the Brexiters bluster","story":"              BRITAIN sometimes seems like a funny little country these days.  True, it still ranks as one of the world\u0026rsquos big economies. But Chancellor Philip Hammond conceded in November that it had fallen from fifth to sixth-biggest, having been overtaken by France. And the UK\u0026rsquos own woeful performance and policy errors, and the rise of other countries, such as India, look set to ensure the drift down the rankings continues.  It is important to recognise that a country\u0026rsquos standing on the international stage is about much more than just size. It is also about influence, and attitude, and behaviour. Unfortunately for the UK, there is surely no arguing with the assertion that, in the strange days since the Brexit vote, the description of \u0026ldquofunny little could be applied to the mindset of so many Brexiters when it comes to the wider world.  It has been another most curious, though unfortunately no less lamentable, week on the Brexit front.  Read More: Ian McConnell: Taiwan strives for regional cooperation as UK turns back on partners with Brexit  We have had blustering Tory Brexiters in the House of Commons declaim (to summarise) that the people voted for Brexit and they must not be denied it.  In the same week, we have had a further raft of dismal economic figures which show the UK, weighed down by Brexit uncertainty, is in grim shape even before we get to the horrors of the actual breakaway from the huge free-trade bloc.  Yet, we are told, the Brexiters will jolly well have what they voted for. They will not be swayed by the realities of the situation, which they seem to regard as propaganda by people they oh-so-tiresomely refer to as \u0026ldquoRemoaners. Albeit the schoolboyish \u0026ldquoRemoaner jibe is certainly preferable to the \u0026ldquotraitor comments you sometimes hear bandied around when it comes to Brexit. \u0026ldquoTraitor is an extreme word, and its use by some Leave voters underlines the divisive and intolerant nature of Brexit.  Fears over the state of the UK economy intensified this week when official data revealed the sharpest monthly drop in manufacturing output since October 2012. The 1.4 per cent month-on-month plunge will surely be a disappointment to some in the Brexit camp (even if they will not admit it). It highlights not only the domestic economic malaise but also the fact that sterling weakness arising from the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit vote does not appear to have been the catalyst for a lasting export boom.  Read More: Fears over UK economy intensify as manufacturing output plunges  Not than anyone should have expected it to be such a catalyst. After all, you would imagine all the uncertainty around trade arrangements after Blighty quits the European Union would not be trumped by a pricing advantage for UK exporters arising from sterling weakness. Especially given the pound\u0026rsquos troubles have sent UK companies\u0026rsquo import costs rocketing.  Also this week, we have had figures from the Office for National Statistics signalling underlying weakness in the UK construction sector. The data showed construction output rose by just 0.5% in April, having tumbled by 2.3% in March as freezing weather disrupted activity. Economists had forecast construction output would have bounced back by 2% in April.  Meanwhile, trade figures this week from the ONS were dire.  The UK\u0026rsquos global goods trade deficit widened from \u0026pound12 billion in March to \u0026pound14.04bn in April, much worse than the \u0026pound11.35bn forecast by economists, as exports fell sharply and imports rose. The deterioration was driven by a widening of the UK\u0026rsquos deficit on trade in goods with countries outwith the EU, from \u0026pound3.79bn to \u0026pound5.37bn.  Read More: Ian McConnell: Man in Lego boat without paddle sums up Brexit fiasco frustration  Many Brexiters still believe that increased trade with non-EU countries \u0026ndash perceived by the Leave camp to be wildly enthusiastic about doing more business with the mighty UK \u0026ndash will be an economic panacea. The Brexiters\u0026rsquo head-in-the-British-sand attitude has meant the absence of any catalyst for their imagined boom in UK trade with countries outside the EU has not dampened their bizarre enthusiasm.  At the end of the day, Brexit is a fool\u0026rsquos errand driven by ideology and not by considerations of people\u0026rsquos standards of living, which are dictated in large part by economic success or otherwise. Xenophobia and opposition to immigration look to have been key factors in the Brexit vote.  You still hear the Brexiters bang on about the benefits of leaving the EU. These remain entirely elusive but that, it seems, does not matter one whit to the Brexiters. All the while, some of them harp on about the fabulous bounties which Blighty is going to reap from a raft of new free-trade deals. This would be laughable in its ridiculousness if the consequences for the economy and people\u0026rsquos living standards were not so serious.  Read More: Ian McConnell: Fears for economy grow as millions hit by Brexit cost of living crisis  And what about the growing protectionism when it comes to world trade? One of those countries at the forefront of this is the US, which some in the UK Government seem to believe is going to be falling over itself to do one of the fastest-arranged trade deals of modern times with Britain, even though nothing of substance has happened on this front in the two years since the Brexit vote.  Meanwhile, there is no sign that the other countries which the UK Government has had its sights on, in its desperate lobbying mission to try to make Brexit look like a good idea, will be putting Britain ahead of the massive and powerful EU bloc in the queue for trade deals. Why would these countries prioritise foolishly by putting an isolated UK ahead of the huge EU bloc?  And this brings us back to the essence of the problem.  The UK is a sizeable economy. However, its influence is dwindling as other countries rise. Faced with such challenges, being part of a powerful bloc such as the EU has been hugely important.  Many in the Brexit camp seem to believe the UK is the most important country in the world. They need to wake up to the fact the UK Government\u0026rsquos ridiculously over-elevated sense of the country\u0026rsquos importance does not chime at all with the reality of today\u0026rsquos world.  Chance would be a fine thing though. Instead, the Brexiters and their Government at Westminster seem hell-bent on pursuing a dream of making the UK an economic backwater, with a funny little mindset when it comes to the big world out there."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7928927.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Meet schoolgirl  12  taking powerboat world by storm","story":"              MOST 12-year-olds spend their free time at the cinema or chatting with friends on social media.

The youngster\u0026rsquos progress in the male-dominated world of powerboat racing has been rapid.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspIn at the deep end when Powerboating came to Greenock  She won the RYA Honda RIB Scottish final last month at Port Edgar, recording the fastest time in the junior section, and will this year compete in the Powerboat GP racing series in England in the under-16 category.  Now the High School of Glasgow pupil is heading to London\u0026rsquos iconic Royal Victoria Docks where she will take part in the UIM F1H2O Grand Prix alongside top international racers including Shaun Torrente and Philippe Chiappe.    Oban said: \u0026ldquoI can\u0026rsquot wait.

She said her interest was sparked when she was eight years old and joined her family for a day out on a rigid-hulled inflatable boat.      And, when it comes to action and adventure, Oban is clearly a chip off the old block.  Her father, Ewen, 46, is an industrial firefighter while her mother, Karen, 49, who used to be in the Army, now works in security.  \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoMy husband\u0026rsquos an industrial firefighter.

She secured the role after being invited to a global gathering in Sri Lanka in 2016 where she spoke about her experiences before hundreds of delegates from over 50 countries.  The youngster\u0026rsquos next challenge will involve taking out a single-seater measuring 3.1 metres in length, with up to 10 other boats from around the UK competing in each race.

President Vladimir Putin certainly thinks so. In his opening speech at the unveiling of the 21st World Cup finals on Thursday he said: \u0026ldquoFootball brings us together in one single team and we are united by our affection \u0026hellip by different language, ideology or faith. All that missing was an exhortation for us all to join hands together in a rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow.  The Greatest Show on Earth isn\u0026rsquot a carnival of peace and goodwill it\u0026rsquos predatory and materialistic and a quadrennial celebration of the credo that might is right and greed is good. Nor can football fanatics like me who fancy ourselves to be all liberal and enlightened claim it has only lately come to be this way and that it has fallen victim to corporate and financial muscle: it\u0026rsquos always been like this. You can add other stuff to the brimstone and treacle like xenophobia, national paranoia, revenge and the mentality of the mob.  The second World Cup held in Italy in 1934 and won by the host nation did not feature Uruguay, the tournament\u0026rsquos first winners and hosts in 1930. Even after four years the South Americans were still nursing a grievance that Italy and several other European nations had refused the invitation to compete in Uruguay. There were loftier reasons the Uruguayans could have cited for their absence, none more so than Benito Mussolini using the tournament as a showcase for his fascist dictatorship and the lingering suspicion that he had personally hand-picked the referees for games involving Italy.  Argentina\u0026rsquos military junta copied Mussolini\u0026rsquos opportunism when they hosted the World Cup in 1978. It was well-known that thousands of Argentinians were \u0026lsquodisappeared\u0026rsquo by the regime on suspicion of disloyalty but FIFA, football\u0026rsquos governing body, obviously felt this was a trifling matter and one that had nothing to do with football. The rest of us too shut our eyes and passed by meekly on the other side of the road. We do this every time the World Cup comes about and we do it when it comes to the Champions League and to our own domestic competitions. Where football is concerned we become amoral automatons, happy to overlook petty corruption, profiteering and the sort of attitudes towards fairness and equality that make Jacob Rees-Mogg look like the president of Unicef.  In our real lives we might march against poverty and rail against low wages and unemployment. We seek fair distribution of wealth and an end to the huge gaps in health and education that exist in our society caused by social inequality. When it comes to football, though, we leave all of these ethics at the turnstile. You could fit the wage bill of the entire Scottish Premier Division inside the payroll of my team, Celtic, and there would still be some change. Yet, not a jot do I care.  I celebrated a second successive treble in the same manner as I would have done if we had defeated Real Madrid and Bayern Munich on the way. I am impervious to the privations of other clubs. Celtic were forced kicking and screaming into paying the Living Wage for its lowest-paid employees and then only after withdrawing the bonus scheme these people had previously relied upon. This didn\u0026rsquot stop me renewing my \u0026pound627 season ticket. Do I want my club to share some of its riches with the honest and deserving poor amongst its fellow clubs? I most certainly do not. In life I am a socialist but football has made me a capitalist and an implacable one at that.  Football really does think it\u0026rsquos a force for world peace and reconciliation. In reality, though, its mere presence endorses and exonerates regimes involved in crimes against humanity. And it anaesthetises the rest of us into a sort of moral stupor where we suspend any notions we might previously have had about constitutes right and wrong. We even find ourselves exhibiting some of the most wretched tendencies harboured by the World Cup. I was desperate for Egypt to beat Uruguay yesterday afternoon and not because of the pyramids and Mo Salah. Rather, I still haven\u0026rsquot forgiven Uruguay for kicking Scotland off the park at Mexico 32 years ago. Reconciliation: aye right.  When FIFA\u0026rsquos World Cup comes to town the host nation is expected to pay tribute by suspending its normal customs and conventions. The first to go are usually those built around decency, honesty and compassion. Thus in Brazil in 2014, in cities with some of the most appalling rates of poverty and multi-deprivation, vital infrastructure projects were suspended to help pay for the swanky new stadiums. Contracts were carved up by government-favoured companies with links to organised crime.  FIFA, you see, operates as a mendicant global superstate unhindered by the conventions of the EU, the UN or NATO. It does as it pleases and the corruption that riddled it went unchecked for decades simply because national governments feared the popular consequences of sanctions being applied to its football teams. No wonder Vladimir Putin was beaming from the best seat in the house at Moscow\u0026rsquos Luzhniki Stadium on Thursday. He knows that for a few weeks the world will conveniently choose to forget his crackdown on the LGBTI community as the Russian police are tasked with seeking out any displays of physical affection by gay people.  Yet I have dutifully set my television to record every game of this World Cup and have already spent a right few quid trying to fill my Panini World Cup sticker album. Football, for all the shallow caprices at its core, retains those values that first attracted us to it in the purity and innocence of childhood: the feeling of belonging to something important of finding a common interest that overcomes feelings of inadequacy. In my own west of Scotland it still provides the language by which some parents rendered sullen by an aggregation of social defeats can communicate and reach out emotionally to their children. It provides moments that come to form part of our families\u0026rsquo shared memories. It permits children whom the elite have judged and found wanting to dream of glory and a lifestyle beyond their expectations. And it lets the rest of us simply derive pleasure from seeing some of them do so."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/5402237.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Remembered  at last  the hungry people who made Glasgow","story":"              Switching between English and Gaeilge, an Irish minister of state on Friday told of the hunger that drove thousands from his island to Glasgow. \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot always easy, Joe McHugh said, for Ireland\u0026rsquos famine refugees \u0026ldquoThey felt marginalised. Some faced discrimination and exclusion.  Then the Fine Gael politician said something that suggested a new mood about an event that changed Scotland as well as his own country. The potato blight of the 1840s, he declared, hit \u0026ldquoall traditions and all four provinces.  As Mr McHugh spoke, Edward Hyde let out a grunt of approval. His head was lowered as if in prayer, his chin pointed at his Orange Lodge tie and red poppy lapel badge.  This was the dedication of Glasgow\u0026rsquos first monument to those who those who fled the potato famine, 17 decades after they arrived in a depression- and disease-hit city.  And, unlike any of hundreds of other such memorials, this one remembers both Irish and Scot, both Catholic and Protestant.  And so Mr McHugh, and Mr Hyde found some reconciliation, as well as remembrance, in a little garden by the People\u0026rsquos Palace in Glasgow Green.  Mr Hyde, grand secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, served on the steering group that took six - sometimes difficult years - trying to find a way to mark the great hunger, the Gorta M\u0026oacuter.  He said: \u0026ldquoMy grandfather - like Mr McHugh - was from Donegal. The blight didn\u0026rsquot choose who to affect, it affected all communities. People think it was only Catholics who suffered.  It was Mr Hyde, he said, who came up with a living memorial, inspired by an abandoned village in Cork turned in to a place to remember the famine\u0026rsquos victims, the million dead, the two million forced to flee to the New World or the old.  The Irish and Highland Famine Memorial Garden is designed to die in winter and grow back in the summer. At its centre is an upturned boat with a simple message on its hull: \u0026ldquoEven the birds were silent in grief. As officials explained its symbolism, grasses and wildflowers swayed in a chilly June breeze that carried a thick scent from a brewery upwind.  Glasgow City Council\u0026rsquos deputy leader, David McDonald, referred to the path those visiting can take through the garden. There had been \u0026ldquobollards and blockages along the way, he admitted. The project had been condemned, initially, as \u0026ldquoamateur and historically inaccurate by the Professor Sir Tom Devine. On Friday the pre-eminent historian of the period followed Mr McDonald and Mr McHugh to dedicate the garden.  Later he said: \u0026ldquoThis is an inclusive memorial to protestant Irish, catholic Irish and the Gaels, most of whom were of the Presbyterian persuasion.  \u0026ldquoThat is a potent reminder for today of how immigration, even of the displaced and distressed, can ultimately have a positive impact on the host society.  Nobody was pretending that Glasgow opened its arms to the Irish - or the Scottish Gaels whose famine, though far less deadly than Ireland\u0026rsquos, also drove them to the Clyde.  But the message, from Ireland and Scotland, on Friday was that refugees and migrants ultimately benefit host nations and cities. The Scottish Refugee Council was one of the partners behind the memorial.  Baillie Norman MacLeod - of mixed Scots Gaelic and Irish stock - explained. \u0026ldquoWe cannot say the welcome was as it should have been, he said before remembering Highland and Irish migrants were followed by Italians, Jews, Lithuanians and Pakistanis and whole new generation of new Scots from the EU. \u0026ldquoThis is what has made Glasgow what we are: a proudly multi-ethnic city.  The garden is overlooked by the Doulton Fountain, a ceramic monument to Victoria, the \u0026ldquofamine queen and her empire. The monarch, in fact, personally sympathised with the starving Irish. Her government did not.  What did Mr McHugh think of Victoria? The minister smiled and talked of today\u0027s Queen visiting Dublin. \u0026ldquoAll that is part of reconciliation, he said \u0026ldquoWe are moving into a new space to try understand our past, warts and all, and respect where we are now.  \u0026ldquoWhen we look at global mass movement today because of conflict and hunger, we should try to learn from our experiences.  The making of a monument  FIVE years ago Sir Tom Devine was not impressed. A proposed monument to the Irish famine, he said, was \"founded on comforting myth and unproven beliefs\".  Glasgow council - some 17 decades after the hunger of 1847 - had effectively just patted itself on the back with a motion to erect a monument to its own generosity.  The city agreed to a memorial to the great hunger but wanted to \"recognise the efforts made by Glaswegians at the time to provide relief and sanctuary to those affected\".    Professor Sir Tom Devine  It took Sir Tom, the country\u0027s pre-eminent historian, to insist Scotland instead acknowledged uncomfortable truth. Yes, perhaps 100,000 Irish found shelter in Glasgow, but half were sent home. And their arrival, the professor said, marked a watershed in anti-Irish, anti-Catholic bigotry.  Glasgow listened to Sir Tom. Its memorial garden reflects the unfiltered stories of Irish - protestant and Catholic - and Highlanders who came to Glasgow to escape hunger. An exhibition also explains the context of that cold welcome. Glasgow in the late 1940s was in enduring a depression. There was typhus then cholera. \"The burial rate quadrupled,\" the historian explained. Among those moaning of an Irish \"visitation\" was the Roman Catholic bishop, John Murdoch, who was watching his own priests die.  \"As far as I am aware they went through at least eight iterations,\" Sir Tom said of the history boards that form an essential part of the garden. \"They now bear no relationship to the inaccuracies of that first narrative.  \"I said before that the beast of sectarianism was not quiet dead but it is no longer red in tooth and claw.  \"For that I was condemned by some for being too optimistic. But the fact is that the council has made a public demonstration that we must now regard the people of Glasgow \u0026ndash whatever their religious traditions - as part of the same family. Glasgow has delivered.\""},{"url":null,"title":"SNP leadership plans its   39 frustration strategy  39  to disrupt Government business at Westminster","story":"              SNP chiefs are this weekend expected to map out their \u0026ldquofrustration strategy aimed at disrupting UK Government business at Westminster in the wake of Theresa May\u0026rsquos decision to plough ahead with the Brexit Bill in the face of Holyrood\u0026rsquos opposition.

He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not prepared to get into what we\u0026rsquore going to do over the next few weeks. We will be taking it one step at a time.  Some of Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos colleagues have suggested that the \u0026ldquotemplate for the SNP\u0026rsquos frustration strategy should be the obstructionist actions of Charles Stewart Parnell and the Irish Nationalists of the 19th century, who used a number of parliamentary devices to \u0026ldquogum up Westminster\u0026rsquos business. These included making overly lengthy speeches, tabling numerous amendments and calling continual votes.  On Wednesday, the SNP leader deployed the unusual parliamentary technique of calling on the Speaker to allow a vote to enable the Commons to sit in private session. This would have meant, if passed, the public would have been ejected as well as journalists, so that the proceedings would not have been recorded.  On Monday, MPs will take part in a so-called SO24 debate on the issue of Brexit and devolution, the subject of which caused so much controversy earlier this week when Commons exchanges on the subject took up just 15 minutes with another four devoted to the issue of the Northern Irish border.  Elsewhere, Mr Blackford has written to Mrs May to complain about the actions of Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, who he said had shouted \"suicide\" at the Nationalist benches when the party asked the Speaker what options were available to them concerning the lack of debate on devolution and their claim of a Whitehall power-grab.  \u0026ldquoTo shout \u0027suicide\u0027 across the chamber is not fitting of a Member of Parliament and it should not be tolerated, declared the SNP leader.  \u0026ldquoA few months ago, I met with the Prime Minister and other party leaders to discuss how we can combat bullying behaviour in the House of Commons. It was agreed that we should find a solution.  \u0026ldquoThis is not the first time our MPs have suffered abuse in the chamber. Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames was forced to apologise to Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh during a statement by the Foreign Secretary, for making \u0026lsquowoofing\u0026rsquo noises at her.  \"This sort of behaviour is unacceptable MPs must lead by example. I have suggested to the Prime Minister that she raises this issue with the House next week,\" added the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber.  But Mr Liddell-Grainger has hit back, insisting he referred to \u0026ldquopolitical suicide and as a former soldier was well aware of mental health issues.  He claimed his remark had been blown out of proportion and criticised the SNP for raising the issue after he had left the chamber, an action he branded \u0026ldquopathetic and cowardly.  The Tory backbencher added: \"As a Scot I am not prepared to take lessons from a bunch of people who have not only ruined their country but who can\u0026rsquot be bothered to listen properly to what people say. They can take their objections and stuff them.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Unspun  the political diary","story":"              THERE was limitless cynicism around the SNP walk-out at PMQs.

It will make for a busy summer in Waverley Gate. Especially as the body has, as well as its normal functions, a review of its funding system to carry out, and, as the new chairman Robert Wilson has now said, a review of its entire form, function and structure. So there\u0027s a lot of work to do.  And it seems inevitable that at least some changes will be made, either in structure or in personnel.  Why inevitable? Because if Creative Scotland has one primary task it is to decide who, in the wide and eclectic world of Scotland\u0027s culture, gets funding and why. And also, who doesn\u0027t, and why not. And to do so clearly and with some understandable rationale.  However, in the last round of Regular Funding, its decision makers managed to create confusion where they should have been clarity, bewilderment where there could have been comprehension, and, once again, alienated artists and companies who, after all, should be the object of their key relationships. That the Regular Funding debacle - if that is not too strong a term, which it may not be - happened after a relatively generous Budget settlement from the Government, rather than savage cuts, adds to the appearance of a wholly avoidable mess. It looks dysfunctional.  I was told last week not to expect fast or dramatic changes at the top of Creative Scotland. And its leadership has issues with some of the Committees assertions and findings. It has also had six months, or so, to begin to mend fences, and contemplate how and why it does things.

Will he sweep clean?"},{"url":null,"title":"Bumper fruit crop means juicy deals for shoppers","story":"              They are the ultimate taste of summer, and thanks to the beast from the east and the spring heatwave, Scots are tucking into 6.5m extra \u0026lsquosupersize\u0026rsquo strawberries.  The unusual weather conditions have meant there\u0026rsquos an unexpected glut of Scottish strawberries, said to be larger, sweeter and juicier than normal.  It\u0026rsquos led to a boost for shoppers, who are snapping up cut-price punnets of high quality fruit as supermarkets battle to clear the backlog and avoid stocks going to waste.  The Scottish strawberry season has been thrown into confusion by the cold snap at the start of the year which caused some varieties of berries to take longer to reach maturity.  Then, the recent hot conditions have sped up the ripening process for other varieties of strawberries \u0026ndash creating larger and juicier fruit much earlier in the season.  The unusual climate conditions have now sparked predictions of a bumper strawberry season.  However, the downside is that tonnes of Scottish berries which would normally ripen at different times, are hitting the market together - and clashing with the English strawberry season which is already underway.  The extra stock has caused supermarket prices to crash, meaning shoppers are picking up giant-sized punnets containing extra-large strawberries for a fraction of their normal cost.  In a bid to help suppliers tackle a massive surplus of stock, cut-price supermarket Aldi has now has stepped in to snap up more than 80 tonnes of Scottish strawberries.  The chain, which has started selling kilo-gram size \u0026lsquosuper-punnets\u0026rsquo at its Scottish stores, says the move is also intended to prevent fruit going to waste.  Julie Ashfield, managing director of Buying at Aldi UK, said: \u0026ldquoThe recent warm weather has led to our growers needing to harvest a vast amount of their crop much later than usual. We always try to find ways to support them in times like this, while at the same time reducing unnecessary food waste.  \u0026ldquoScottish strawberries are also typically brighter in colour and tastier compared with imported varieties, meaning our customers can enjoy more of the fruit at the best time of the year.  The supermarket, which earlier this month struck a deal to buy 700,000 potatoes from a UK supplier faced with a bumper crop, is selling its larger strawberry punnets at \u0026pound2.95 per kg in a bid to move stock as fast as possible.  Despite the over-supply, farmers are to receive the same rate per kilogram of fruit from Aldi as normal.  David Stephen of Barra Berries, Oldmeldrum near Inverurie, said any major over-supply of fruit is normally curtailed because of the controlled conditions in which berries are grown.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos not usually a huge over-supply because fruit is grown in tunnels which means that to a large extent its protected from the elements.  \u0026ldquoHowever, there\u0026rsquos always a slight problem if the English and Scottish crops pick up at the exact same time.  Predictions of a bumper harvest have added to farmers\u0026rsquo concerns over attracting adequate numbers of workers to pick the crops.  Some farmers are said to be paying for flights for teams of fruit-pickers from Bulgaria in a desperate move to avoid losing their crops.  Some have blamed the impact of Brexit, which they say has left workers from Bulgaria and Poland reluctant to travel to the UK to work.  There have also been claims that \u0026lsquogangmasters\u0026rsquo have been operating around some farms, intent on luring fruit-pickers to rival fields.  Production of strawberries and raspberries in Scotland has nearly doubled over the past decade, mostly driven by strawberry sales.  Thanks to polytunnels and new varieties of strawberries which have been developed to give improved flavour, appearance, longevity, yield and shelf life, fruit farmers are able to stretch what used to be a brief berry season, to last from May - and sometimes earlier - through to October. They now produce around 25,000 tonnes of strawberries each year.  Geoff Bruce, of Bruce Farms in Meigle, Perthshire, which supplies soft fruit for Scotty Brand, said the season has already produced impressive yields of particularly succulent and sweet strawberries.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos down to the weather, but to be honest we\u0026rsquore so busy I can hardly remember what the weather was like yesterday, never mind a few weeks ago.  \u0026ldquoThere are always good bits and less good bits in every season. It\u0026rsquos a long season and we have to just hope it continues like this.  The Scottish soft fruit industry, mostly based in Tayside and Fife, is worth \u0026pound100m a year."},{"url":null,"title":"Tom Gordon  Tory Brexit insults are helping the SNP s case on devolution","story":"              THE noisy walk-out staged by SNP MPs in the Commons on Wednesday marked the start of a new obstructionist phase for the party, we\u0026rsquore told.  Filibusters and obscure parliamentary devices to disrupt Westminster business and delay Brexit legislation are afoot.  The cosy days are over, and the Nats are about to cut up rough.  Well, possibly. You can be sure Speaker Bercow is already swotting up on possible \u0026ldquoguerilla tactics, and what he can do about them.  The walk-out succeeded in drawing attention to the \u0026lsquopower grab\u0026rsquo in the EU Withdrawal Bill and the pathetic 19 minutes of pseudo-debate given over to its devolved aspects the previous day.  But the law of diminishing returns risks any obstructionist looking juvenile and tiresome after a while. Voters also tend to prefer hard-working MPs over jesters.  To me, the walk-out also marked the start of the 2021 Holyrood election campaign, and the launch of the SNP\u0026rsquos theme, one that Brexit has given real traction: \u0026lsquoDevolution is dead, long live independence\u0026rsquo.  Right now, that might sound a bit fanciful. Devolution is plainly not dead, even if it\u0026rsquos been in better health. But there are almost three years to the election, and I suspect the SNP will be using them all to bang home that it\u0026rsquos on its last legs.  As the party found in 2014, the Union is a tough target. It has 300 years of history behind it. It is self-evidently durable. Many voters are vehemently attached to it.  But devolution is a softer affair. People are glad its here, sure enough, but are they brimming with passion about it? Are campaigners knocking doors on a wet Tuesday night for it?  Far better, therefore, to stop railing against the Union and start regretting the failure of devolution.  Despite resisting it, the SNP won\u0026rsquot condemn devolution. Rather, they may reflect it has been a worthy experiment. But, alas, an experiment that after 20 years has plainly run its course. Hence the need to vote for something new with a bit of life in it.  Nicola Sturgeon knows she can\u0026rsquot extract a referendum from a DUP-reliant Theresa May in this parliament. She also needs time to refresh the case for independence.  She knows the middle way of \u0026lsquomore powers\u0026rsquo was popular in 2014. But if that option was taken out the equation because, as you\u0026rsquoll hear ad nauseam, devolution really isn\u0026rsquot working anymore, in a polarised choice between post-Brexit Tory Westminster and independence, then independence has a shot.  So come 2021 she\u0026rsquoll ask voters to give the SNP an irresistible mandate for that referendum and to give devolution a decent burial.  In this endeavour, Brexit is her friend. It may not have given the SNP the boost it expected after the EU referendum, but it is still early days. Besides the economic pain, lack of a plan, Tory infighting and Westminster chaos, it has also exposed the limits of devolution.  It is Nat 1.01 that Westminster is sovereign and can impose law on Scotland, regardless of Holyrood\u0026rsquos wishes. That has always been the case. But theory is one thing, practice another. Brexit has opened a lot of eyes. Suddenly, people can see the electrified fence and the sign on it saying \u0027thus far and no further\u0027.  There was a lot of campaign hype about Westminster pressing ahead with the EU Withdrawal Bill against Holyrood\u0026rsquos wishes on Tuesday.  Ms Sturgeon was wrong to say the Tories had \u0026ldquoripped up the Sewel convention, which says Westminster will \u0026ldquonot normally legislate in devolved areas without Holyrood\u0026rsquos consent. It does not say \u0026ldquonever.  It was also mince for SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford to claim one example in 20 years had turned \u0026ldquoSewel on its head.  However both were right to say it was unprecedented, and both were right to call out the insult of the UK government ramming it through.  That played straight into the SNP narrative that the Tories never wanted devolution, and are now killing it by neglect if not by design. Scottish Secretary David Mundell stressed it was not \u0026ldquoa new normal.  But the SNP now plans to play hardball with other Brexit-related legislation and it may well become the new normal. There are likely to be more Holyrood refusals, more confrontations, more departures from the Sewel convention. The UK government is on a fixed schedule. Even if it had the inclination to bargain, it doesn\u0026rsquot have the time.  The SNP know it, and so plan to position Holyrood in front of the Brexit juggernaut and let it get run over for the cameras.  Critics will call it breaking the system in order to complain the system is broken, others will say it is resisting rotten legislation and exposing the confines of devolution.  Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos strategy might pay off. I wouldn\u0026rsquot discount it.  But it won\u0026rsquot be easy. She could come a cropper in an early general election. Voters might turn against SNP MPs who don\u0026rsquot appear serious about Westminster. A Labour win would rob her of a Tory bogeyman on which to pin devolution\u0026rsquos end.  Making 2021 about a second referendum also writes the sales pitch for her opponents. They will run a \u0026lsquoSack Sturgeon\u0026rsquo campaign, urging voters to bin the FM and settle the independence question.  On paper, there is no election of any kind in Scotland this year, or next year or in 2020. But don\u0026rsquot relax too soon. The great three-year campaign is already upon us."},{"url":null,"title":"SNP-supporting tycoon Brian Souter criticises wealthy for being  quot narcissistic quot  and  quot self-obsessed quot ","story":"              HE is one of the country\u0026rsquos most successful businessmen and his family is estimated to be worth nearly \u0026pound1billion.  But Sir Brian Souter, who has also ploughed in part of his fortune to the SNP, has taken aim at his fellow millionaires.  At a prayer breakfast earlier this month, the transport tycoon said the most \u0026ldquonarcissistic and \u0026ldquoself-obsessed people he had met were rich.  He added that wealthy people are in need of \u0026ldquotransformation in their lives just as much as heroin addicts.  Souter and his sister Ann Gloag made their money by founding Scottish-based bus company Stagecoach, which also owns coach operator Megabus and South West Trains.  Stagecoach serves around 2.5 million passengers a day and the transport giant also operates in North America. Souter and Gloag were said to be worth \u0026pound920 million, although it was reported last year that the siblings had split their wealth in order to follow \"different investment strategies\".  Souter is also known for his charitable giving via his family trust, which has awarded more than \u0026pound32 million over the last three years.  An evangelical Christian who is linked to the Church of the Nazarene, the tycoon\u0026rsquos charity is interested in projects that relieve human suffering and promote spiritual welfare.  Souter recently fronted an event in Edinburgh at which he promoted the theory of \u0026ldquotransformation, which in Christianity focuses on changing individual lives.  He interviewed a former heroin addict, Alfie McCracken, who told of how he used to be homeless and had considered taking his own life.  In conversation with Souter, McCracken said his life changed after he visited a church in Largs and was \u0026ldquosmothered in love. He said he found Jesus and stopped using drugs.  Souter then made a speech in which he said \u0026ldquorules and \u0026ldquorole models are not enough to transform lives, a process that also requires a \u0026ldquoredeemer.  He claimed McCracken had found his redeemer: \u0026ldquoWhen he [Alfie] had an encounter with Jesus Christ, transformation happened in his life. When a supernatural power, greater than his own, was able to deliver him from the addiction of heroin.  However, he added that other individuals did not feel their own lives required the same change: \u0026ldquoI meet a lot of wealthy people in my walk of life, and let me tell you, they need transformation just as much as Alfie.  Souter added: \u0026ldquoThe most narcissistic, self-obsessed people I have met have had a lot of money, and I don\u0026rsquot find that amongst the homeless. The truth is we all need transformation.  The tycoon\u0027s political donations have attracted more attention than his charitable giving. Souter has donated over \u0026pound2m to the SNP and pro-independence causes, including sizeable pre-election donations.  He also spent over \u0026pound1 million in 2000 bankrolling a private referendum opposing Government plans to repeal anti-gay rights legislation. His high-profile campaign was widely criticised by MSPs, who believed he was hijacking democracy in a bid to keep a discriminatory law.  Christian Wolmer, who wrote a book in the 1990s which charted the rise of Stagecoach, said of Souter\u0026rsquos remarks:  \u0026ldquoI am glad that Brian is prepared to be critical of some of his fellow millionaires but it is a mistake to think that only religion offers solutions. If the rich paid taxes commensurate with their income and their wealth, then there would be sufficient money in the public services to ensure that there would be fewer people like Alfie who find themselves in bad situations.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe rich need to develop a social conscience, recognise the problem of inequality and be prepared to put back into society what they have gained from it. To be fair, I do recognise that Brian does that."},{"url":null,"title":"Alex Salmond says he urged Ian Blackford to adopt more disruptive tactics ahead of SNP Commons walkout","story":"              ALEX Salmond says he was behind the SNP\u0027s dramatic mass walkout at Westminster.  SNP MPs stormed out of the Commons chamber earlier this week when Ian Blackford was kicked out by the speaker during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions amid protests that MPs had not been given enough time to consider over 50 amendments to the Brexit bill on devolution.  Salmond said he suggested the dramatic protest during a chat with Blackford, the SNP\u0027s Westminster leader.  The former First Minister said Blackford phoned him on the eve of the clash.  \u0026ldquoOne of the iron laws of parliamentary politics is that if you always play the Westminster game then you will always lose,\" Salmond told the Sunday Herald.  \"And the way to turn that round successfully is to target interventions at those occasions which mean so much to the Westminster establishment - PMQs, budgets, state openings etc, and then use their own procedures against them.  \"Certainly that was my advice to Ian Blackford when he phoned me last Tuesday night and I was delighted to see him carry it through.\"  Salmond said he was filming in Gibraltar for a TV programme about Brexit when Blackford sought his advice about taking on the Tories.  Writing in today\u0027s Sunday Herald, Blackford blasted the \"absolute scandal\" of what he said was a lack of debate on a \"power grab\".  After the transfer of powers from Brussels to Whitehall and Westminster, London will take charge of policy areas traditionally devolved to Holyrood.  The SNP has said that means completely demolishing the principle at the heart of the devolution settlement by giving Westminster the final say on many devolved policy areas.  The UK wants to retain control over 24 devolved areas, most related to agriculture, fisheries and the environment, for up to seven years.  Blackford said MPs had been given just 15 minutes to debate the measures in the EU Withdrawal Bill, and warned that the stand off was a \"defining moment when the UK Parliament chose to reject devolution\".  Blackford is to use a debate in Westminster tomorrow (Monday) to make the case for emergency legislation to halt the \"power grab\".  Salmond was famously thrown out of the Commons chamber in 1988 after he interrupted the then chancellor, Nigel Lawson, in mid-flow.  In a dramatic move, Salmond \u0026ndash who had been an MP for just a year \u0026ndash spoke out against the controversial poll tax, a flagship policy of the Thatcher government.  After barracking Lawson and becoming the first MP in history to break parliamentary convention by intervening during the Chancellor\u0026rsquos budget, Salmond was ordered to leave the Commons.  In a frank admission, Salmond said that some SNP MPs between 2015 and 2017 had been \"intent on winning the gold star for good attendance rather than independence\".  He suggested that the SNP\u0027s loss of 21 seats in the 2017 general election was partly due to it becoming too comfortable with the Westminster set up.  Salmond, who was one of the SNP\u0027s casualties last year, said the walkout was a return to a much more effective style of opposition by the party.  \"The challenge for the SNP is to keep up the momentum. Westminster is treating Scotland with contempt,\" he said.  \"Now they are receiving a taste of their own medicine.  \"If they want business as usual then they should get their mitts off the powers of the Scottish Parliament.  \"In my opinion the SNP fell into the Westminster trap after 2015 and then paid the price at the polls.  \"Too many of the current crop of MPs then seemed intent on winning the gold star for good attendance rather than independence. Now all that has changed and well done to them.  \"The people who send the SNP south expect their MPs to shake it up, not settle down.  In response, a UK Government spokesman said: \"The UK Government is proceeding entirely in line with devolution. Rather than manufacture grievance the SNP should be working with us to get best deal for people in Scotland as we leave the EU.

After the shock in May 2014, fears about the continued existence of the building subsided and it appeared that, by some miracle, it was salvageable. Rather than devastation, the tale was shaping up take its place in history is a miraculous escape. It would take more than that to break a building which held such passion and history within its walls.  It\u0026rsquos difficult to articulate the richness of that history, and its importance to Glasgow. The Mackintosh building cements the place of Charles Rennie Mackintosh into the fabric of the city. It sits among the buzz of the bustle, both soaking up the Glasgow culture and helping define it.  The building has occupied its place in the Glasgow landscape since 1899, when the first half of the project was completed. It was designed by Rennie Mackintosh, then a junior draughtsman at firm Honeyman and Keppie, which submitted the plans as part of an architectural competition.  The school itself, as an institution, was founded more than 50 years before, and had already gained a substantial reputation in the field. Before it settled in its new home in Renfrew Street, in the glory of Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos design, it had enjoyed stints in the Merchant City\u0026rsquos Ingram Street and the McLellan Galleries.  The prestigious institution went on to hold a number of academic schools: the Mackintosh School of Architecture, the School of Design, the School of Fine Art, the School of Simulation and Visualisation, and the Innovation School.  While maintaining its reputation as a revered place of study and continuing to appeal to international students as well as local, the School of Art, and in particular the Mackintosh building, has been popular with tourists as a place of historical and cultural significance.  Its relevance to modern art as well as history is undisputed. The School has been host to numerous winners and nominees of the Turner Prize in recent times, such as Richard Wright, Simon Starling and Martin Boyce.  Indeed, it boasts a strong roster of alumni. As well as its most famous son, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Glasgow School of Art has also counted artist Peter Howson, Travis singer Fran Healy, author Alasdair Gray, former Doctor Who Peter Capaldi, former Scots Makar Liz Lochhead and broadcaster Muriel Gray among its students.  While Rennie Mackintosh is celebrated in the modern age and he has secured his place in the history of art and architecture, he wasn\u0026rsquot always appreciated in his time. Despite his unexpected success with the Art School design, he struggled to get other major commissions in his time. The Glasgow School of Art is the most emphatic physical expression of his contribution to cultural history, and the building therefore represents something bigger for Scotland than just as a hub of rich art and cultural nurturing.  For the city of Glasgow, it hurts. Locals have dealt with several tragedies in recent years. While there is relief at the lack of any casualties as a result of the fire, the same could not be said for the disasters in 2013, when a police helicopter crashed into the roof of the Clutha Bar, and at Christmas 2014, when a number of people were killed in the bin lorry tragedy in the centre of town.  The first fire at the School of Art almost became a ray of light after the initial shock and sadness had calmed. For once it seemed the city may have caught a small break when it became clear that the School could be saved and restored. Now, the double blow feels like a knockout punch to the gut for a city looking forward to a grand re-opening of the Mackintosh building next year. And if it hadn\u0026rsquot already seemed like the planets had for some reason aligned to seal the famous building\u0026rsquos fate, the added salt in the wound is that the second fire happened on the School\u0026rsquos graduation day.  Perhaps one of the most difficult things to consider when thinking, when writing, about events since Friday night is accepting that we now may be discussing the Mackintosh building as something that once existed. It is not the chapter of history anyone could have imagined. It feels cruel and unfair. It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine it as something that was, but that no longer is. Glasgow will, of course, recover, and the School\u0026rsquos admirable reputation will continue. For now, however, the city needs a moment to mourn. Then, the questions, and anger, will inevitably come."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils to benefit from new mentoring scheme","story":"\t\t\t\tMCR Pathways\u0026rsquo Young Scottish Talent initiative will be available to support disadvantaged and care-experienced pupils at St Machar, Banff, Inverurie, Fraserburgh and Peterhead Academies, as well as The Gordon Schools from August.                                                    The charity, which is being supported by The Wood Foundation as it expands its reach in the North-east, hopes to eventually be active in every City and Shire secondary school.                                                    The North-east is the first area for the nationwide expansion of the programme outside of Glasgow. Aberdeen has the second highest proportion of young people failing to move onto \u0026lsquopositive destinations\u0026rsquo when they leave school.        The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos UK Director Ali MacLachlan said: \u0026ldquoNurturing young people at this crossroads in their lives is vitally important in terms of supporting them to find the right path to fulfil their potential.\u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to learn that the North-east has such high rates of young people unable to move onto positive destinations after school. We must harness the potential of these young people to support the current and future economic performance of our region.\u0026ldquoMany of these vulnerable young people lack the stability and support many of us take for granted. This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break. They support pupils in S1 and 2 and match them with a mentor from S3.MCR Pathways is already operational across all Glasgow secondary schools where more than 1300 young people are supported each week through a mixture of group work, mentoring and work-based \u0026lsquoTalent Taster\u0026rsquo opportunities. More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference. This programme really does deliver profound results for some of the most vulnerable in our society.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoHelping a young person onto the right path at this stage really is life-changing. We continuously hear incredible stories including a mentee who went from a homeless unit to medical school and another who had to contend with family addiction issues and was four years behind in their education to graduating university and becoming a building surveyor.\u0026ldquoTheir stories, among countless other, have spurred us to roll out this project nationwide and we look forward to hearing of the successes of North-east youngsters in the years to come.The first information event for individuals and businesses keen to support the programme in the North-east will be held at The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos office in Aberdeen on Monday, June 18.To register, or for more information on future events, please contact Alison.maclachlan@thewoodfoundation.org.uk.

The issue was raised with Mr Clark by a constituent at a recent surgery, Alfred Middleton from Inverurie, who is a shareholder in RBS.                                                    The claimants secured a £200million settlement from RBS last summer.        However, solicitors for the claimants have not yet received all the money from RBS and only about £25million has been paid to investors so far. A legal battle is ongoing between the Action Group Company and Manx Capital, the investment vehicle and major claimant that took control of the mass legal claim and secured the settlement on behalf of the claimants..In his letter, Mr Clark said that investigations by a Sunday newspaper had raised serious questions about the credibility of the Action Group Company.He has joined parliamentary colleagues including Kevin Hollinrake, Conservative MP and co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking in calling for an inquiry.Mr Clark said: \u0026ldquoThis is an issue that was raised with me by a constituent that is directly affected by issues with the settlement agreed with RBS last summer.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoMany RBS shareholders believe that the rights issue undertaken by RBS in 2008 was promoted on a misleading basis.\u0026ldquoThey believe there were serious omissions of information which should have been brought to the attention of investors.\u0026ldquoThe RBS Shareholders Action Group Company was set up in 2009 purportedly to represent the interests of those investors.\u0026ldquoHowever, since the £200million settlement was agreed, a very small fraction of that sum has been paid out.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoThere are serious concerns about the Action Group Company and the lack of regulation in place to protect shareholders.\u0026ldquoI have now written to the Justice Secretary to join calls for an investigation into the RBS Shareholders Action Group Company, which should happen as a matter of urgency.
