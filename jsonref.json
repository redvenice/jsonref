OCD is a read, valid mental illness, that effects and can destroy lives.\u0027It\u0027s not something to make jokes about. I know for a fact that there would not be pyjamas with the jokes about depression, bipolar disorder, anorexia etc.\u0027          Social media users claim the logo \u0027trivialises\u0027 obsessive compulsive disorder and called it an insult to those living with the conditionThis incident comes after TK Maxx had to apologise and pull a line of \u0027OCD\u0027 kitchenware after receiving a backlash from campaigners online.The novelty Christmas items were emblazoned with the slogan \u0027I have O.C.D. * Obsessive Christmas Disorder\u0027.Ashley Fulwood, chief executive of OCD-UK, said this is not the first time they have had to battle offensive products.Ashley said: \u0027There are two issues - one is that it trivialises it and the second is that it fuels these misconceptions of OCD being something quirky. It fails to recognize that the D in OCD stands for disorder.\u0027It\u0027s not just a case of us being easily offended. People fail to realise how severe it can be. It destroys lives, relationships, careers and sadly we have tragic consequences of people taking their own lives.\u0027A Boohoo spokesman said they are investigating, adding: \u0027We are aware.\u0027          The festive set, on sale for £17, has OCD written on the top and \u0027Obsessive Christmas Disorder\u0027 underneath.

So he would speak to you in poems, and sometimes, he\u0027d talk in riddles, and it would be like: \u0027\u0027Stop that now\u0027\u0027. But we tried not to be like that,\u0027 he adds.Although Blakeley says that he doesn\u0027t know how much influence he had on West\u0027s music and art, he does admit: \u0027How much of Kanye was innate and nothing to do with us? It might have been us or might have been the environment we created. We were both musical, writers, and cultural. Did that provide the path to wherever he is?\u0027 Although West was different, he didn\u0027t get bullied and would stand up for himself, a trait he shared with everyone in his family.\u0027He was a tough little kid, not bully-able in any way, shape or form. I remember one time he was out in the park, a boy who was ten or eleven, and Kanye was only five, took his Frisbee and threw it in the tree,\u0027 says Blakeley.\u0027Kanye told him to get it down, but this boy just played around with him, so Kanye socked him, pow, he kicked his a**, regardless of his size. There\u0027s not this intellectual, nerdy reticence in him. There\u0027s nobody in his family like that, they\u0027re forthright and aggressive.\u0027But the family did go to church and Sunday School every week. Donda says in her book that they\u0027d attend Christ Universal Temple in Chicago, a black megachurch on the South Side: \u0027I wanted Kanye to be steeped in that kind of exposure to God.\u0027It\u0027s a little known fact that West also went to a \u0027positive thinking\u0027 kindergarten for black children called the New Concept Development Center, where he was taught Swahili by Donda\u0027s trusted friend and fellow professor, Haki Madhubuti.          The star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island (pictured) - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247          Blakeley said him and Donda \u0027installed into him an unshakable belief in his own talents, we encouraged him, and when he does things different, you don\u0027t judge anything he does\u0027When Donda and West went to China, they traveled to Thailand, frequenting the red light district of Bangkok and visiting nude beaches on Koh Samui. They also slummed it in the infamous Chungking Mansions, in Hong Kong, a ghetto block, notorious for its sex workers and drug peddlers.According to her book, Donda reveals: \u0027Once, Kanye and I literally took the slow boat from Canton to Hong Kong, where we\u0027d spend two weeks before going on to visit Thailand. \u0027In Hong Kong, we stayed in what became known as Slum King Mansion. The bath was down the hall and the room was definitely no-frills. The cost was eleven US dollars a night, if that tells you anything.EXCLUSIVE: \u0027If Donda was alive he wouldn\u0027t be married to...Jay-Z insists he WASN\u0027T dissing Kanye West over his Trump...\u0027Congrats on influencing all your fans\u0027: Shock as teetotal...Share this article\u0027When we got to Thailand we visited Bangkok first. Kanye went right along to the red-light district with me. From there it was on to Koh Samui. The beaches there are some of the most beautiful in the world. \u0027I was totally embarrassed, though, when one of the professors (also a Catholic priest) asked Kanye what was the favorite part of his holiday. Kanye answered: \u0027\u0027The nude beaches in Thailand\u0027\u0027.\u0027But this is nothing compared to the revelations that Donda reveals about West\u0027s sexual habits when he was approaching his teenage years.She wrote: \u0027I talked with him about it, like I talked with him about everything. There was no topic that was off limits, not even sex. When he was twelve, that conversation came up.\u0027It was my time to car pool and Kanye was in the car along with two of his friends. Jocelyn Elders came on the radio and, as I remember it, she was talking about the rise of teenage pregnancy.\u0027  Blakeley said: \u0027He was a little boy, preschool. He was off the scale. One time, someone asked him when they were looking at his drawings: \u0027Do you want to be an artist when you grow up?\u0027 He said: \u0027I am an artist\u0027. The ego\u0027s always been there!\u0027          Donda revealed in her book that she encouraged Kanye to masturbate rather than having sex with girlfriends at a young age. She added: \u0027I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so\u0027Donda continues in the book: \u0027That\u0027s when I told Kanye and his friends that masturbation was a far better alternative to having sex at such a young age.  \u0027I told them it was perfectly healthy, normal, and gratifying and that they did not have to participate in sex with another partner and risk some young lady getting pregnant or contracting a venereal disease, not the least of which was AIDS. They said nothing.\u0027They just sat there anxious for us to get to school I\u0027m sure, so they could get out of that car. I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so.\u0027After coming back from China, the pair moved home several times.          Blakeley had a special relationship with West, Donda revealed in her 2007 biography, Raising Kanye, which was published just before she diedThe star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247.Donda reveals: \u0027Kanye spent hours and hours mixing, rapping, and writing. It was nonstop. He became so involved that his socializing revolved around that studio in his room.\u0027That thumping bass line seemed to shake the very foundation of our house. Boom-boom-boom day and night. There were all sorts of people coming in and out of the house. \u0027Mainly it was the thundering bass that was no longer welcome—not all day and all night, anyway. I finally had to say to Kanye: \u0027You\u0027re moving\u0027.\u0027Another of his former homes, a tiny, rundown apartment on Lake Bluff Drive, Tinley Park, is where West saw the apparition of Christ - Yeezus meets Jesus!Donda reveals: \u0027One day Kanye was playing in the dining room of our first home in Chicago, a third-floor apartment on the South Side. \u0027All of a sudden, he looked toward the door and the staircase leading down. He pointed and said, \u0027Look, there goes Jesus!\u0027 My heart raced. I saw energy.           Blakeley watched Kanye grow up from the age of three to 11 and even bought Donda and Kanye their first home on South Shore Drive in Chicago (pictured)  The house was meant to be turned into a community center for the youth, but arguments between a charity named after Donda and Kanye means it hasn\u0027t happened yet\u0027To this day, I believe it was Christ giving us just a little extra protection that day. Neither Kanye nor I have spoken of it since.\u0027But it was very real to me and just one of the reasons I think Kanye is connected in a special way or for a special purpose. God has chosen him to not only reach but also touch millions.\u0027 Kanye\u0027s first job was as a busboy collecting plates at the American diner chain Bob Evans.Although, according to Donda, \u0027he decided immediately that bussing tables was not something that would work for him. He quit on his first day before he even started.\u0027When West finally broke onto the music scene, he moved to New York, where he found an apartment at the Hudson Tea Building, in New Jersey, directly across the river from Manhattan, as can be seen in our images.\u0027We rented it, sight unseen. It was $850 a month, with a living room and a step-up great room with a glass ceiling. You could actually look up and see the sky. It was wonderful. And Kanye was inspired...\u0027Kanye loved that place. He called up his friends and said, \u0027Man, you should see this place. It\u0027s like something off of TV.\u0027 Kanye was exactly where he wanted to be. He was on his way to fulfilling his dream,\u0027 says Donda in her book.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Pippa Middleton arrives charity carol service London Meghan expected address","story":"Command attention like Meghan in a military coat by MackageBuy it here now!The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped out for a Christmas carol service this evening.

It is pictured today     Meghan (pictured in London on November 19) has been having secret briefings with a number of organisations, including CAMFED – the Campaign for Female EducationBy Rebecca English, Royal CorrespondentThe Duchess of Sussex is to put education for women in developing countries at the heart of her public work, when she announces her first royal patronages next year, Mail Online can reveal.Meghan, 37, has been having secret briefings with a number of organisations, including CAMFED – the Campaign for Female Education – which works in several African countries, including Zambia, which was visited by Prince Harry last week.It is understood that she and Harry are keen to work together on the issue in their role as roving Commonwealth youth ambassadors.Meghan is a passionate advocate of the work of charity CAMFED, which believes one of the best way to alleviate poverty and inequality is through education. It has already affected the lives of nearly three million girls and young women across sub-Saharan Africa.Its CEO, Lucy Lake, who was with the sixth in line to the throne in Zambia, revealed to the Mail that she had briefed his wife privately at Kensington Palace earlier this year about their work in the country, as well as Zimbabwe, Ghana, Tanzania and Malawi.The Duchess was also met with Zimbabwean-born Angeline Murimirwa, one of the first girls to go to secondary school with the organisation\u0027s support and is now its African executive director. She was named last year as one of the BBC\u0027s 100 most inspirational women.Lucy said: \u0027We had the opportunity to meet with the Duchess in the spring. As an organisation our team very much represents what we are working towards and that was why the Duchess was interested to meet with us and hear more about that.\u0027The way both she and her husband have spoken about these issues in such a thoughtful and discerning manner has really helped the wider movement. It\u0027s exciting times.\u0027We have been working for 25 years supporting girls through education and enabling those young women to make the transition in their communities into positions of leadership, to turn around and support the next generation.\u0027It\u0027s wonderful that the Royal Family is engaging with the issue in this way. For the young people in Zambia to feel that Prince Harry was on a level with them and genuinely interested in what they are doing, left them very inspired and motivated, as was he. That\u0027s a very powerful force. \u0027            It is understood that she and Harry (seen at their wedding on May 19) are keen to work together on the issue in their role as roving Commonwealth youth ambassadorsIt is hoped that the pregnant duchess will be able to travel out to Africa and see CAMFED\u0027s work for herself after she has had her baby next spring.Royal sources say the duchess has been having meetings with a number of organisations and is still finalising which areas to work in and what charities to support as she moves on with her public work.It is understood that she is particularly keen to support issues where she can work alongside her husband.Aides hope to make an announcement about her first patronages in the new year, eight months after she joined the Royal Family.Although it is considered quite a long time to wait before announcing her patronages, it is understood that Meghan wishes to \u0027really get to know\u0027 the organisations she wants to work with in order to make a \u0027real and lasting\u0027 difference.                           "},{"url":null,"title":"Black Panther poised Oscars heavyweight","story":"All of this year\u0027s contenders have by now screened, and Oscar prognosticators generally have \u0027Black Panther\u0027 in, comfortably, as a best picture nominee As Hollywood\u0027s awards season properly gets under way, \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is poised to return to the Academy Awards, but this time as a nominee - and potentially a major one. Ryan Coogler\u0027s superhero sensation has already notched countless records, pulverized box-office myths and set new marks for inclusivity. And now, \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is in line to shatter Oscar norms, too.All of this year\u0027s contenders have by now screened, and Oscar prognosticators generally have \u0027Black Panther\u0027 in, comfortably, as a best picture nominee.

Jordan\u0027s performanceMuch is still in flux in the Oscar race ahead of Thursday morning\u0027s Golden Globes nominations. But unless something drastic happens, \u0027Black Panther\u0027 will next month become the first comic book film to be nominated for best picture and easily Marvel Studios\u0027 most significant Oscar contender ever.That\u0027s very good news for ABC\u0027s Feb. 24 telecast which is coming off an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers. Some 55.2 million watched \u0027Titanic\u0027 sweep the 1997 Oscars, and producers have long harbored dreams of another big-tent blockbuster pulling viewers to a broadcast increasingly dominated by independent films like \u0027The Shape of Water,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Moonlight\u0027 and \u0027Spotlight.\u0027 Usually, bigger movies mean bigger ratings.For the makers of \u0027Black Panther,\u0027 it\u0027s a new chapter for a film - with more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the third-highest all-time domestic gross and the biggest box-office hit ever directed by a black man - that has already filled record books. What does Coogler think of \u0027Black Panther\u0027 as an Oscar movie?\u0027Fortunately, I don\u0027t have to think about it that much,\u0027 the 32-year-old filmmaker of \u0027Fruitvale Station\u0027 and \u0027Creed\u0027 said in an interview. \u0027I\u0027ve grown to have close relationships with my collaborators, so I care about the crafts people who work on the film and the actors who work on the film. Because of those relationships, I\u0027m happy when they\u0027re happy. It\u0027s always nice when people are recognized for their work. But beyond that, I really don\u0027t worry about it.\u0027 The film is also in the running for Ruth Carter\u0027s costume design, the cinematography of Rachel Morrison and Hannah Beachler\u0027s production designYet few films will be watched more closely through awards season than \u0027Black Panther,\u0027 which is also in the running for Ruth Carter\u0027s costume design, the cinematography of Rachel Morrison (who last year became the first woman ever nominated in the category), Hannah Beachler\u0027s production design, Coogler\u0027s direction, the script by Joe Robert Cole and Coogler, Kendrick Lamar\u0027s song \u0027All the Stars\u0027 and Michael B. Jordan\u0027s supporting performance.\u0027Black Panther\u0027 has already been at the center of the uproar over the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u0027 short-lived plans to institute a \u0027best popular film\u0027 category. The academy\u0027s move was intended to rope in more box-office hits to the broadcast, but critics said such a category would potentially ghettoize films like \u0027Black Panther\u0027 from the prestigious honor of best picture. (Coogler declined to address the category\u0027s scuttling.)While superhero films have dominated multiplexes for the last decade, the Oscars have been famously resistant to them. Ten years ago, \u0027The Dark Knight\u0027 earned eight nominations but missed out on best picture, prompting the film academy to expand the category the following year.   Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting a connection to the film, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did\u0027          With more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the film has the third-highest all-time domestic grossMany of the academy\u0027s members resent how superheroes have come to dominate the industry, but there have been some signs lately that anti-Marvel sentiment is ebbing. Last year, while \u0027Wonder Woman\u0027 failed to earn a nod, the Wolverine sequel \u0027Logan\u0027 became the first superhero film nominated for best adapted screenplay . This year, best animated film may also be a superhero battle, with \u0027Incredibles 2\u0027 and \u0027Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u0027 among the favorites.But the awards campaign for \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is predicated less on its superhero DNA than on its cultural impact and on its personal nature as, despite its budget, an auteur film by one of the most widely respected young filmmakers in Hollywood. \u0027Black Panther\u0027 last week for a day played for free in arthouse theaters nationwide in an event put on by Art House Convergence and Film Comment.George H.W. Bush\u0027s service dog Sully visits his casket in...Grateful George W. and Laura Bush make a surprise visit to...Share this articleFor Coogler, making \u0027Black Panther\u0027 couldn\u0027t be more personal. It was a journey in finding his own connection to Africa. While developing the script, he visited South Africa, Kenya and the Kingdom of Lesotho - a tiny nation that inspired Coogler\u0027s Wakanda.\u0027In simple terms, the film is what brought me to the continent,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027It was kind of a lifelong thing just to get there and see it. The thing that I found was a sense of identity as an African person. I found in those trips and through that research a definition for myself of what it means to be African. That was a question I was seeking as a filmmaker.\u0027Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting that connection, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did.\u0027\u0027Black Panther\u0027 arrived to feverish enthusiasm and debuted in the most resplendent and regal Hollywood premiere of the decade. It has been called \u0027a defining moment for Black America,\u0027 pop-culture myth-making at its best and the best big-budget studio epic in ages. Parents took their kids and kids took their parents in a groundbreaking generational event. Theaters were rented out. It was the No. 1 film at the U.S. box office for five straight weeks.\u0027We always saw it as a film to watch with your loved ones, with your friends and with strangers, in communal settings,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027People are still interested in doing that and it feels fortunate.\u0027In a year where Netflix has a formidable Oscar contender in Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s \u0027Roma,\u0027 and fears of the diminishing of the theatrical experience pervade the industry, that may be the most appealing reason for academy members to vote for \u0027Black Panther\u0027: It proved the still-vibrant, earth-shattering power of the movie theater.

Pictured: Yoko in the studio with the Beatles (pictured in 1969)          But by 1972, the \u0027dazzle had gone out of their lives\u0027. The only way out Yoko could see was to get John a mistress and she set up the relationship with May Pang, 22, (pictured with John in the 1970s) a beautiful Chinese girl who had been working for the coupleTheir relationship would lead to suffocation for John and he talked of orce while Yoko had found her métier running the iconic British band\u0027s empire.\u0027Her detractors, however, and there are many, point to some clever plotting and attention-seeking behavior on her behalf\u0027, writes Connolly. \u0027A little-known avant-garde artist who was wishing to make a name for herself in a new country could do no better than by finding a way of association with the Beatles, and especially John Lennon, whose every action was newsworthy and was now rich enough to be a very important person\u0027.The Beatles lived in a feel-good party bubble for two years after finishing their first North American tour in the summer of 1964.           Author Ray Connolly writes in Being John Lennon: A Restless Life that Yoko found a way to make a name for herself through John Lennon was already taking Preludin, an amphetamine, to keep up the intense booking schedule, as well as drinking alcohol.When Bob Dylan introduced the band to marijuana, consumption quickly progressed to smoking it for breakfast.LSD became John\u0027s next drug of choice and he took acid while reading a book by Timothy Leary about destroying your ego.Lennon\u0027s drug habits caused him to start panicking about death threats to the group, who were then confined to their hotel while touring.When crowds started spitting at them, the band decided it was time to \u0027give rock a rest.\u0027\u0027It was f***ing humiliation,\u0027 John said. \u0027One has to completely humiliate oneself to be what the Beatles were.\u0027The whole Beatle thing was just beyond comprehension. I was eating and drinking like a pig, and I was as fat as a pig\u0027.\u0027The Ku Klux Klan had nailed Beatles albums to burning crosses and radio stations began to ban the playing of Beatles records,\u0027 writes the author.\u0027To John, ever dissatisfied with the way things were, the idea of a spiritual rebirth, a starting again, was always attractive\u0027.The group went their separate ways - George went to India, Paul composed music for a movie, Ringo took a holiday and John went to Spain before returning to London.          The Beatles (above in 1965) lived in a feel-good party bubble for two years after making their first North American tour in summer of 1964. Lennon was already taking Preludin, an amphetamine, to keep up the intense booking schedule, as well as drinking alcohol          Yoko, a heroin addict, turned up in Lennon\u0027s (pictured in 1969) life during a time when he was seeking a spiritual rebirth and turned him onto her drug of choice, and she would eventually be instrumental in breaking up the BeatlesEnter Yoko Ono, who always claimed that their meeting at the Indica Gallery in London was \u0027purely by accident\u0027.John had been dropped off at the gallery by owner John Dunbar. He viewed the art as a con and suspected that he was being hustled to buy something.Downstairs he was introduced to \u0027a very small Japanese lady wearing a black sweater and black trousers, peering out from between two curtain folds of long black hair\u0027.She was preparing her exhibition opening the following day and was in London with her current husband and child, Kyoko.Yoko claimed she hadn\u0027t recognized John \u0027although she had insisted to Dunbar that a Beatle be invited\u0027, writes the author.One of her art pieces was a board with a chain and a hammer hanging on it and a bunch of nails at the bottom.John asked: \u0027Can I hammer a nail in it\u0027? \u0027No\u0027, she said and walked away.She came back and asked for five shillings. Lennon had no money on him and said he would give her five imaginary shillings to hammer in an imaginary nail.She later contacted Lennon and asked him for an original music score for a short film. He sent lyrics to one of the Beatles\u0027 songs but John didn\u0027t know that she had initially asked Paul who refused her request.\u0027Yoko had broken into the orbit of the Beatles\u0027, writes the author.A few weeks after the Indica Gallery meeting, she showed up at the Beatles\u0027 office in Mayfair hoping to speak to John.She wanted financial backing to wrap the statues of the lions in Trafalgar Square in canvas.          Yoko had John finance her art project that featured a room that had half of every object. Pictured: Yoko sitting in her \u0027half bedroom\u0027 in 1968          Yoko has always claimed that she met John at the Indica Gallery in London \u0027purely by accident\u0027. Yoko claimed she hadn\u0027t recognized John \u0027although she had insisted to Dunbar that a Beatle be invited\u0027, writes the author. Pictured: The couple in 1971In John\u0027s absence, she pitched the idea to Ringo who was \u0027non plussed --- and commented she might just as well have been speaking in Japanese for the little he understood of her plan\u0027.\u0027From the very beginning of her career, she understood the power of networking and self-promotion especially self-promotion,\u0027 according to Connolly, a veteran journalist and screenwriter who John befriended in the late 1960s.Yoko\u0027s next move was to send John a copy of her self-published book of \u0027instructional poems\u0027 called Grapefruit.One poem was: \u0027Stir inside of your brains with a penis until things are mixed up. Take a walk. Smoke everything you can, including your pubic hair\u0027.John \u0027felt that she was the star and he the audience\u0027.He hadn\u0027t felt that for a long time. She was an enigma to him. Never had he met anyone like this \u0027odd little Japanese woman dressed in her black intellectual\u0027s uniform,\u0027 writes the author.In the summer of 1967, the Sgt. Pepper album was released, while John was still high on LSD and feeling \u0027needles of jealousy\u0027 towards Paul for his clever songwriting.Beatles manager Brian Epstein was dead of an accidental overdose of sleeping pills, leaving John feeling guilty having introduced his old friend to pills.John knew years earlier that Epstein, openly gay, had fallen in love with him. It made John question his own sexuality and he once let Brian pleasure him him but then he later turned on him and called him a \u0027queer Jew\u0027. Throughout all of this, Yoko was writing letters to John, getting under his skin and suddenly was everywhere he was.She even showed up at a meeting that John, Paul and Jane Asher had with a yogi in the Indian Himalayas.          Throughout all of this, Yoko was writing letters to John (pictured in 1969), getting under his skin and suddenly was everywhere he was. She even showed up at a meeting that Paul and Jane Asher had with a yogi in the Indian HimalayasYoko wrote John multiple times a week while he was in India. He collected the letters at the post office so his wife, Cynthia, would be none the wiser.Yoko never quit the chase and John made up his mind to orce Cynthia, his high school Brigitte Bardot fantasy, and leave his wife and child for Yoko. Yoko, seven years John\u0027s senior, was born in Tokyo, her father a wealthy banker and a Christian, her mother a Buddhist. When her father was posted to a position in the U.S. and the family moved to Scarsdale, New York, Yoko enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers but dropped out after meeting a Japanese composer, Toshi Ichiyanagi, studying at the Julliard School, a performing arts conservatory.They were married and with little money, Yoko waitressed to support her bohemian lifestyle and her conceptualist art.\u0027If she received any reviews at all, they were usually critical, but criticism and rejection never stopped her\u0027, writes the author. \u0027Her belief in herself was total\u0027.She had affairs during that short-lived marriage and the couple separated with Yoko returning to Japan and putting on one of her conceptual art \u0027events\u0027.Failing to ignite any excitement, she was institutionalized by her husband and family after overdosing on sleeping pills.American filmmaker, Tony Cox pursued Yoko in Japan and helped her get out of the hospital. She got pregnant, quickly orced Toshi and married Cox.Cox delivered the baby at home and continued to do most of the childcare for their daughter. When fame eluded Yoko in Japan, she returned to New York.          Yoko, seven years John\u0027s senior, was born in Tokyo, her father a wealthy banker and a Christian, her mother a Buddhist. When her father was posted to a position in the U.S. and the family moved to Scarsdale, New York.

There were no reviews.Invited to appear at a symposium in London, she reconnected with John who \u0027finally found someone who was balmy as I am\u0027, John told his friend Pete Shotton.Yoko and John became a couple and a brand -- JohnandYoko -- and the \u0027poisoned dwarf\u0027 finally got her wish. \u0027She was becoming famous\u0027.They were never apart for the next three years before moving to Manhattan in 1971.With Yoko, he was no longer the front man as he was with the Beatles and never away from her side.Ronnie Spector, 75, reveals the moment her \u0027abusive\u0027...Tantalising secrets of The Beatles buried in the White...John Lennon\u0027s killer reveals he purposely used hollow...Share this articleThey dressed in matching white suits and both parted their long hair down the middle. John insisted that Yoko be at all recording sessions –inhibiting to the other Beatles and helped escalate the final demise of the band.Yoko had already expressed she didn\u0027t like rock and roll music and viewed it as culturally crude. She made suggestions in a field she knew nothing about.She was staging her own \u0027events\u0027 that critics viewed as \u0027Yoko\u0027s vanity projects that John was funding. Interest in them was low to non-existent,\u0027 writes the author.John sued Cynthia for orce citing adultery, a charge later withdrawn and reversed to John\u0027s uncontested adultery.Now he could marry Yoko but she was still married to Cox who had originally encouraged Yoko to pursue John as an art patron and she owed him a lot of money.          Inseparable, John insisted that Yoko be at all recording sessions –inhibiting to the other Beatles and helped escalate the final demise of the band. Pictured: John and Yoko in one of the last photos of John before he was shot dead in 1980 \u0027He got her out of the mental hospital in Japan, he kept her going, raised money for her shows...went after all the publicity, found backers for her films, borrowed money from banks...\u0027 writes the author, and now she was dumping him for someone rich and famous.John was blinded by Yoko and saw her as the most intelligent woman he had ever met as well as being very beautiful.The workforce at Apple Records didn\u0027t like Yoko and remembered her as \u0027a very pushy broad with not an ounce of humble in her\u0027.Mimi, John\u0027s aunt, told a reporter, \u0027I didn\u0027t like the look of her from the start\u0027. \u0027My God, what\u0027s that?\u0027 she said on first sight and dubbed her \u0027the poisoned dwarf\u0027.Little did Mimi know at the time that Yoko introduced heroin to John who began sniffing it regularly. John and Yoko were busted for hash, traces of marijuana and half a gram of morphine. John\u0027s own arrest didn\u0027t phase him. \u0027I was stoned all the time and just didn\u0027t give a s**t\u0027, he told Connelly.He was so stoned, he no longer cared about the once magical writing relationship with McCartney.While John was \u0027lost in the glow of love\u0027, he never recognized that Yoko was generating ill from fans and the general public who hated her music.          While John was \u0027lost in the glow of love\u0027, he never recognized that Yoko was generating ill from fans and the general public who hated her music. Neither did the other Beatles who wanted to get the group back to being only four          After Yoko gave her blessing to May and John (pictured together in 1974), the pair escaped to Los Angeles and stayed together for eighteen months. Yoko phoned John a dozen times a day still high on heroinThey just didn\u0027t like her – and neither did the other Beatles who wanted to get the group back to being only four. \u0027I think you\u0027re both nuts, the pair of you\u0027, Ringo told John.Yoko had driven a wedge between John and Paul as well as into the management battle and the new agent asking for a larger percentage.Life at the Dakota apartment building on Manhattan\u0027s Upper West Side where the couple lived turned into suffocation for the Beatle. John spent hours sleeping or staring mutely at the TV.\u0027The dazzle had gone out of their lives\u0027, writes the author. The myth of perfect love evaporated by 1972.The only way out Yoko could see was to get John a mistress and she set up the relationship with May Pang, 22, a beautiful Chinese girl who had been working for the couple.The pair escaped to Los Angeles and stayed together for eighteen months.Yoko phoned John a dozen times a day.John was now happier than he had been in years --- until Yoko rang saying she had found a cure for John\u0027s cigarette smoking – hypnotism and that could only take place at the Dakota.May wasn\u0027t invited to the session and off John went in January 1975.John never revealed what transpired during the session but he became quite ill and the author suggests some kind of aversion therapy transpired.John saw May on the sly but he was back in the grip of Yoko.          \u0027She was more than a wife to him. She was more like a mother. \u0027Perhaps that was why he began to call her Mother\u0027. Pictured: John and Yoko in November of 1980 \u0027She had needed him for his fame and the cachet it gave her, for his money and the limousines. She made him feel clever and not just a rock and roller. Now as she ran the Dakota apartment and staff, and sat in his place on the Apple board, she seemed to offer to bring order to his life\u0027, writes Connolly.\u0027She was more than a wife to him. She was more like a mother. \u0027Perhaps that was why he began to call her Mother\u0027.She took control of all of John\u0027s finances and became his manager.But his muse was dried up and for the next four years, John was rarely seen in public.He had nowhere to go, no one to see and spent time watching Dumbo cartoons with their young son, Sean.He became anorexic thin and was sure that the FBI was listening in on all his calls. No calls from friends were put through to him. \u0027Yoko has him all locked up\u0027, Mick Jagger said.\u0027Yoko had found her métier in life – she ran the busy Lennon empire\u0027 – according to whether or not Mercury was in retrograde.Lennon\u0027s days were spent living on the fringes of \u0027a world that Yoko was running without him\u0027.It was only when John went on a stormy sailing trip from Cape Town, South Africa to Bermuda that he regained his self-confidence and sense of self-worth.On his return he was ready to write and record again. But it wasn\u0027t to be.John was shot dead by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980 outside of the Dakota.Thirty-eighty years after the crime, Chapman remains in Attica State Prison. Ray Connolly\u0027s Being John Lennon: A Restless Life is available here. "},{"url":null,"title":"Cuba begin internet access mobile phones","story":"Youths use a password protected wifi network coming from a five star hotel to surf the Internet on their smart phones in downtown Havana, Cuba (stock image)The communist-governed island has one of the world\u0027s lowest rates of internet use but that has been expanding rapidly since Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro declared detente in 2014.

But Craig had no idea what they looked likeOne user revealed she met her girlfriend of six years in the exact same way.Craig told DailyMail.com the online reaction was \u0027unexpected\u0027. He said: \u0027I thought I\u0027d post the picture, my friends and I would laugh a bit, and that would be it.\u0027After high interest in whether he would pick the woman or man, Craig shared that he \u0027texted the bottom number\u0027 on Saturday, sparking delight across social media as he revealed he was interested in men.Keeping followers updated on their plans to see a movie and have a sushi dinner, as well as confiding in well-wishers about how nervous he was, Craig, who is a Computer Science  Pre-Medicine student at the University of Utah, finally shared a pic of Forbes.          Twitter users responded with excitement although Craig told DailyMail.com he did get some homophobic comments          Twitter users wanted both friends to end up with a date for showing initiativeHe told those eager to get more details how he had an amazing time and a second date was already penciled in for Wednesday evening.But what many Twitter users didn\u0027t know was that Craig hadn\u0027t even glimpsed the people who were keen to date him.\u0027A co-worker gave it to me from him! I didn\u0027t see him at all!,\u0027 he revealed to DailyMail.com in the hours before his second date.Overall Craig has been pleased with the online support, although his post was stolen by some other social media users who tried to pass it as their own.He also did get some negative feedback in the form of gay slurs and homophobia.The student said that in the past six years of being actively involved in the gay community on Twitter he is used to receiving \u0027occasional hate\u0027.          Craig revealed that he had chosen to contact \u0027the bottom number\u0027 and tweeted in the lead up to his first date Sunday\u0027There\u0027s definitely been negative comments here and there, but I think people are reporting them and getting them removed or hidden, which is great because a lot of platforms are struggling to deal with harassment and hate speech right now,\u0027 Craig added.But the reaction that meant more to Craig was that of his family. As the post gained interest he shared it with his mother who he told Twitter users \u0027seems to be handling it okay…\u0027She had already found out about the viral sensation from Craig\u0027s teenage siblings and although she was aware her son is gay, it\u0027s something they haven\u0027t been open discussing since he first told his parents.\u0027I came out to my parents a while ago,\u0027 he told DailyMail.com. \u0027It didn\u0027t go terrible or great, and we don\u0027t really talk about it. So I\u0027m kinda still coming out to them forever it feels like.\u0027           Craig (left) shared that the date went well revealed the identity of his new love interest           The pair will go on the second date Wednesday night and Craig hopes to meet his friend Klumpp soonIt\u0027s unclear whether his dad has seen the story around.He added: \u0027I\u0027d assume so, since my siblings show them most of the memes they find.\u0027And for those asking him online if he planned on showing the girl involved any attention, Craig told Dailymail.com she reached out to him on Instagram Tuesday night and was \u0027excited\u0027 for her friend and his new love interest.Revealing her identity as Janae Klumpp, he added that they may even find a friendship of their own.Craig added: \u0027We both have been involved with a cappella, so I definitely want to hang out with her!\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Luxembourg PM Bettel begins second term coalition government","story":"Luxembourg is set make all of its public transport free in a world first, it has emerged.

She said she passed out and the next morning thought she\u0027d had a stroke          The shocking footage shows her appear to lose consciousness then collapse on the floor behind the bar           She appears to be out cold on the ground as fellow party-goers gather around to see if she is ok. Afterwards Miss Phillips said she felt forced to quit the pub where Mr Webb still works   The alleged incident took place at the Cameo Club in Roath, Cardiff (pictured) where Miss Phillips and Mr Webb both worked at the timeBar manager, 24, who thought she had suffered a stroke...Flybe pilot who was fired after developing a fear of flying...Share this articleAnd today the footage was played at an employment tribunal, which ruled in Miss Phillips\u0027 favour that she was unfairly dismissed when bosses failed to properly investigate her complaint that she was strangled at the party.She told the court she suffered such serious facial paralysis that she may never be able to smile properly again.The Cameo Club had its last Christmas party on New Years Day but the morning after the bash, she woke up and noticed she had slight facial palsy but was baffled as to why.Fearing she was having a stroke, she went to the doctors but was told her injuries were \u0027either caused by lack of oxygen or nerve damage\u0027.Returning to work, she viewed the CCTV to find out what had gone on and saw Webb appear to choke her.The tribunal heard that burly Mr Webb was arrested over the incident but released under investigation and remained employed by the Cameo Club after the incident.He is still employed by the bar.           Ms Phillips, who had no recollection of what happened, went to hospital the following day fearing she had had a stroke after after sending her mum a photo of her sloping mouth           Mr Webb can be seen on the CCTV leaning over after he appears to throttle the bar manager at the staff Christmas party in CardiffMs Phillips initially returned to work after the incident and told bosses she did not want to take any action.But as time went, she became increasingly distrustful and fearful of WebbAt the same time, medics were telling her that the injuries she suffered would have longer lasting effects than previously thought.Yet when she raised these concerns with the directors of the company, she was told to get over it and ultimately felt she had no choice but to quit.In her judgement following the tribunal, judge Alison Frazer was heavily critical of the Cameo\u0027s directors for failing to take her concerns seriously.She said: \u0027The fact was the CCTV evidence showed that Mr Webb had her in a hold which caused her to fall to the floor.\u0027It was only open to the Respondent to take a view as to what action was appropriate after it had impartially gathered the facts via an investigation.\u0027I find that from April onwards Mr Davies acted in a way which was dismissive of the Claimant\u0027s feelings about the incident. He told her to \u0027get over it\u0027 when referring to the Christmas party incident.\u0027          Ms Phillips (pictured) told how she passed out after chef Mr Webb gripped her neck at a Christmas party  Miss Phillips said she told firm bosses Huw Davies (pictured left at Cardiff magistrates courthouse) and Jason Pearce (right) of the attack, but her complaints were not taken seriouslySince the incident, Ms Phillips says that as well as her partial facial paralysis, she suffers from PTSD, anxiety and depression.She added: \u0027I can\u0027t smile in photographs.\u0027People don\u0027t notice it, but I notice it more than anything.\u0027If it\u0027s still like that when I get married, I won\u0027t be able to smile in my wedding photos. Things like that. It\u0027s not nice.\u0027But she said the worst bit was the fact her bosses didn\u0027t do anything.She continued: \u0027I\u0027d worked there for two and half years and done everything to that place and it was just like, I realised I meant nothing to them and I was completely disposable.\u0027In her evidence at the employment tribunal at Cardiff Magistrates Court in November, she claimed the club\u0027s company director, Jason Pearce, was heard joking about the incident with Mr Webb.She also told the hearing that after other alleged behaviour by Mr Webb including putting chilli in a staff member\u0027s soup and threatening someone on a night out, she told her employers she had begun lose faith in their ability \u0027to keep her safe in her workplace\u0027.She claimed she was told in one meeting on April 4 by another director Huw Davies to just \u0027get over it\u0027, and was told the same comment again on April 18.In her written judgement, Judge Frazer criticised the directors for not fully investigating at this stage.She wrote: \u0027She was able to carry on at work without suffering any real psychological effects, working alongside Mr Webb, until March.\u0027In March the Claimant observed two incidents that made her perceive the Christmas party incident in a different way.\u0027Rightly or wrongly, she formed the view from these incidents that he had the capacity to be violent towards women. This made her believe that she had been the victim of insidious violence at the hands of Mr Webb.\u0027Around this time, she also learnt that her facial paralysis was more permanent than initially anticipated. I find that this culminated in her feeling vulnerable around Mr Webb in the workplace.            Miss Phillips has won her case against the company for unfair dismissal at the employment tribunal and has submitted a personal injury claim. She told the hearing that she felt that she was forced to quit \u0027In my finding there was an inextricable link between the incident at the Christmas party and the workplace, even though it had happened off duty. It was a works Christmas party held on site.\u0027She also criticised the directors for their response to the CCTV footage.She said: \u0027Mr Pearce understood from observation of the CCTV that the Claimant had been strangled.\u0027Mr Davies, on the other hand, denied that this was the case. Mr Pearce did not watch the video until April or May and Mr Davies only watched it once.\u0027The judge concluded that because of their actions - and the actions of another person brought in to hear a grievance that Ms Phillips raised - she was justified in resigning and was \u0027constructively unfairly dismissed.\u0027Afterwards Ms Phillips said she had a \u0027sense of relief\u0027 adding: \u0027It just feels like a weight lifted,\u0027 she added. \u0027I don\u0027t want to think about it anymore.\u0027Cameo Club declined to comment while South Wales Police said: \u0027A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and he is currently released under investigation.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Shocking extent big firms harvest data","story":"    Emails detailing how Facebook accepted cash in exchange for access to its users\u0027 data were published by Parliament last night. The firm\u0027s staff discuss whitelisting companies including AirBnB, Tinder and Netflix – allowing them to retain access to Facebook user data if they placed enough advertising. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u0027s chief executive, wrote in a private email that access to user data could be licensed to advertising buyers. But he adds: \u0027If the revenue we get from those doesn\u0027t add up to more than the fees you owe us, then you just pay us the fee directly.\u0027               The hotel chain faces investigations from the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office in the UK, as well as the FBI and five separate American states. Marriott International is one of a dozen companies investigated by the Mail to assess the full scope of the data taken from customers – details of which are buried within thousands of words of legal jargon. Last night a spokesman from the ICO said its enforcement team was examining the material we provided.

Secretary brands no deal Brexit crazy senior MPs summoned secret briefings","story":"    Chancellor Philip Hammond told MPs during the latest stage of debate on Theresa May\u0027s deal that he does not \u0027believe we can afford the economic costs of a no deal Brexit\u0027          Business Secretary Greg Clark (pictured today) said failing to reach agreement with the EU would risk \u0027destroying\u0027 crucial parts of the economyBrexiteers slammed the sessions at the Civil Contingencies unite as an attempt to \u0027spook\u0027 opponents of Mrs May\u0027s plan, and insisted no-one would be fooled by them.  But in an interview on Sky News this morning, Mr Clark said crashing out would cause massive damage to manufacturing and trade across the Channel.He said it would \u0027destroy the foundation of the success of some of our most brilliant industries\u0027. \u0027It would be crazy to disrupt at a time of great prosperity for some of these industries,\u0027 he said. Opening the third day of debate on the deal, Mr Hammond said: \u0027I have observed this process at close quarters for two-and-a-half years and I\u0027m absolutely clear about one thing, this deal is the best deal to exit the EU that is available or that is going to be available.\u0027The idea that there\u0027s an option of renegotiating at the 11th hour is simply a delusion.\u0027We need to be honest with ourselves, the alternatives to this deal are no deal or no Brexit.\u0027Either will leave us a fractured society and a ided nation.\u0027\u0027Only that compromise can bring us back

restrictions on our citizens travelling in Europe, nothing except being the only developed economy in the world trading with the EU on purely WTO terms with no customs facilitation agreements, no data sharing and protection agreements, no approvals regime to allow our industries to trade with their nearest customers and suppliers.\u0027Mr Hammond warned car exporters would face tariffs of 10 per cent, clothing exporters would face 12 per cent and agricultural exporters would face \u0027even higher tariffs\u0027 than that.He said: \u0027The fact is our economic and trading relationship with the EU has been built over 45 years and during that time our economies have shaped themselves around each other and become inextricably intertwined, supply chains crisscross borders, work forces draw on talent from across the continent.\u0027\u0027While new trade partnerships with countries outside the EU undoubtedly offer new and exciting opportunities for UK companies, the analysis the Government published last week is clear that the benefits flowing from new FTAs would not compensate for the loss of EU trade from a no-deal exit\u0027, he added.Meanwhile, Thames Water has warned of a no-deal Brexit threat to clean water and confirmed talks with the Government to safeguard supplies.Chief executive Steve Robertson said the group is \u0027working closely\u0027 with the department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as the industry tries to ensure it has enough supplies of chemicals to treat drinking water.He said the ability to stockpile many of the chemicals was limited, as many need to be refrigerated.He stressed there would not be a water shortage, but said the industry was having to take action and might need to call on the Government for back-up support on certain supplies.Mr Robertson said: \u0027There\u0027s no need for panic, but we do need to recognise there\u0027s a threat from the point of view of supply of chemicals.\u0027It may be that we need some support from the Government.\u0027He added that the industry is putting in place no-deal contingency plans by maximising storage of chemicals where possible, with firms also planning to \u0027mutually support\u0027 each other.It comes after reports suggested that Environment Secretary Michael Gove opted to back Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal amid fears over clean water supplies in a no-deal scenario, although he has since given assurances that water will be safe.A senior source on the Tory Eurosceptic ERG group of MPs said the Cabinet Office briefings for MPs were

A new use for the building was found in 1892 when it opened as the National Gallery of British Art, which today is known as Tate Britain, part of a network of Tate galleries across EnglandIn 1830 Greenwich in south east London was sitting in isolation, miles from the metropolis on a southern bend of the Thames. It housed a small collection of buildings at the time. Today Grenwich has become a sprawling metropolis and the area is known for the National Maritime Museum. Greenwich is also known for its market where books and antiques are soldThe Tower of London and newly built St. Katherine Docks are shown on the map. The tower was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England and is the home of the Crown Jewels. In 1830 the constable of the tower ordered a clearance of several feet of silt which had built up in the moat surrounding the castle over several centuries.

Today it is a bustling financial district and it was much the same in 1830. The City was the world\u0027s primary business centre in the 19th century.  The Port of London in its centre, grew rapidly during the 19th century, with the construction of many docks, needed as the Thames at the City could not cope with the volume of tradeIt is a similar story in the East End of London, where few people lived east of Tower Hamlets other than a small settlement in Hackney and a few areas in the developing Docklands.In the west of the city, where Earl\u0027s Court now stands were fields, while Camden Town, with its docks, was one of the most northern outposts.A collection of buildings at Greenwich in south east London was right on the outskirts of the capital which had yet to become the sprawling metropolis of today.At the time the map was laid out, London\u0027s population was still just around 1.5 million - although this still made it the most heavily populated city in the world.However, as a consequence of the industrial revolution, its population doubled to 3.2million by 1860, and shot up further to 6.7million by 1900.To cope with the increasing population, the East End underwent major development and the open spaces were rapidly filled in in the mid-19th century.The map shows the recently completed Great Surrey Canal, Regent\u0027s Park, St Katharine Docks and the planned development of Belgravia by Thomas Cubitt.At the time the map was published Hyde Park in west London had recently undergone a makeover. It had remained the same for almost 100 years until the 1820s when King George IV ordered a makeover, which saw a monumental entrance at Hyde Park Corner, which is still seen today and the Wellington Arch, which was later moved to the middle of roundabout at Hyde Park Corner. The park\u0027s walls were also replaced with railings and several new lodges and gates were designed. A bridge was also built across the Serpentine lake in the park. The park was also formally split from Kensington Gardens by a new road called West Carriage DriveThe Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is the smallest borough in London and the second smallest district in England. It has many affluent areas such as Notting Hill, Central Kensington, South Kensington and Chelsea. But in 1830, Kensington and Chelsea was just starting to be developed and rather than roads and grand buildings the borough contained many open fields and country lanesMillwall and Stratford was made up of sparsely inhabited marshland north of the Thames at the time the map was first published. Stratford is today East London\u0027s primary retail, cultural and leisure centre. The area is one of the most important business districts in the capital alongside the likes of Canary Wharf. Millwall\u0027s name derives from the windmills that once lined its western embankmentShortly before the map was produced a freshly laid out Regent\u0027s Park was designed as a huge circle with a lake, a canal and the new royal residence inside. For hundreds of years before it was isolated farmland used as a hunting chase. It was further developed 1835 villa was surrounded by trees to make the residents feel they were living in a private estate. Today it is regarded as one of London\u0027s finest park and is well known for its landscaping.  A freshly laid out Regents Park is seen in the map, showing the stables of Camden Lock just to the north and Lords to the westOne of the most interesting buildings is Millbank Prison in Pimlico which opened in 1816 as a holding facility for convicted prisoners before they were transported to Australia. It closed in 1890.Cricket lovers will be able to identify Lords Cricket Ground and The Oval on the map.However, the home of English rugby, Twickenham, and football, Wembley Stadium, were not built until the early 20th century.The opening of Westminster Bridge in 1750 and Blackfrairs Bridge in 1769 encouraged growth in the south west of London in the late 18th and early 19th century.But only Tower Bridge provided access south east of the river, so it grew much more slowly until the Surrey Commercial Docks were built.The map, which carries a dedication to William IV, measures about 4ft by 6ft and uses a scale of 8ins to a mile.Christopher and John Greenwood spent three years preparing the new survey of London before it was published.It has been consigned for sale by a private collector with Dominic Winter auctions of Cirencester, Gloucs, and carries a pre-sale estimate of £5,000.Chris Albury, specialist at Dominic Winter, said: \u0027Large-scale detailed maps of large towns and cities have an instant visual appeal.\u0027Large and colourful maps of London, both modern and antique, are currently very popular and highly in demand.\u0027As a nation we are all familiar with the snaking shape of the Thames in central London as seen on this map, if only from the credits to EastEnders, and it is then impossible not to be drawn into looking at the beautifully depicted and organised details - the roads, green spaces and landmark features.\u0027Westminster Abbey and St Paul\u0027s Cathedral are of course still with us now but one can get lost in the detail looking at the various parishes trying to work out what has gone and what has yet to be built.\u0027The sale takes place on December 12.         "},{"url":null,"title":"Are Britains worst Christmas trees Residents moan towns poor efforts","story":"Residents in Birkenhead have complained about the \u0027scaffold\u0027 Christmas tree put up in the town centreIn Birkenhead, residents described the tree a \u0027waste of space\u0027 that looked like \u0027scaffolding\u0027.   The hollow, cone-shaped metal frame with LED lights was installed in the city centre by the Wirral Chamber of Commerce.The tree, with a solitary Christmas present instead of an Angel or Star on the top of the structure, is meant to symbolise a point of pride for the town which has now become a representation of disappointment.How could an adored mother-of-five simply vanish into thin...From Horrid Henry\u0027s evil plot to kidnap Santa to the...Share this articleLocal residents have insisted that the Wirral Chamber should not have bothered putting the tree up.Elderly resident Robert Williams said: \u0027Is that it?

A group of Cabinet ministers have been mulling it over as a fallback plan. It would effectively keep the UK in the single market, with a customs bolt-on to avoid a hard Irish border, and backers say it would keep Britain close to the EU while cutting contributions to Brussels.However, critics say it has the drawbacks of keeping free movement, - and tightly limiting the possibilities for doing trade deals elsewhere.The EU is also thought to have concerns about a country the UK\u0027s size joining the EEA, while other states in the group might be resistant.  If the Norway model was endorsed by the Commons, it would not be binding on the government.But it would have huge political force, and it might be very difficult for ministers to face down the calls.Mrs May is unlikely to be able to put the policy in place as it break her often-stated red lines.In the end, it might need a new government of national unity, perhaps led by a respected cross-party figure, to put the UK on course for Norway-plus - with the prospect of a general election soon afterwards.   Government faces down Commons revolt and forces through no dealMrs May\u0027s mantra for more than two years was \u0027no deal is better than a bad deal\u0027.And while she appears to have abandoned the claim, many Tory Brexiteers insist the government should stick to its guns.They point out that, as Article 50 has been invoked and the Withdrawal Act passed, that is the default legal outcome.The hard Brexiteer argument is that while MPs can pass motions demanding a change in policy, they will not be binding on the government.Instead they say ministers should simply ignore MPs and try to force through a no-deal outcome. However, that kind of constitutional standoff could be incredibly difficult to sustain.   The Commons has the nuclear option of passing a no confidence vote in the government and putting the country on course for a general election. Although Eurosceptics claim, it would only require seven of them to switch sides or a larger number to abstain. The government also needs to pass legislation to pave the way for the least chaotic possible no deal, and ministers could expect the Commons equivalent of guerrilla warfare to wreck those efforts.  Renegotiate for a Canada-plus dealIf the PM goes down in flames, she - or another Tory PM - could try to go back to the EU and ask for a better deal.Brexiteers have been demanding the UK takes a different approach this time, seeking a looser Canada-style arrangement with the EU. The arrangement they want would be a relatively clean break from the EU, with the ability to strike trade agreements elsewhere.But it would fall far short of the low-friction access urged by Labour and large numbers of Tories. However, time would be a major obstacle, with just months until Brexit day. The EU has also insisted it will not unpick the orce package thrashed out in painstaking negotiations. Mrs May has also pointed out that the Canada model would not solve the Irish border issue, as there would need to be checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Eurosceptics dismiss this problem as confected, saying technology and trusted trade schemes can ensure there is no hard border.They also say that the EU would be more willing to compromise if it really believes that the UK would go through with a no-deal exit.  Second referendum and UK stays in the EUWith Westminster deadlocked, the possibility of asking the public to think again has strong appeal for many MPs.The so-called \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 campaign has been pushing hard for another national vote, with cross-party backing.Again, it is difficult to see how Parliament can trigger a referendum itself - but it could heap pressure on the government to the level where one becomes irresistible.One potential route would be for the Commons to vote no confidence in the government - leaving a caretaker Tory PM with a choice between a referendum and a general election if they lose a second confidence vote. The Article 50 process would probably need to be extended to facilitate a referendum, but the EU seems open to that possibility. Furious Brexiteers, including Michael Gove, have warned that Remainers smell an opportunity to reverse the 2016 vote altogether.He said at the weekend that holding a national vote would \u0027rip the fabric of society\u0027 - although he also claimed that Leave would win by more. Some suggest that a referendum could be fought between the option of Mrs May\u0027s deal and no deal. However, senior Labour figures appear to have come around to the idea of having Remain on the ballot. Tony Blair openly says a referendum should be a way of cancelling Brexit, and MPs across parties - such as Mr Grieve - regard it as probably the only sustainable way of overturning the 2016 result and staying in the EU. If a ruling from the European court next week goes as expected, Article 50 could then simply be revoked - leaving the UK with the same membership terms as now.     May vows she WILL push ahead with crunch vote on Brexit deal despite Cabinet ministers urging her to call it off to avoid catastrophic defeat Theresa May today vowed to push ahead with the crunch vote on her Brexit deal despite Cabinet ministers urging her to delay it to avoid a catastrophic defeat.The Prime Minister defied hardening opposition from Tory rebels and the DUP to make another impassioned plea for MPs to get on board with her plan.She warned there is no other option on the table, and killing her proposal off would either end up with the UK crashing out of the EU - or Brexit not happening at all. In interview on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, Mrs May said her fear was that \u0027Parliament in some way frustrates Brexit\u0027. The premier also confirmed that she is looking at ways to sweeten her blueprint for mutinous MPs - suggesting there could be a parliamentary \u0027lock\u0027 on the Irish border backstop arrangements coming into force. Asked repeatedly about calls from senior ministers to put off the Commons showdown on Tuesday, Mrs May said: \u0027We are in the middle of five days of debate in Parliament which will lead up to a vote on this issue.\u0027   At least three ministers have appealed directly to Prime Minister Theresa May (pictured giving her BBC interview today) in an attempt to postpone next week\u0027s Brexit deal vote in ParliamentDowning Street said Mrs May was discussing with MPs a \u0027greater role\u0027 for Parliament on the next steps as Britain goes through transition.  Pressed what her \u0027Plan B\u0027 is for what happens after what looks like an inevitable disaster, she said: \u0027That question is for those who want to oppose this deal.\u0027 Mrs May made clear that the Withdrawal Agreement she has thrashed out with Brussels is effectively locked in - but insisted she is \u0027listening\u0027 to concerns from MPs. She confirmed the government is considering a range of measures to make the Irish \u0027backstop\u0027 more palatable to her mutinous backbenchers.Proposals include placing a parliamentary \u0027lock\u0027 on the backstop, which would give MPs the final say over whether to enter an arrangement which critics fear could keep the UK trapped in the customs union indefinitely. \u0027The backstop is not automatic. I\u0027m looking at the role of Parliament in that choice,\u0027 Mrs May said.  The alternative would be to extend the transition period beyond December 2020 - but the Withdrawal Agreement states that can only last until 2022. After that point the backstop would come into force under the orce terms. Parliament will get to vote on whether to extend transition in June 2020 or to enter the backstop - subject to a final agreement with the EU - if trade talks are unfinished.After the extended transition ends, the backstop will kick in if there is still no final trade deal. Despite admitting the orce deal cannot be changed, Mrs May\u0027s spokeswoman said: \u0027She\u0027s aware of the strength of feeling and listening to colleagues about how parliament could have a wider say.\u0027     "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/06/14/490B1DBB00000578-6467335-One_voter_said_the_best_thing_about_fifth_place_Blackpool_is_the-a-8_1544106581487.jpg","title":"Has town just named one Britains worst","story":"    Huddersfield (above) topped the list.

Find out how to be a savvy Christmas shopper with our expert tips.Start earlyIt’s never too soon in December to think about Christmas purchases, says Amanda McCall, director at Gifts International. “The chronic procrastinators among us may not like to admit it, but the only way to do a good job on your Christmas shopping is to start early. We’ve all left buying an important gift until the last minute at some point, but you’re simply not going to find the perfect present if you’re dashing around the shops in a panic on Christmas Eve. So, this year, leave yourself plenty of time.”Be online shopping savvyBe organised about your online shopping and you’ll save time and money. “Decide on some themes from what you know about your family and friends,” says Lena Gore, co-owner of online retail company Find Me A Gift.Simon Exton from AO agrees: “I have lots of young nieces and nephews, so I decided that I was going to buy gaming stuff for them.”Put key dates in your diaryGet familiar with the last posting dates - this year, it’s 18 December for second class, 20 December for first class, 21 December for Royal Mail Tracked 24, and 22 December for Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed.Ask for suggestionsWe all want to give presents that our loved ones actually want. So rather than stressing about finding the perfect surprise, just ask them, says Lucy Ward, creative brand director at online marketplace Trouva. “More often than not, surprises can be a bit of a disappointment, and, in a world that’s thinking more sustainably, we want to be giving less and giving better gifts. I’m an advocate of just straight up asking people what they want. That way, you can guarantee your gift isn’t going to waste.”Stick to your budgetAgain, starting early is key to making sure you don’t spend too much. Make sure you know exactly how much you want to spend – Gore recommends working out an overall budget first, then inidual gift budgets. And she suggests subscribing to the newsletters of the websites you’re thinking of using, to keep an eye on their offers. “Buy as soon as you see an offer you like. If you leave it until the last minute, you’re more likely to impulse buy, which may mean breaking your budget.”Check your delivery datesMcCall recommends going for nominated day delivery options whenever possible. This means you can pick a time and day convenient for you, which is particularly helpful during the busy festive season. “You can also arrange for gifts to arrive while your family are out, so it won’t spoil the surprise before Christmas morning.” Check the delivery options available before you buy: electricals specialist AO offers free delivery on all items, including its Christmas gift ideas and stocking fillers, and provides both click and collect and next-day delivery.Be preparedAvoid the stress of unexpected visitors by stockpiling extra gifts, says McCall. “It’s always lovely to see family and friends during the festive season, but it can be quite embarrassing if you receive a gift and have nothing to offer in return.” She recommends keeping a few festive gifts wrapped up with the tags blank, so you can fill them out at a moment’s notice. “Chances are they’ll never even realise it was a last-minute gift.”Visit AO for great ideas for Christmas gifts and stocking fillers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aea2d1c42130903b3b47ef6c104657db4e78972/263_0_2661_1596/master/2661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b16e6edcefcd9abe44894faa7da92ef","title":"christmas unwrapped how do you open your presents","story":"From cryptic clues to silly stocking fillers, family rituals around present-giving can make for a more memorable festive experienceWhen it comes to opening Christmas presents, many families have their own time-honoured rituals. Maybe you just can’t wait until the 25th and always unwrap a present each on Christmas Eve before heading to mass? Or perhaps you all have to wait until your (usually late) uncle arrives at nana’s before the paper ripping can begin? Maybe you take your time over it and have a methodical approach, spreading out the present-opening over the course of the day.For many people, these traditions, re-enacted year after year with a comforting familiarity, are partly what makes Christmas special to them.Rachael Gibson, who runs The Hair Historian Instagram account, says her family has developed a rather unusual tradition when it comes to opening presents. At the family home in Sheffield, every family member has to present their gift with a cryptic clue tagged to it – and the recipient is forbidden from opening it until they’ve solved the conundrum. “The clue is usually to do with the present, and the format of the clues is pretty open, but they’re always cryptic-crossword-level complex – anagrams, or references to some historical figure or event,” she says.According to Gibson, her mother started adding cryptic clues to presents when she was a teenager. “My mum has always been a crossword fanatic, and she favours the extremely complicated cryptic ones,” she says. “She also loves quizzes and any kind of wordplay, so that has always been a big part of family life. At some point when we were teenagers, my mum decided to introduce a tradition that we had to write cryptic-crossword-style clues on our Christmas presents for one another. Setting clues is a challenge in itself, and I always have it in mind when I’m buying gifts.”The yearly ritual is so ingrained in the household that Gibson, who lives in London, says it wouldn’t feel like Christmas without it. “We’re a small family, with just the four of us, so I like that it marks out our gifts and makes them more special than anything else under the tree,” she says.The Agarwals, like many families, open one present each on Christmas Eve and then leave stockings at the end of their beds. “This has been the same for the past eight years or so,” says Pragya Agarwal, who lives in Formby, Merseyside, with her husband and three daughters – Prishita, 21, and twins April and India, both two. Christmas morning always begins with a hearty breakfast of pancakes and smoked salmon with scrambled eggs. Then the family sits next to the Christmas tree as her husband hands out one present at a time to each person, and they open them at the same time.“We all have our own inidual stockings that we use every year,” says Agarwal, the owner of gift businesses The Art Tiffin and Hedge and Hog Prints. “I bought the stockings in India, and they are beautifully handcrafted in traditional Indian designs. It makes me feel close to my parents who still live in India, and I feel that it fosters the same pride and closeness to their heritage in my children in some way.”Although the stocking fillers can vary from bath bombs to stationery, there are always the same three things sitting at the bottom: gold chocolate coins, a satsuma and a walnut. “Our eldest has grown up with these rituals and they are important to her,” says Agarwal.Creating traditions can define Christmas for families. “I feel that having continuity and these silly and very personal rituals make us feel closer as a family,” says Agarwal. “My twins are just two, so this would really be the first time that they’ll be able to understand Christmas, but I can’t wait to introduce these things to them too.”For great gift ideas and stocking fillers, check out AO’s Christmas range"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfd7c1ec0e7dd10eada046f5e340928c26ddfa96/0_0_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5cc37abf797038b5aa571db9b03d29e","title":"top toys for 2018 and the 500 extra youll spend five facts about christmas shopping","story":"Expect to see slime and the Boxer robot topping children’s gift lists, plenty of online shopping, and more socks under the treeWe spend the equivalent of two working weeks preparing for ChristmasChristmas is time-consuming.

This is a victory not just in defence of the copyright of my work, but it is also a declaration that we stand with those who oppose gun violence in America and elsewhere.”Cloud Gate, known locally as “the Bean”, was installed in Millennium Park in 2006 and has become a tourist attraction.The NRA video included a brief clip of the sculpture among other images designed to represent liberal America. The film’s voiceover warns against an undefined enemy who “use their media to assassinate real news”, “teach children that their president is another Hitler” and encourage people to “scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia”.

These days, it’s not unusual to see dozens of amateur photographers all pointing their smartphones in the same direction in a scramble to capture variations of the same shot. But scrums of professional photographers are an old and familiar phenomenon, with competing versions thus existing of many famous images. So what helps one picture stand out from the crowd?One of photographer Martin Jenkinson’s best-known pictures shows a protesting miner, wearing a toy policeman’s helmet, squaring up to a line of police officers. The black and white image holds both a playful humour and tension in its frame, pitting the lone protester in his parodic outfit against the dark block of officers facing him, one of whom looks directly at the lens. The image was taken at the Battle of Orgreave, a pivotal 1984 miners’ protest in which the police outnumbered demonstrators. Some officers, many argue, used excessive force. sent its own photographer, Don McPhee, to cover the event on the same day, and one of the images he came back with is very similar to Jenkinson’s. The framing is tighter and the protester looks directly into the eyes of the policeman facing him, lending a clearer air of confrontation to the image: Jenkinson and McPhee must have been standing only a few feet away from each other when these near-simultaneous photos were taken.There are many similar instances in the history of news photography. The famous image dubbed “tank man” of the lone protester facing down a line of tanks during the Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing in 1989 exists in shots by five photographers. Charlie Cole and Stuart Franklin took the image from the same balcony of the Beijing Hotel, while Jeff Widener and Arthur Tsang Hin Wah captured it from different floors. A barrage of photographers facing every news event has long been commonplace. “Certain events produce so many images that you can get fatigued looking through them all,” says the ’s news picture editor, Karin Andreasson. “Ultimately, you rely on your intuition, which is honed from years of experience.”Louisa Briggs, the curator of the first retrospective of Martin Jenkinson’s work, at Museums Sheffield, believes that the selection process for fine art photography works in a similar way. “When I was first looking though Martin’s photos, it was about a gut reaction,” she says, “and then I’d go back to the selected images and analyse them more. For visitors at an exhibition, they would also respond in a similar way.”The relative merits of the two Orgreave pictures rely on context as much as content. Andreasson prefers McPhee’s: “When looking for a good news picture, you want a strong composition, something that is dynamic, lit well and clean,” she says. “The McPhee has a wonderful direction of eye contact and a tighter crop, which lends an immediacy to it, whereas there is less of a sense of confrontation in the Jenkinson image. McPhee tells the story better, although both images show the fact that there is more than one truth to a story.”Capturing a different kind of story is what makes the Jenkinson image enticing to Briggs. “Since Martin was the National Union of Mineworkers’ photographer, he was based in Orgreave for around a month and won the trust of the miners,” she says. “He had a great rapport with them and could take images that captured the personalities of the people who were part of the strike and that really comes across in his photograph. In Martin’s image, the miner wearing the toy helmet feels more playful – it’s a more complex depiction of the miners’ strike, which often saw families with both policemen and miners in them facing each other.”Briggs adds that no story is ever simple. Jenkinson’s daughter, Justine, apparently told Briggs that the miner went to speak to the policemen because the officer had noticed a cricket badge on the miner’s jacket and so they were joking about the sport together. Jenkinson also took the image “to also document the fact that the policemen weren’t wearing their identification numbers”, Briggs says.“There could have been an element of performance to the images, since both photographers would have been shooting nearby,” Andreasson says, “and so McPhee would have chosen the image that summed up the written story as clearly as possible.”For Briggs, “McPhee is brilliant at that summation – he distils exactly what was going on around the miners’ strike,” and yet she believes Jenkinson chose the more nuanced portrait, “an emotive, human image”.Ultimately, both choosing what to shoot and taking the photograph itself depend on intuition: sensing something momentous or simply remarkable is in the offing and taking the gamble on capturing the precise moment of its happening. That gut reaction might be diluted when surrounded by dozens of others hunting the same thing, but each image is still unique and tells its own story. Even if that might be the fact of all the other photographers clamouring around you to get the perfect Instagram."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07dff9b2adbdea2fd3cf507ee3cf230d8a59afdd/0_153_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=bebe151493cb2bcc4fbc4adac0608c26","title":"o2 customers unable to get online","story":"Users of Tesco Mobile and Sky Mobile also hit as O2 blames supplier’s software glitchMore than 30 million customers of mobile providers including O2, Tesco Mobile and Sky Mobile have been unable to get online, with many also unable to make or receive phone calls, after a technical fault caused a UK-wide outage.The problem hit O2 and also affected companies that use its network, including its subsidiary Giffgaff and Lycamobile. The blackout of 3G and 4G services, which prevented customers from getting online on their phones, began at about 4am on Thursday and was still unfixed more than 12 hours later.O2, which has about 25 million UK customers, initially said voice calls were still working and advised people to seek out wifi if they needed to get online. “We’d encourage our customers to use wifi wherever they can and we apologise for the inconvenience caused,” a spokesman said.However, in an update later on Thursday the company admitted what many customers had been complaining on social media about all day: that they also could not make or receive calls.“As a result of this incident, we are experiencing a high demand on our network which means some customers may have issues making and receiving voice calls,” said a spokeswoman. “The network issue we are currently experiencing remains a top priority for us and we are working as quickly as possible to fix the issues.”The company said the problem stemmed from a global software issue at a third-party supplier, understood to be Ericsson, that had also affected other mobile operators around the world.“We’re aware that our customers are unable to use data this morning,” it said. “We believe other mobile operators around the world are also affected. Our technical teams are working with their teams to ensure this is fixed as quickly as possible.”The outage has also affected services such as Transport for London’s live updates of bus arrival times at stops across the capital, which relies on O2’s network for data updates.In October, O2 apologised for a major network outage affecting customers across the UK. The company said at the time that the issue was fixed within 40 minutes.O2’s rivals including Vodafone, Three and EE have also suffered nationwide outages affecting customers in the past year. In 2012, O2 was at the centre of a major network outage when customers were not able to access services for 25 hours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/533bfe37651249e9660963cb8f100d42186b7ab2/0_301_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8972a69e0ad8169c787de0f497483a9f","title":"two tesco directors cleared of false accounting","story":"Crown court jury instructed to acquit duo over the £250m black hole in profits in 2014Two former Tesco executives accused of masterminding a fraud that triggered the biggest financial crisis in the supermarket chain’s 100-year history have been cleared after the judge threw out the case stating the prosecution case was “so weak” it should not be before a jury.Chris Bush and John Scouler were acquitted after the judge Sir John Royce dismissed the case brought by the Serious Fraud Office in the wake of the 2014 accounting scandal that wiped £1.5bn off the value of Tesco shares in one day.“I concluded that, in certain crucial areas, the prosecution’s case was so weak that it should not be left for a jury’s consideration,” Royce said of his decision to abort the two-month trial which he added was “the end of a long saga”.Bush, who at 52 had spent his entire adult life working for Tesco until being suspended in 2014, welcomed the end of a “four-year ordeal”. The court heard that Bush had “dedicated his life” to the supermarket. He said he was looking forward to sleep and “spending Christmas with my family” now that it was over.Scouler was also “very happy” after the men were both cleared of one count of fraud and another of false accounting.The case stemmed from one of the most shocking episodes in recent corporate history, shortly after Dave Lewis took over as chief executive, replacing Philip Clarke, who had presided over a big decline in Tesco’s fortunes. On 22 September 2014 Lewis told the City that forensic accountants and lawyers had been called in to scrutinise its books after a whistleblower claimed payments from suppliers were being manipulated to make the grocer’s finances look healthier.At the time Tesco said the rogue practice had inflated profits by £250m.Bush and Scouler, who in 2014 was Tesco’s UK food commercial director, both stood trial last year but the case was abandoned before the jury was sent out. The SFO pursued a second trial which started two months ago.The SFO fought the dismissal but the defendants, who Royce said were “two men hitherto of impeccable character”, were acquitted by court of appeal judges on Wednesday. This could not be reported until the jury was discharged on Thursday.Royce said the jurors may have come to the conclusion that fraudulent activity had taken place among the supermarket’s buyers, but he explained: “One of the major issues has been whether the prosecution could prove the defendants were party to that.”Royce said: “The drive to achieve targets came from the very top, from Philip Clarke.”The acquittal of the two men means neither Tesco nor any of its executives have been successfully prosecuted over the accounting scandal, which destroyed investor confidence in what had been one of Britain’s most celebrated companies. Royce said the jurors, who had been following the extremely complex fraud case for several months, might be frustrated by the outcome. “It’s tempting to say somebody has got to pay,” he said, before informing them that Tesco had already paid the SFO a £129m fine and further legal costs as part of a deferred prosecution agreement, which is a type of plea bargain. “So don’t go away thinking somebody has got away with this. That’s what Tesco, on evidence you have heard, have agreed.”Given the heavy demands placed on jurors – the trial involved examining thousands of pages of complex internal documents – the judge excused them from further service for 20 years.The case’s failure represents a huge embarrassment for the SFO which was estimated to have spent more than £10m pursuing the former Tesco senior managers. It was still considering whether to launch a retrial of a third former director, Carl Rogberg, who is facing the same charges.The agency has suffered a string of high-profile failures including the 2016 collapse of a trial of five brokers accused of helping the convicted trader Tom Hayes to rig the Libor rate. Ross Dixon, a partner at the law firm Hickman and Rose which advised Bush, claimed the SFO had made “many basic mistakes” that “resulted in a four year ordeal … and the waste of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166ae58707500784277752697bc905504a511d5e/0_167_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=724bf73546b7976964138ab720a446c2","title":"bostons miracle how free nappies and a little mentoring are curbing","story":"The dramatic success of an initiative designed to forestall violence in US cities is gaining worldwide attentionStacy Spell is trying to save lives. The 20-odd youngsters ranged in a semicircle in front of him are healthy enough. But most are on a path towards early death.“If any one of you drops a body, your whole group will be targeted,” Spell booms, pacing the room like a public defender in a courtroom. “Even if you weren’t there, we will come after you.”The youths don’t move. All have criminal records. Most sit slumped in their chairs. One man with big, brown eyes wears his jacket with the collar so high that the zipper reaches his nose. His hands are buried deep in his pockets.“Take this message back to the barber shop, take it back to the club, take it back to your crew,” says Spell, a former homicide detective in New Haven, Connecticut, who is now part of a programme with a very different take on crime and punishment.Today, Kennedy’s team at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York supports more than 30 American cities. New Haven first tested GVI in 2012. The year before, there were 349 shots fired in the town of 130,000, and 27 people died. In 2017 it was 110 shots, killing six people.The success of GVI has been such that European countries are starting to take note. This session was attended by police officers from Malmo, Sweden, who are interested in following suit. Glasgow has established its own variant of GVI, offering young men a way out of crime through education, training and mentoring – delivered by people with experience of street violence.London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, recently announced an anti-violence unit modelled on Glasgow’s in a bid to curb knife crime.“We are eager to try,” says Glen Sjögren, Malmo’s police commissioner. “If we can make the shootings go down we can regain trust in the community. Our biggest problem today is that no one dares to testify.” He hopes Malmo’s success will inspire other Swedish cities to adopt the strategy.The GVI strategy is based around “call-ins” like the one Spell was addressing: a gathering of law enforcement officials, locals, former gang members, and young men attending as part of their probation or parole.Spell gives the men a stark choice. Stop the violence and a whole range of assistance will come their way: nappies for the kids, the right paperwork for a job, even help with relocation to get out of the damaging environment in which they live. Carry on, and prison awaits – or worse.Relatives and representatives of local services also attend. At the New Haven meeting, one social services coordinator, Letitia Charles, pointed at the audience as she asked the young men: “Have you ever heard it takes a village (to raise a child)? Look around you. You have a village.”The dialogue approach is based on carrots and sticks. The police also use peer pressure dynamics in criminal gangs to reach all members, not just the iniduals present at the call-in.Anthony Campbell, the chief of police, tells them he doesn’t want to attend another funeral. Lieutenant Herb Johnson presents some of the intelligence police have on a couple of local gangs. On a board, he shows the faces of some young criminals. “Sentenced to 20 years in prison”, reads a caption under one of them.Among the victims in 2011 was Sean Reeves’s son. He was hit in the neck by a stray bullet during a sudden street fight he never turned 16. Reeves attends the call-in to talk about the pain he awakens to each morning. Reeves himself once lived the criminal life at the age of 21 he lost his best friend to the streets.“I had women, jewellery and cars,” he says. “But I also missed the birth of my first daughter, my son’s first baseball game and my parents’ death.”After his speech, he says it’s impossible to reach them all: “To me, it’s about reaching one.”Last year, Kennedy’s team started to spread their research to Europe and Central America. Juárez, one of the world’s deadliest cities due to drug cartel wars, is among three Mexican cities implementing GVI. Police in El Salvador, seeking a way to handle Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13, a brutal gang wreaking havoc there, are also interested.At the end of the meeting, Spell gives each attendees his business card and shakes them by the hand. He tells them to call anytime.Almost a decade ago, Ducamel “Duke” Denis, 32, received a business card from Risco Mention-Lewis – now the city’s deputy police commissioner, everybody calls her Ms Lewis – at a call-in on Long Island, New York. They still talk at least once a week.Duke joins a regular support group at a resource centre run by Lewis. They get their coffee from 7-Eleven and sit on folding chairs. Lewis and her co-workers know everybody by name.Duke was arrested for the first time at the age of 16, in 2002. When he walked into the call-in in 2009, then called Operation Ceasefire, he was on probation for stolen property and gang assault and had done some prison time.“I knew I never wanted to go back. When they showed me everything they knew, I thought I was either going to be the best criminal I can ever be or quit. And I remember they said: ‘We don’t want to lock you up.’”Arrested in the past, Duke knew the police officers who were there.“I hated them back then. I don’t hate them any more.”Today he is working, studying and has his own photography business. He got into a couple of bad situations after the call-in, but calls it “the eye-opener”.He grew up with six sisters and his parents orced when he was a teenager. He quickly joined one of the local gangs in Long Island. Reminders are everywhere he still has a bullet in his lower back from when a rival gang “decided to go hunting”. Even now, he still bumps into former rivals sometimes. “You build bad blood with people. They view you as the person you were. I still remember when they did something to my family and brought tears to my eyes. Some people probably don’t think I deserve to live.”He drums his fingers at the table when he talks about his past, like he is impatient to change the subject. He admits he used to be tempted to go back to his former life for money, adrenaline and respect “to feed my ego”. These days, people rarely freeze when he walks into a supermarket.“But my kids care that I’m there,” he says with a smile that appears every time he talks about his son and two daughters.“I feel like a get a new chance every single day.”Additional reporting by Libby Brooks in EdinburghFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3e10dc432f91911d7f7d85ba092dbe36c0e4659/0_385_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=656fd1e39dd4da7c68707e24eaabceb0","title":"down with studentification how cities fought for their right not to party","story":"From Bristol to Nottingham, university towns across the country are facing up to the negative impacts of large student populationsIt’s 1.30am on a Sunday in Redland, Bristol, and a student party is in full swing. A front door opens and a young woman comes out dressed as a frog. But this isn’t your average slice of uni mayhem: immediately, the student hired to act as doorman darts forward with a finger to his lips. In the street, departing guests whisper while they wait for their Ubers.Their unusually considerate approach to late-night noise is based on fear of a large fine and disciplinary action from their university, which recently started cracking down, largely in response to the work of one local man. Andrew Waller started his campaigning website the Noise Pages in March this year after a rash of professionally organised student parties shattered the peace in this tight-knit neighbourhood.“When I went to remonstrate with the students, they were very in-my-face,” he says. “They knew they were breaking the university’s rules, and they were happy to tell me they didn’t care. They actually turned the music up.”With the police refusing to step in, and the university and council initially slow to act, Waller was “tipped over into activism”, he says. The Noise Pages now collates residents’ complaints about everything from loud midnight conversations to window-rattling dusk-till-dawn blowouts. Sample posts include: “This morning I had to sluice vomit from my front path,” and “I am literally being driven from my home by this specific problem.”The term “studentification” – coined by the academic Darren Smith in 2002 – refers to the impact student bodies have on the cities around them. For all the vibrancy a large influx brings to a local culture and economy, the indirect consequences can be profound: family homes make way for buy-to-let HMOs (houses of multiple occupancy), bars and fast-food outlets replace primary schools, and “street blight” takes hold as properties lie unkempt and deserted outside of term-time.Waller’s Chandos neighbourhood, bounded by Chandos Road and Waverley Road – aka “Raverley Road” – has the densest concentration of HMOs in Bristol, and is home to some 800 students. “They will frequently tell me: ‘This is a student area – you shouldn’t be surprised that we’re noisy,’” he says. “Sometimes they’ll go a step further and say: ‘Well, if noise bothers you, why don’t you move?’”With the number of full-time students in the UK having doubled since 1992, uni towns across the country are facing up to the “hollowing-out” effects of HMO densification. Councils including Oxford, Birmingham and Leeds have acted to restrict HMOs, as have Nottingham and Bristol, both of which are planning more purpose-built student accommodation. But whether undergrads will voluntarily opt to spend their second and third years in halls is another story: in TV shows from Fresh Meat to The Young Ones (which was shot in Bristol), the first student house, all mismatched sofas and unapproachable sink, is seen as a rite of passage.“We’ve definitely got our work on in terms of that,” says Piper. Waller, meanwhile, thinks “ghettoisation” in purpose-built accommodation would just store up problems for the future. “I would actually prefer to have students in the community,” he says, “just with a better set of rules.”Short of structural reform, what’s the best way to make students into better neighbours? One route is through deterrents. Nottingham’s two universities handed out 1,037 punishments last year for antisocial behaviour alone, while Bristol recently raised its maximum fines for such behaviour to £250 and launched an awareness course that uses victim statements to teach offenders about the impact of their late-night antics.Whether these pleas for unity are getting across is another question. In Bristol, Waller’s website has caused consternation among students who feel they are being targeted simply for having fun. “It’s always hard to tell with these people, isn’t it?” said one student who did not wish to be named. “At first you think they have a point, and then they complain another 1,500 times and you’re thinking, are you making this up?”To remedy the situation, the university now funds a police patrol on weekends and big nights such as Halloween, while every first-year student attends a compulsory talk about being a good “ambassador”. Then there’s the Best Neighbour on Campus award, which recognises considerate households, and voluntary litter-picks. An end-of-term project called Leave Newcastle Happy raised £125,000 in unwanted goods for the British Heart Foundation last year.Marc Lintern, Newcastle University’s director of student experience, says the sight of undergrads giving something back has helped break down residents’ mistrust: “Part of it is about tidying up, and part of it is about the residents getting to know the students so they don’t see them as alien creatures.”If universities are anxious to set a good example for students, they could do worse than soften their own sometimes remote and inaccessible images within cities – perhaps by opening their facilities to the public. San Jose University in the US did just that, co-funding the renovation of a library in which students and the community could read side-by-side. UK universities including Oxford Brookes and the University of Hertfordshire welcome the public into their libraries, but most stop short of borrowing rights.In fact, the US is the leader in the increasingly professionalised field of town-gown relations. Its International Town and Gown Association, established in 2008, now has a UK arm, which last week held its biennial conference at Queen’s University Belfast. Vice-chancellors, police officers, student union representatives, city officials and academics – including Darren Smith of “studentification” fame – were present to compare notes on HMOs, household recycling and student safety.Conference coordinator, Poppy Humphrey, who works as off-campus student affairs officer for Manchester Student Homes – which handles community liaison for both University of Manchester and Manchester politan – says that coming together is crucial for workers in a comparatively new area: “It was important to hear that what we experience in Manchester, our colleagues in other towns and cities do as well.” She says the biggest challenge she and her peers face is the transient nature of the student body: “You’re not dealing with a static group of people – it’s a new cohort each time. But it also means that each year we can develop and grow and try new ideas.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08269dc241b0d12ab14b967388062d8955d7f6cb/0_574_4372_2623/master/4372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51ab63e9e43cc4d37f4b8f6dadcdc0c1","title":"rios squatter communities turn derelict buildings into homes in pictures","story":"As the city’s homeless population has grown, squatting projects have become more organised in an attempt to secure abandoned houses as homes for the poor.

A compromise intended to reconcile a badly ided parliament ended up alienating most MPs. Yet what would these opponents of the deal suggest as an alternative? Pose this question, and the crass dishonesty of much of the Brexit debate becomes all too apparent.It’s only fair to start by saying that there are opponents of the deal with more or less credible (let’s leave desirable to one side) alternatives in mind. At one extreme are the no-dealers, happy to take the plunge and then, once the initial confusion has died down, trade with the EU “on World Trade Organization terms”. At the other are the remainers, those determined to secure another referendum as a means to remaining within the EU.It is perfectly legitimate to question whether actively seeking the chaos that a rejection of the prime minister’s deal would entail is the kind of thing MPs should be engaged in. And there is also room to wonder about the wisdom of former supporters of a soft Brexit along so-called “Norway” lines now dismissing even the prime minister’s plan as equivalent to “slavery”.But the issue here is alternatives to the deal – and at least these two groups have their own in mind. As for the rest, all that is apparent is cakeism. Lots of it. In all conceivable flavours.Let’s start with the hard Brexit brigade. For them, Theresa May has conceded too much to the EU. First, with the provisions for a customs territory, which would impede our ability to sign trade deals (whisper it quietly, Donald Trump had a point). Second, with the concomitant “level playing field” conditions the EU has imposed, tying the UK to regulatory alignment in several areas.Unfortunately, their preferred outcome – a Canada-style agreement – runs into the problem of Ireland. And so the solution, in the words of Boris Johnson at the DUP conference the other day, is to “junk the backstop and agree that neither side will introduce a hard border in Northern Ireland”.So far, so unfeasible. Since December 2017 May has attempted to convince the EU to scrap the backstop. Brussels has simply refused. Michel Barnier could not have been clearer, speaking before the European parliament the week after Johnson’s speech: “Without a backstop for Ireland, there will be no withdrawal agreement.” The Brexiters’ alternative simply does not exist.Now let’s turn our attention to those who criticise the prime minister’s deal from the other side. Exhibit A here is the Labour party. They, apparently, oppose it because they could negotiate a better one.The origins of this policy are nothing if not curious. Addressing parliament in January 2017, former Brexit secretary David Davis declared that it was his ambition to sign an agreement with the EU that would “deliver the exact same benefits as we have”, while leaving the single market and allowing the UK to sign trade deals with the rest of the world. The secretary of state was talking nonsense.This soft Brexit compromise has been championed by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles as a plan B for leaving the European Union if Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is defeated in the Commons.It is based on Norway’s relationship with the EU, which is outside the bloc and the customs union but inside the single market. Under the plan the UK would have to join Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland in the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which would then allow it to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).The ‘plus’ in this option refers to a temporary customs union with the EU, which would need to be negotiated to avoid a hard border ion the island of Ireland. The temporary arrangement would remain in place until the EU and UK agreed a specific trade deal.The option has the advantage of being as close to the EU as possible without full membership, and it would do away with the need for a problematic backstop for Northern Ireland. Like Norway, the UK would be outside the common fisheries and agriculture policies, and would not be subject to the European court of justice.But it crosses a key red line for Brexiters by continuing freedom of movement, one of the preconditions of single market membership. It would also limit the UK ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence inside the bloc.Rather than simply point this out, the opposition adapted and adopted this nonsense as policy. Speaking in February this year, Jeremy Corbyn declared that Labour would seek a deal that “maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union”. He added that he would negotiate a customs arrangement that would allow the UK a say in future EU trade deals, while also being able to negotiate its own deals. Meanwhile (all the while retaining the benefits of the single market, remember), freedom of movement would end and the UK would not be “a passive recipient of rules decided elsewhere by others”. Again, the EU could not have been clearer. The four freedoms are inisible and non-membership means no seat at the table. Labour, like the Brexiters, has no credible alternative to the government’s plan.Finally, there are those who argue that May’s deal should be rejected in favour of what has come to be known as Norway plus – membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) plus the customs union. Nick Boles recently argued that this offers the only plausible alternative to May’s deal.Admittedly, this scheme seems a strange way to honour the result of the referendum. If immigration and sovereignty really were central to its outcome, becoming a rule taker and continuing to pay significant sums to the EU while accepting free movement hardly seems compatible with it.Moreover, it is far from clear that the EU would simply allow the UK into the Efta pillar of the EEA. While the EU might have countenanced the EEA for relatively small neighbours such as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, they would impose severe conditions on the UK were it to try to emulate them, not least by restricting the ability to erge over EU regulations and insisting on level playing field conditions to ensure that British governments did not seek to undercut EU regulations in the future.Nor does Norway plus solve the Northern Ireland issue. The backstop would still be required to cover the eventuality of the UK deciding to leave the EEA, while, if the UK leaves the common agricultural policy, Northern Ireland specific solutions would be required to prevent the need for an intra-Irish border.Many opponents of the prime minister’s plan, therefore, have nothing better, or at least nothing obviously credible, to offer in its place. Of course, in the short term, all this might not matter. May looks certain to lose the “meaningful vote” on 11 December by a significant margin. This first vote, then, is coming to look like a “free hit”, a chance to register a protest safe in the knowledge the motion will be easily defeated.However, what happens thereafter matters enormously. Signalling displeasure in the first vote is one thing. Voting it down in the second another entirely. There are good reasons to dislike what May has brought back. But surely those who do so should be able to come up with practical alternatives. Or have the honesty to say they support no deal or no Brexit.• Anand Menon is director of The UK in a Changing Europe and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8faf344a277885b90cef236c42335ddd9c739e02/0_104_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0521b8576041b7c9f7b9e6f8a65d606f","title":"drafted article 50 brexit referendum eu state","story":"People once dreamed of a Brexit that would give Britain more control and free us from paying anything to Brussels, while opening up the prospect of huge new trade deals and “the exact same benefits” we have today as EU members.Now, in the cold light of a Brexit dawn, we have a withdrawal agreement that will see the European court handing down rulings binding on the UK for years – if not decades – to come, with us trapped in a backstop deal from which, as the attorney general has confirmed, there is no unilateral escape. Meanwhile we would face endless negotiations to create what would only ever be second-class access to Europe’s markets and, lest we forget, a £50bn orce bill.Little wonder that the government has had to look for other arguments to support the deal. What it has hit on is that an alternative to its Brexit is an even worse Brexit. It talks up the prospect of a “no-deal” option – of jammed ports, grounded aeroplanes and emptied supermarket shelves – with the same relish that bad parents use when trying to scare their children into bed with tales of monsters.But we now know that the idea that this choice – a bad deal or no deal – is as much a fantastical nightmare as the earlier promises about Brexit were a dream.This week the advocate general of the EU’s court of justice published advice to the court about the revocability of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU under article 50 of the EU treaty. He has confirmed that we have an absolute right to change course and take back our withdrawal notification without paying any price – financial or political.I admit this is something of a specialist subject for me: I was secretary general of the European convention that drafted the article. I have always believed that nothing in it restricted our rights as a full EU member to change our minds, stay in and keep all our current rights, privileges and opt-outs: Margaret Thatcher’s budget rebate, John Major’s exemption from joining the Euro, Theresa May’s opt-in to the European Arrest Warrant and Europol.I was not, therefore, particularly surprised that the advocate general advised the court in the way he did. The full court could disagree, but such reversals are rare.Even as the court was confirming that staying in the EU was an option, the idea that we might slide out without a deal was being cleared from the table. Dominic Grieve and Chris Bryant, in different parties but both experts on parliament and the constitution, came together to list six further ways in which parliament could put the brakes on any attempt to pull the UK out with no deal. The defeat of the government on the procedural amendment tabled by Grieve provides a guarantee that MPs will have a proper say over what happens next.The long and the short of it is this: the idea that no deal is either a credible threat in frightening MPs, or that it is the default option if we reject the deal have both been killed off. There is no bar on parliament preventing no deal and no responsible government would ever want to force the country into it, when it knows it is so easily stopped.The real debate now is between leaving under the humiliating terms of the proposed withdrawal agreement, with no certainty about the eventual permanent relationship, or staying with our current rights as full members, with a voice, a vote and veto.So the choice is between a bad Brexit deal and sticking with the deal we have in the EU. And it’s a choice for the people. I don’t think it would be right for parliament to just vote to stop the Brexit process. The people started this with their vote and they must make the final decision.Almost certainly that will require some extension of the article 50 deadline beyond 29 March. The treaty is very clear about this – it can be done but requires unanimity among all EU states. If our purpose in asking for an extension was to allow time for a referendum, there is no doubt that all would agree. Brexit would be bad for everyone, though obviously worst for us.And that leads me to one more, final, Brexiter fantasy, that we would ask for an extension to negotiate a “better” Brexit. For that there is no enthusiasm in any European capital. Dreams of a Norway-for-now-or-ever are just that – dreams.The deal we have been offered is not what was promised and it’s not nearly as good as the deal we’ve got in the EU, but it’s the only Brexit offer on the table.Today was the day the terms of the debate changed because, if MPs and ultimately the British people, think it’s a bad deal, we know we can reject it without fear.• Lord Kerr drafted article 50 and is a former UK ambassador to the EU"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a9094fc63a8cc58614a9ceac2cf8d36e6dfc5c8/0_204_6127_3677/master/6127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1132926fa0523208fddb9a3a27fcb411","title":"peoples vote brexit len mccluskey leave","story":"Hello, and welcome to another day of gazing into an abominable black hole and wondering when it was that life suddenly seemed devoid of meaning – or, as I believe this process is more commonly known, Brexit negotiations.Today we discuss the possibility of a second referendum, which the government is unequivocally ruling out, and about which the Unite leader, Len McCluskey, has – reportedly – expressed private reservations. This is in sharp contrast to the People’s Vote crew, who have thrown everything but the kitchen sink at forcing the country to relive the ordeal of the first referendum.Not long ago I was a guest, alongside Peter Mandelson, on Politics Live, where I witnessed him criticise Theresa May’s fledgling Brexit deal as being a halfway house that no one voted for. It was as though he had been possessed by Jacob Rees-Mogg (and let’s face it, if there is one politician capable of demonic possession, it’s probably Rees-Mogg). So was this the game plan? Sabotage any deal in the hope that the prospect of hurtling towards a no-deal scenario will force a second referendum? It’s high-risk, but it may well succeed, as – despite the prime minister’s protestations – a second referendum seems more likely than ever.So if there is a second referendum, what’s next? I ask because the People’s Vote strategy presently seems to be:One can’t help but suspect that some of the leading lights of this movement view the acquisition of the vote as a mere formality in order to remain in the European Union. In conversations with the centrist elements of the People’s Vote campaign, I get the impression that they feel they were sidelined by Cameron’s team the first time around, and expect automatic victory if they – and their election-winning magnificence – are in charge the second time.This is dangerous, because it suggests that they may well end up in a power struggle with the more leftwing elements of the remain movement, such as Another Europe is Possible and if historical performances are anything to go by, they will waste a lot of broadcast time on berating Jeremy Corbyn rather than explaining why we should stay in the EU.Then there’s the Labour party, which is focusing on a general election. This is entirely the right thing to do: only by implementing the Labour manifesto is there any hope of healing the social and economic damage that led to Brexit (though why anyone would want to be in charge of the Brexit negotiations is beyond me – nobody volunteers to captain the Titanic). The problem for Labour, though, is that it doesn’t get to decide whether we have a second referendum or not. So the party may well end up in the situation where it’s fighting a second referendum without a clear argument about why we should, presumably, remain. The party urgently needs to come up with an in-case-of-second-referendum-break-glass strategy.The comments attributed to McCluskey are absolutely right: a huge number of voters in this country were sold a beautiful tomorrow by the leave campaign, and will feel betrayed by any attempt to take that away. One man I interviewed recently told me: “I didn’t really know anything about it until the referendum. I wasn’t that interested. But then I heard all the arguments to leave and I thought ‘brilliant!’”A second remain campaign will have to convince people like this man that the beautiful tomorrow offered by staying in the EU is better than the one he expects from leaving it. I know what remain voting readers will say in response: he was lied to. And maybe he was. But he doesn’t believe you he believes them – because they ran a better campaign.A collective amnesia seems to have erased the memories of what happened the first time around. Have we all forgotten the Breaking Point poster, the rise in hate crimes, Empire 2.0, Marine Le Pen celebrating the leave vote? It’s highly likely that, in a second referendum, we would have the leave campaign on steroids, its most ghastly elements at the front screaming betrayal and being even more hardline against immigration.If the people agitating for a second referendum want to risk unleashing those forces again, they had better make damn sure they’re going to win. And that doesn’t mean remain limping over the line with around half the vote: it means winning an argument and convincing the population of a vision for the future in which people born overseas play a central part. It’s true that Caroline Lucas and Another Europe Is Possible have been attempting to build this vision, but it isn’t front and centre of the People’s Vote campaign.If remainers have their own sunlit uplands to promise the country in the event of a second referendum, I don’t know what they look like. And if a political commentator who spends about eight hours a day reading and thinking about current affairs hasn’t got the memo, it’s unlikely that the rest of the country has. This is a problem that needs fixing before a second referendum can be fought. If it isn’t, the best outcome we can hope for is a continuing stalemate where the roles are reversed. And at worst, the most reactionary, rightwing elements of British politics will emerge victorious all over again.• Ellie Mae O’Hagan is a regular contributor to the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/068342df29b3686613549b7861c0e0815af91877/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49f7a5b602b8d0d2e993c4e7e40a96e","title":"republicans are staging mini coups across the us","story":"An 11th-hour tactic in Wisconsin is an attack on progressive causes and the integrity of the electoral processDemocracies empower the will of majorities. In the US, Republican lawmakers on both the state and national level have rejected that basic principle.In a lame-duck session in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, Republican legislators in the state of Wisconsin passed a sweeping bill designed to radically check the powers of the incoming governor. The result of this 11th-hour tactic is an attack on progressive causes, the integrity of the electoral process, and democratic accountability.Last month, Democrat Tony Evers won the state gubernatorial race, unseating Republican incumbent Scott Walker. Among other things, Evers, who made affordable healthcare a key issue in the race, promised to withdraw Wisconsin from yet another tiresome suit against provisions of Obamacare. But the Republican bill would strip him of the power to do so.Evers also made gun control a central issue of the campaign, promising to ban guns from the Wisconsin Capitol. No, the legislators now say, you can’t do that.Evers promised to clean up Wisconsin’s “Economic Development Corporation”. Created by Governor Walker, the EDC is the kind of scandal-ridden, crony-stacked organization that the great Republican senator from Wisconsin Robert La Follette once labored tirelessly to expose and reform. But now legislators have acted to undermine the governor’s power to regulate the wasteful and arguably corrupt corporation.However disgraceful, the power grab by Wisconsin’s Republican legislators is hardly idiosyncratic. Hard on the heels of Democrat Ray Cooper’s capturing the governorship of North Carolina in 2016, Republican legislators in that state voted to aggressively limit the governor’s power. Last month, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer captured the governor’s seat in Michigan, trouncing her Republican opponent by 10 percentage points. Lame-duck Republican legislators are now scheming to strip the state’s highest executive of essential powers. On the national level, Senate Republicans stunningly refused to so much as grant Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nominee to the supreme court, a hearing.Pundits have described these actions as Republicans playing “hardball”, though the description obscures a noxious reality: Republicans aren’t playing ball at all – they are rejecting the basic rules of the game. The notion that elections count only when our side wins is nothing short of a repudiation of democracy. Republicans, on both the national and state level, are essentially staging minor coups.If Republicans no longer respect the rules of the democratic process, then they must be forced to pay a political price for their arrogance. And yet Republicans have been largely insulated from paying this price thanks to the success of an even more audacious campaign to nullify the peoples’ will.Hyper-partisan gerrymandering is perhaps the most radically anti-democratic fixture of our present political reality. We should all, then, be encouraged by one of most consequential, but largely overlooked, results of last month’s midterms.Voters in Michigan, Missouri, Colorado and Utah passed ballot initiatives emphatically rejecting such gerrymandering. They endorsed the creation of non-partisan redistricting commissions or otherwise voted to limit the power of a controlling party to unilaterally draw electoral maps.We can only hope that these efforts will spread and succeed, spelling the end of radical Republican efforts to ignore the will of the majority."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2932619e68dbb2c6edb2360288947c322b634321/0_0_941_576/master/941.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cd8199b6bee43e2423cc6023e42b0069 1880w","title":"third of maintained english secondary schools in the red","story":"Average annual loss has risen to £484,000, while spending per pupil has fallenThree out of every 10 maintained secondary schools had budget deficits of nearly £500,000 last year, according to new figures on local authority spending that shed further light on the funding crunch hitting schools and nurseries in England.Jules White, a secondary headteacher and the founder of the Worth Less? campaign against school funding cuts, said children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) were likely to be the worst affected by the funding shortfall.“Our system has no more fat to trim and we’re down to the gristle. Schools can’t increase class sizes or reduce staffing any further,” White said.“Surely the Treasury and DfE have noticed that both maintained schools and academies are sliding into debt and this is against a background which stipulates that we’re not supposed to set deficit budgets.Labour said the figures also revealed that spending on Sure Start children’s centres went down by £90m last year.“The chronic underfunding of these vital services by the Tories is leading to centres being lost across the country and the most vulnerable are paying the price,” said Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary.The DfE figures revealed that secondary schools have been cutting back over the past year, with total expenditure per pupil down from £6,218 to £6,137. Income generated by schools, including donations from parents, was £359 per pupil.Jon Andrews, the deputy head of research at the Education Policy Institute, said the figures were a stark reminder of the financial pressures facing schools.“Ahead of next year’s spending review, the Department for Education and the Treasury will need to consider not only the schools budget but also the impact on schools of cuts to wider public expenditure,” Andrews said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fe6fe99102ebcd3264d29f7cf20f78f1abf1dcc/1_693_1871_1122/master/1871.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da66cda3b4fd1f038257f8e5de8a3095","title":"december dressing outfit inspiration for the month ahead","story":"The temperature may ebb and the rains may come, but you’re guaranteed a baseline of chilliness this month.

Leading the field with six nods, including actor and director, is Adam McKay’s enjoyable, if flashily self-aware political comedy Vice, with its glowering portrayal of former vice-president, big oil nabob and war-on-terror enthusiast Dick Cheney, who the film shows effectively leading America throughout the presidency of George W Bush.Christian Bale has put on considerable amounts of weight and latex for the role and the result is undoubtedly entertaining, although I wonder if the surge of enthusiasm for this movie represents a guilty rush of liberal nostalgia for the good old days when the Republican bad guys, however horrible, were smart and rational people who had the good taste to keep a relatively low profile, and you kind of knew where you stood with them. The movie actually finishes with a post-credits sting which makes the director’s attitude to the new Trumpian zeitgeist and its standard of political debate pretty clear. Amy Adams is also up for best supporting actress for her performance as Cheney’s formidable wife Lynne, and Sam Rockwell for his amiable, undemanding and more subtly latexed turn as Dubya himself.Behind the six nominations for Vice is four apiece for Yorgos Lanthimos’s exhilaratingly mad post-Restoration romp The Favourite with its outstanding performance from Olivia Colman Peter Farrelly’s Green Book, starring Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen as a classical pianist and his driver and Bradley Cooper’s brilliant and extravagant sugar-rush remake of A Star Is Born. Of these, the most prominent is obviously A Star Is Born, with its wonderful lead performance from Lady Gaga. Warner Bros has – perhaps a little over-solemnly – entered A Star Is Born in the Globes’ “drama” section rather than “musical or comedy”. Obviously, it isn’t funny and it is dramatic, but I would have liked to see this film honoured for its all-important musical content. Surely its song Shallow is going to walk off with best song, and as for the rest, who can tell? I love it, but A Star Is Born could yet find itself pipped at a number of posts, and in the best picture (drama) category, Barry Jenkins’s If Beale Street Could Talk might have the edge.The Favourite is a jagged, sharp-clawed picture which has snagged the attention of everyone who has seen it, since it opened on the festival circuit at the end of the summer and praising it has become de rigueur among opinion-makers. It’s based on real-life figures from the English court – which could have been given a very square bonnets-and-ruffles period-drama treatment, but which Lanthimos’s unique style elevates to a quite different kind of absurdist spectacle. Olivia Colman’s Queen Anne is a thing of joy.Green Book is based on a true story: the relationship between classical pianist Don Shirley (Ali) and his Italian-American driver and bodyguard Tony Vallelonga (Mortensen) in the 60s. It’s a heart-in-the-right-place movie which could find itself doing well, but I think it will be crowded out in the end.Elsewhere, it is impossible not to see a couple of outrageous snubs. Ari Aster’s superlative scary movie Hereditary didn’t get into the best film (drama) category well, all right, but surely Toni Collette deserved a shot at best actress for her superb performance? Well, at all events, it is great to see Glenn Close in that category for her subversively enigmatic literary spouse in The Wife. That surely has to be favourite. Also, it’s great that John C Reilly has been nominated for his (excellent) performance as Oliver Hardy in Jon S Baird’s Stan \u0026amp Ollie – though not nominating Steve Coogan, who played Stan Laurel, is just silly.On now to the subject of the film which most believe to be the very best of the year: Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma: this has screenplay, director and best foreign language film – although its status as a foreign-language film appears to have ruled it out of the best film categories. I think Cuarón deserves best director, although I wonder if he might get beaten out of the best foreign-language spot by the more obviously heart-tugging Capernaum, by Nadine Labaki, though I have to admit to not sharing the dewy-eyed praise for that film.Elsewhere, Bohemian Rhapsody has done very well with a best actor (drama) nod for Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury and even a best drama nomination. Those are nominations which are interestingly in tune with a current of popular opinion which really likes this film, and which is impatient with critical voices who found it bland or straightwashed.And ever since Ryan Coogler’s highly entertaining superhero movie Black Panther, the debate has been whether the awards establishment can find a way to honour its overwhelming success. The Globes, with their unstuffy tradition of recognising movies which are not solemn awards-bait, would be the place, but Black Panther has not in fact dominated the field.Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman has been coolly picking up praise and enthusiasm since it emerged at Cannes back in May. Now its nominations include best director for Lee himself, best drama and best actor for John David Washington. I was agnostic about it, but this is a movie whose awards momentum could yet pick up.For me, this years Globes “silly” vote goes to Mary Poppins Returns with a very respectable set of nods for best musical or comedy, actress (for Emily Blunt) and actor (Lin-Manuel Miranda). Hmmm. MPR isn’t bad, and it has some lovely showstoppers at the very beginning. But the confectionery really isn’t that nutritious or appetising by the end.So a reasonable Globes list, with the surreal prospect of Dick Cheney squaring off with Lady Gaga for the big prizes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8538aaa7f4970370d76cf56ea74c1d573cb67094/220_0_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15882fb2fa12a3173a3a1d22211c9c14","title":"golden globes 2019 vice leads pack with six nominations","story":"Adam McKay’s comedy starring Christian Bale as Dick Cheney picks up most nods. A Star Is Born, The Favourite and Green Book each take five – while Widows and Sorry to Bother You are among high-profile snubsDick Cheney may never have officially ruled over America, but Vice, a new biopic about the power-hungry politician, is the surprise leader going into next year’s Golden Globe awards. The comedy stars Christian Bale – who gained 40lb and wears a bald-cap for the role – as George W Bush’s deputy, and has been nominated for best actor, best director, best motion picture (comedy or musical), best screenplay, best supporting actor (for Sam Rockwell, who plays Bush), and best supporting actress (for Amy Adams, who plays Cheney’s wife Lynne).The film is the Anchorman director Adam McKay’s follow-up to the financial smash The Big Short, which was up for four Globes and five Oscars a couple of years ago – but converted them into only one win.Set to open later this month in the US, Vice beat predicted frontrunner A Star Is Born, which, having already stormed both the box office and pop charts, was expected today to launch its assault proper on awards season. But in the end, Bradley Cooper’s remake of the classic Hollywood saga had to make do with nods for himself as actor and director, best original song (for Shallow), best leading actress in a drama for Lady Gaga, and best drama.Warner Bros’ decision to enter the film in the drama category rather than “comedy or musical” was controversial but signals its intention to push the title for major awards this season, rather than risk relegation on the basis it might not be sufficiently heavyweight. Universal Pictures has followed suit, trying the same tactic with Bohemian Rhapsody, its Freddie Mercury biopic starring Rami Malek which picked up two nominations.The Favourite, Yorgos Lanthimos’s black comedy set in the court of Queen Anne, got nominations for screenplay, comedy, leading actress Olivia Colman and supporting actresses Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone.Green Book got the same number of nods. The road-trip comedy starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali has come under fire for what some perceive as a whitewashed version of racial history, but it is performing well with audiences and took the Toronto People’s Choice award in September – a gong previously won by the likes of Slumdog Millionaire, 12 Years a Slave and The King’s Speech, each of which went on to win the best picture Oscar.Mary Poppins Returns and BlacKkKlansman performed better than expected with four nominations apiece (including Emily Blunt for her leading role in the former) Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk and the Marvel movie Black Panther took three apiece. Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma – the film topping most critics’ best-of-2018 lists – also took three: best screenplay, best director and best foreign-language film.Three of this year’s five best drama nominees – BlacKkKlansman, Black Panther and If Beale Street Could Talk – are films by black directors featuring largely black casts. The spread of acclaim was by and large wider than expected, with surprise nominations for smaller titles such as gritty cop drama Destroyer, Diablo Cody’s post-natal depression comedy Tully, Bo Burnham’s debut Eighth Grade and the Vincent Van Gogh biopic Eternity’s Gate, potentially at the expense of big-hitters such as First Man – the moon landings drama starring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong – which took just two nominations.Widows, Steve McQueen’s follow-up to 12 Years a Slave, was arguably the greatest casualty – it scored no nominations, not even for much fancied leading actress Viola Davis. Boots Riley’s acclaimed satire Sorry to Bother You also went unrecognised. As did Clint Eastwood’s on-screen swansong The Mule, Hugh Jackman-starring political comedy The Front Runner, historical drama Mary, Queen of Scots and the Ruth Bader Ginsberg biopic On the Basis of Sex.Cold War, the new film from Ida director Paweł Pawlikowski, was also snubbed, as was First Reformed, Paul Schrader’s return to form starring Ethan Hawke as an anguished priest.Brits performed well across the board in the film acting categories: as well as nominations for Colman, Weisz and Blunt, Rosamund Pike was recognised for her work playing foreign correspondent Marie Colvin in A Private War, while Richard E Grant took a best supporting actor credit for playing Melissa McCarthy’s dissolute friend in Can You Ever Forgive Me?There was a strong British showing in the television portion of the awards. The BBC fact-based drama A Very English Scandal received three nominations: a best limited series nomination, a best actor in a limited series nomination for Hugh Grant for his performance as disgraced Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe, and a supporting actor in a limited series nod for Ben Whishaw for his performance as Thorpe’s lover Norman Josiffe.“Very, very kind of the Hollywood Foreign Press. Am opening a jumbo jar of Vaseline in celebration,” Grant wrote on Twitter in response to the nomination.Two other BBC productions, Killing Eve and Bodyguard, received multiple nominations: Killing Eve for best drama and best actress in a drama for star Sandra Oh and Bodyguard for best drama nomination and best actor for star Richard Madden. Madden will face off in that category against Welsh actor Matthew Rhys, who was nominated for the final series of The Americans. The 80s spy drama also received a best TV drama nomination and a best TV drama actress nod for Rhys’s partner and co-star Keri Russell.The best actor – limited series category saw Benedict Cumberbatch recognised for his turn as Patrick Melrose in the Sky Atlantic drug-addiction drama of the same name, while Sacha Baron Cohen got a best actor in a comedy nomination for his work on Showtime’s satirical prank show Who Is America. Thandie Newton, meanwhile, received a supporting actress drama nod for her performance in Westworld.Hollywood talent was also well accounted for in the TV categories, with Julia Roberts claiming a best actress – drama nomination for paranoid thriller Homecoming, and Amy Adams and Penelope Cruz both receiving best actress – limited series nods for Sharp Objects and The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, respectively. Laura Dern was recognised for her performance in the HBO child abuse drama The Tale, while Jim Carrey’s turn as a slowly unravelling children’s TV host in Showtime’s Kidding earned him a best comedy actor nod, and Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin were nominated for best actor comedy and best supporting actor comedy respectively for their roles as bickering old friends in Netflix sitcom The Kominsky Method.Other series to receive multiple nominations included the Ben Stiller-directed prison break drama Escape at Dannemora, acclaimed Margaret Atwood adaptation The Handmaid’s Tale, the Ryan Murphy-produced trans rights drama Pose, and Amazon comedy The Marvelous Mrs Maisel.In addition to the regular nominations came the announcement of a new honorary award for achievement in television. The award, which is as yet unnamed, will act as the TV equivalent of the Globes’ Cecil B De Mille Award, which recognises “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment”.The Globes reputation as an Oscars bellwether has diminished in recent years, with the organisation increasingly erging in its choices from the Academy. The makeup of both bodies’ voters also starkly contrasts, since the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences increased the number and ersity of its members in recent years. Earlier this year, the Academy invited a record number of new members, adding 928 to the 6,500 or so already in the club. Following the #OscarsSoWhite controversy in 2016, the body committed to doubling its number of women and erse members by 2020.The Globes, meanwhile, are voted for by 90 entertainment journalists based in Los Angeles but writing for international publications. Their identities have long been mysterious, but one of their number, Aida Tekla, came to notoriety earlier this year after an idiosyncratic interview she purportedly conducted with Drew Barrymore ran in EgyptAir’s inflight magazine.Last year’s Globes were dominated by Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which took best drama, best original screenplay, best actress in a drama and best supporting actor, while Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird won best comedy or musical and best actress in a comedy or musical for Saoirse Ronan. The Oscars, meanwhile, gave best picture (and best director) to Guillermo del Toro’s The Shape of Water, while Three Billboards took best actress and best supporting actor. Lady Bird went home empty-handed.This year’s nominations were read out by actors Terry Crews, Leslie Mann, Christian Slater and Danai Gurira they were joined on stage by Isan Elba, daughter of Idris and this year’s Golden Globe ambassador. The ceremony will take place on 7 January and be co-hosted by Oh (nominated for Killing Eve) and Andy Samberg, whose appointments were announced on Wednesday.This year’s Oscars host was revealed the day before, but the choice of Kevin Hart has met with a mixed reception as his history of apparent homophobia came to light. The Academy Awards will take place on 24 February.• This article was amended on 6 December to correct the spelling of Danai Gurira and a picture caption that mislabelled Christian Slater as Christian Bale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3399f9144230b4fc9b4685d4fbb081c3762e5104/0_99_2596_1558/master/2596.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8676eb118cbcf978028d5d6a48a00ff3","title":"movie santa clauses ranked","story":"Ten of the best Hollywood Kris Kringles, from Jim Broadbent (twice) and Billy Bob Thornton to Richard Attenborough and Gene HackmanFor the veteran supporting actor – who would go on to play a certain big Lebowski – this must have seemed like a welcome headlining role, even if the plot revolves round Dudley Moore’s wide-eyed elf being seduced by capitalism. Still, Huddleston brings bags of earthy jollity.In this plucky but overlooked Britcom, a crash-landed Santa gets banged up by mistake. Can ex-con Rafe Spall break him out in time to save Christmas? A never-cuddlier Broadbent twinkles in both full red-and-white regalia and drab prison denims.In the best of the contract-focused festive franchise, Santa must leave the north pole to find a wife – long story – so clones himself to keep toy production ticking over. It’s a double role for Allen who gets to show his range and, when the pair fall out, punch himself in the face.The perma-stoned H\u0026ampK movies have a very loose grasp on reality so when a jovial but sly Santa turns up – in the form of stocky character actor Riehle – it seems perfectly plausible that he made it his mission to reunite these estranged buddies via a giant spliff.In this animated fantasy, Saint Nick assembles an Avengers-style superteam of childhood icons to battle a nightmare king. A likeable festive berserker, this Santa boasts “Naughty” and “Nice” sleeve tattoos, wields dual sabres and has Baldwin doing a truly go-for-broke Russian accent.So, have you been naughty or nice? If it’s the former, Hackman’s tenacious stakeout Santa will chase you down a street, beat you with a cosh from his boot and then baffle you into spilling your guts by asking if you’ve ever been to Poughkeepsie.Netflix’s latest attempt to monopolise the Christmas movie market is a dud overall, but Russell channels every ounce of his square-jawed charisma to embody a swaggering Santa with a red leather jacket who does a mean Elvis impression.Technically, Jim Broadbent voices Santa in Aardman’s crammed CGI fable. But the real standout is Nighy, who drops his usual effortless urbanity to play the cackling, gurning Santa Sr, who helps his gormless grandkid save Christmas the old-fashioned way.The original bawdy ballad of Willie Stokes – a selfish career criminal who dons the fur-trimmed costume for an annual scam – remains surprisingly heartwarming without ever becoming too treacly, the perfect vehicle for Thornton’s ratbag charm.Disreputable Santas who subvert the jolly stereotype can be fun but sometimes you just want a crinkly Kringle with half-moon glasses and a white beard who can remind everyone – even lawyers! – about the magic of Christmas. Purists might prefer the 1947 original, but the visually rich 1994 remake bathes the avuncular Attenborough in a warm glow and really makes that red suit pop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/208d00c732eeed823ec55afe35faf252843e0c59/0_47_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=738e26931b4ba9f19e3a961be06086ad","title":"schindlers list 25th anniversary steven spielberg holocaust","story":"A big-screen rerelease leads to a re-examination of the 1993 Oscar winner which had a profound effect on critics and audiencesTwenty-five years ago, Steven Spielberg brought out two of his best movies, in a matter of months. The films were poles apart in style and subject matter, and the process of completing one while shooting the other left the director exhausted and emotionally ragged. In spring 1993, Spielberg was in Poland, recreating the terror of the Kraków ghetto and the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp for Schindler’s List by day, and each night he was calling Industrial Light \u0026amp Magic in California to oversee the special effects for the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Spielberg’s friend Robin Williams would call him up once a week to tell him jokes for 15 minutes at a time and release the tension.Spielberg pulled off a similar double recently when he shot the political drama The Post in the midst of post-production for his blockbuster spectacle Ready Player One. With Schindler’s List in 1993, Spielberg couldn’t bear the thought of delaying the production of his Holocaust passion project for another year. With The Post, he felt that the story’s resonances with the current political climate were too urgent to wait. Likewise, the trailer for the 25th anniversary rerelease of Schindler’s List rings with the words “Now more than ever”.By 1993, Schindler’s List had been on Spielberg’s desk for a decade. He was first given a copy of Thomas Keneally’s book after completing ET the Extra-Terrestrial in 1982. Keneally’s book is a novelized version of a true story: how a German industrialist and Nazi named Oskar Schindler managed to save 1,200 Jews from transportation to concentration camps. It’s a gruelling tale, and Schindler is not a conventional hero. He sets out as a profiteer, buying a former Jewish business in the Kraków ghetto, and exploiting Jewish labour to make enamelware to sell to the German army. As the war continues, Schindler can no longer stomach the regime and is moved to save a group of Polish Jews from the gas chambers. It’s a brave and righteous act, but one that pales in comparison to the scope of the Nazi atrocity. Nevertheless, a title card at the end of Spielberg’s adaptation informs that in 1993, as a result of the Shoah, there were only 4,000 Jews living in Poland, but around the world, there were more than 6,000 descendants of the Jews saved by Schindler. As is also shown in the film, the men and women that Schindler protected present him with a ring inscribed with words from the Talmud: “Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.”Spielberg shot his adaptation for a comparatively small budget of around $22m (about a third of the cost of Jurassic Park), in black-and-white, and in 72 days. Schindler was played by Liam Neeson, then a little-known actor, whom Spielberg had admired in Anna Christie on Broadway. Ben Kingsley played the crucial role of Itzhak Stern, Schindler’s Jewish accountant, who envisages the factory as a sanctuary from the camps long before his employer does. Ralph Fiennes, a relative newcomer at the time, played Amon Göth, the film’s snarling, sadistic villain – a grotesque SS officer who oversees the Płaszów camp, taking potshots at the workers from his balcony. The film’s story is as much about Schindler’s moral journey from complacent and mercenary womaniser to compassionate rescuer, from Göth to Stern, as wider Holocaust history. Cinematic flourishes such as picking out the coat of one little girl fleeing the SS in red become the dramatic signposts in this ethical transformation. She is both a lift from Keneally, who describes Schindler breaking down after seeing a girl in red, which gives him a clearer understanding of the scope of the Nazi scheme, and a nudge to the viewer, picking out one victim among thousands.Schindler views the girl in red from a distance, when he surveys the liquidation of the ghetto from a hilltop. Along with the bleak dramatic irony common to many war films (the Jews frequently assert that things can’t get worse), one of the film’s dominant strategies is a conscious discretion over the amount of screen violence. First one or two are killed (symbolically, the first is a disabled man, as those with disabilities were first to be targeted by the Nazis) and then more and more, until we are faced with the terrible sight of ash falling like snow across Kraków, a sickening mass grave, and the ferocious Auschwitz chimney. In interviews, Spielberg has discussed certain incidents that were deemed too obscene to be filmed. One of the film’s most gruelling scenes remains the attempted murder of a rabbi, which is thwarted by a jammed mechanism in Göth’s pistol.Schindler’s List is more than three hours long, and with such narrative care in Steve Zaillian’s screenplay, those accomplished lead performances, crisp and carefully lit cinematography by Janusz Kamiński and a sensitive John Williams score (featuring a violin theme by the Israeli American soloist Itzhak Perlman it is the definition of prestige cinema). Its sober tone seems to fold the unflinching testimony of Claude Lanzmann’s documentary Shoah into the hermetic narrative of a well-crafted novel, subjugating raw authenticity to emotional immediacy and the solace of a redemption story: a tactic that found a wide and generally appreciative audience. Schindler’s List was admiringly reviewed, recouped more than 10 times its budget at the box office and took home seven of the 12 Oscars it was nominated for, including best adapted screenplay, best picture and best director.Before Schindler’s List, Holocaust cinema had been dominated by documentary, most notably Lanzmann’s Shoah and Alain Resnais’s Night and Fog, but after Schindler’s List, it seemed that a slew of narrative features were released, including Life is Beautiful, The Pianist and The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. But can a movie really begin to address enormity of the Holocaust? Especially a Hollywood film, and one such as this, which dwells on the heroism of a gentile capitalist, arguably above the suffering of the Jews? Stanley Kubrick, who had his own never-realised Holocaust project in the works, is said to have been doubtful. “Think that was about the Holocaust?” he reportedly said. “That was about success, wasn’t it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler’s List was about 600 people who don’t.” Still, historian Peter Novick has identified Schindler’s List, together with Shoah and the 1993 opening of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC, as key events in the creation of what he calls “Holocaust consciousness”. Not only does the movie bear witness to the events such as the vicious liquidation of the ghetto, but also becomes a memorial of its own via the controversial coda, in which survivors from Schindler’s factory lay stones on his grave arm-in-arm with the actors who played them.For Spielberg, telling Schindler’s story was a tool to combat ignorance, but it is work that continues. After making the film, he recorded the testimony of many thousands more Holocaust survivors in a video project called Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation. Keneally himself had first heard about Schindler from one of the men saved, Leopold Page, who would tell his tale to the customers in his Beverly Hills luggage shop, hoping that the word would get out. Via Keneally, and then Spielberg, it reached the widest possible audience – and now the film returns to our screens just when we need to hear this story the most."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc0039574e40d3604cefb780c1733c0dad47c22/0_78_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f5864d395aac2cc611090824566c2a7","title":"the miracle of sissy spacek why its time to rediscover her genius","story":"She stars in The Old Man \u0026amp the Gun, but all the film’s publicity has been about Robert Redford. Anyone who hasn’t encountered her earlier performances is in for a treatTroubling news just in of a well-known comic in his early 30s, who approached a friend of mine at a party and squinted at his T-shirt. “What does that say?” he asked. “S-I-S-S-Y S-P-A-C-E-K?” (It was one of those Girls on Tops-style affairs, with the name of a female actor or film-maker emblazoned in capital letters.) An explanation, including the words “Carrie” and “Badlands” and possibly “acting legend”, was forthcoming, but the baffled celebrity was none the wiser. Could it be that the miracle of Sissy Spacek has eluded an entire generation?Spacek’s pace has admittedly slowed down in the past decade. Her last Oscar nomination was 16 years ago, for her performance as a grieving mother in the revenge drama In the Bedroom. She was a regular a few years back on Bloodline, a Netflix smash full of noirish foreboding and corkscrew twists, in which she played Mum to bad boy Ben Mendelsohn. And now she is in The Old Man \u0026amp the Gun, AKA the Robert Redford Retirement Movie, where she shows off her flirting abilities, her translucent and infinitely freckled skin, and even one of her own off-screen catchphrases, “Keep on keepin’ on,” all the while seeming vaguely underused.Spacek’s characteristic pensiveness is also on display in the new film. She can be vividly in the moment – think of her as the woman fighting to find her husband in Missing, set during the 1973 Chilean coup d’état – but her default setting is contemplation. Few actors can look so fascinating staring into space. As the country and western singer Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner’s Daughter, the film that won her the best actress Oscar, she has plenty of reason to gaze into the middle distance, imagining a life that would lift her out of hardship. The British director Michael Apted, who knew the value of patience from his work on the seminal Up documentary series, kept coming back to that face. You would offer more than a penny for her thoughts.That was 1980. But she had been brilliant right off the bat seven years earlier in Terrence Malick’s debut Badlands, an intoxicatingly lyrical real-life crime drama about a dopey killer, Kit (Martin Sheen), and his teenage girlfriend, Holly, played by Spacek at her dreamiest and most distracted. Character and actor, both Texan, became fused at a molecular level. “People who’ve worked with Terry either love him or hate him,” Spacek recalled. “I love him. We’d spend hours talking about things, and then the next day I’d look at the rewrites, and there’d be all the things I told him.” She said she could twirl batons and, sure enough, there it was in black and white the next day: “Holly twirls a baton.”Badlands was an interminable shoot, with the whimsical Malick prone to abandon the day’s schedule whenever he became distracted by this sunset or that river, taking off to film over there instead. Crew members quit. (The movie has three credited cinematographers.) But Spacek and the production designer Jack Fisk stuck it out. “I had a vested interest,” said Fisk. “I’d fallen in love with Sissy, so that also kept me going.” (The couple are still married.) Although her acting career was fully underway, she could be found helping out on Fisk’s jobs: she held the clapperboard on David Lynch’s Eraserhead and decorated sets on Brian De Palma’s gaudy horror-comedy Phantom of the Paradise.De Palma used her on Carrie for more than just her knack with an undercoat. For her luminous performance as the pale, terrified schoolgirl waking up to her terrifying powers, Spacek got the first of her six best actress Oscar nominations. The contorted poses she strikes during her telekinetic episodes – like a mix of kabuki and voguing – came from studying the dramatic biblical drawings that formed part of her husband’s research for his production design on the film.Carrie marked the start of her celebrity but also an end of sorts. She could pass for a teenager until she was almost 30 – she was 27 when she played Carrie – but during the 1980s she graduated to adult roles, including a run of rural dramas such as The River, Places in the Heart and the unsettling Raggedy Man. Even her smallest parts are comprised of fine, tender brushstrokes: one of her best is as the shy, stammering Rose in David Lynch’s The Straight Story. She doesn’t have more than 10 minutes of screentime, but her compassion and chiming sadness resonate throughout the picture.Spacek can also be blissfully dotty. She provides the voice of Anne Uumellmahaye, the brain with which Steve Martin becomes smitten in The Man With Two Brains (he takes her out on a rowboat and slaps a pair of wax lips on her jar). And she matches Christopher Walken quirk-for-quirk in Blast from the Past, where they play a couple who have been holed up in a fallout shelter for 35 years.As extraordinary as Badlands, Carrie and Coal Miner’s Daughter remain, I would point the oblivious and the unbelieving in the direction of the most spaced-out Spacek movie: Robert Altman’s eerie 3 Women. The film’s first half, with Spacek as the timid, impressionable Pinky being bossed around and jollied along by her garrulous roommate (Shelley Duvall), is the closest thing US cinema has produced to a Mike Leigh-style comedy of social awkwardness. In the second half, identities become blurred and exchanged, and those of us previously reassured by Spacek’s sweetness start to lose our bearings as the characters lose their marbles. For all the havoc Carrie wreaks, she is always sympathetic she only kills when cornered. But 3 Women, released only a year later in 1977, hinted at parts of Spacek that might be unknowable, even duplicitous. That face could never again seem purely placid.The Old Man \u0026amp the Gun is on general release"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cd21fed4f6390ebc6efa522871c7ac6a73e716b/1656_555_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47c870f6a08d6f5ac97bf95795059ee8","title":"frenkie de jong ajax manchester city barcelona","story":"“It’s crazy when people like you come all the way from England,” Frenkie de Jong says with a sincerity that suggests he really is struggling to understand why anyone would board a plane just to interview him.De Jong offers a bashful smile and for a moment it almost feels as if he has a point as we sit in the noisy canteen at Ajax’s training ground. Maybe it is time to stop the tape and give this pleasant young man some space.There is a good reason for making the journey, though, not to mention something disarming about meeting a rising talent who seems tickled by the hype surrounding him. On a light Amsterdam afternoon, De Jong’s modesty shines through. He is reassuringly normal for a 21‑year‑old who has been called – deep breath now – the new Johan Cruyff, the new Franz Beckenbauer and the future of Dutch football. Barcelona are linked with him on a daily basis but Manchester City also want a new midfield technician.Some say De Jong is a No 6, some a No 8. Others view him as a No 10, because he treats the ball like his oldest friend, and he has also been likened to Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard after impressing as a sweeper. But it is the comparisons with Cruyff that make him most uncomfortable.“I feel honoured,” De Jong says. “But I don’t think you can compare the two of us. He is so much better than me. He had so much quality. I will never reach that level. I don’t want to compare myself to Cruyff. And I think people who do that don’t want me to compare to Cruyff, they just see similarities in us. But not the same qualities. I watch his videos and he was amazing the way he moved with the ball, the way he saw the game.”De Jong’s caution is understandable. Plenty of self‑proclaimed future Ballon d’Or winners have made life difficult for themselves by talking too much and he is determined not to fall into that trap. It is a long climb to the top.They already adore him in Amsterdam, though. Even people without any interest in football have heard of De Jong, who is revered for his passing, skill and footballing intellect. He is incredibly brave on the ball, which tends to go down well in the Netherlands. This proud football nation has fallen on hard times, failing to qualify for the last two major tournaments, but De Jong’s emergence is one of the reasons why they have fresh hope. Having finished above Germany and France in their Nations League group, Ronald Koeman’s young side will be England’s semi-final opponents at next summer’s finals.De Jong oozed composure when he made his full international debut in the 2-1 away defeat to France three months ago. Typically he corrects a story about Kylian Mbappé asking for his shirt after the game, insisting he initiated the swap with the France forward.Ajax, who have reached the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time in 13 years, have embraced his talent. Erik ten Hag’s side are in the midst of a romantic resurgence – Ajax will win their group if they beat Bayern Munich on Wednesday – and De Jong gets why people see Cruyff’s spirit in him.“Normally midfielders only pass the ball but I dribble as well,” he says. “People say I take a lot of risks but I don’t think I do, because I don’t lose possession that much.”“Yeah,” he says. “Since I was young I played like this. I don’t think it’s good to become less of what I am now. I have come to the first team playing the way I did when I was a kid. Why change now? Some people say you have to play mature football but the way Lionel Messi plays is mature football as well. He’s just too good for everyone. He can just dribble past them and it looks like his opponents are the kids.“When I am on the pitch I play on intuition but I think a lot about the game as well. With my intuition, it is not just that I receive the ball and always think ‘I’m going to do this’ straight away, even though it just happens that way sometimes.“Most good players play on intuition. Everyone has a little but I don’t know if you can learn it. Sometimes I’m planning. I’m always searching for the pass. I’m always looking to see my teammate. ‘Is he free?’ Then you already know what to do. But sometimes the situation can change. Then you have to react and use your intuition. I try to have a picture when I receive the ball and know where everyone is. That’s one of the most important things for a midfielder.”De Jong’s passion is obvious. He was always playing when he was growing up in Arkel, a village in South Holland, and was never glued to his phone. He joined Ajax at the age of 15.- Born in Cameroon, he played for the Samuel Eto’o Foundation before joining Barcelona as a 13-year-old. Onana joined Ajax in 2015 and has played almost 100 times for the first team, winning a first senior cap in 2016. Barça and Tottenham are reported to have shown an interest in signing him.- Signed from Rapid Vienna in 2017, Wöber initially struggled to replace Dávinson Sánchez but has started to show his potential as De Ligt’s defensive partner. “I will never be a Sergio Ramos: the bad boy on the field,” he said. “But no one has to fear that I’m afraid.”\u0026nbsp- Made his senior debut for the Netherlands in 2017 having made only two Ereisie appearances for Ajax, whom he joined at the age of nine. Now has 11 caps and is considered one of the best young defenders in the world, with Bayern Munich and Barcelona among the big clubs keeping tabs on him.\u0026nbsp- The attacking right-back was born in the Netherlands but – like teammate Hakim Ziyech – has decided to represent Morocco despite holding talks with Oranje manager Ronald Koeman. Now established as a first‑choice for Erik ten Hag having come through the Jong Ajax system.- Another homegrown product, Van\u0026nbspde Beek began in Ajax’s D team but made his first-team debut in 2015 at the age of 18 and reportedly turned down a move to Roma in the summer. Comfortable in all three midfield positions in Ajax’s customary 4-3-3 formation, he scored 11 league goals last season.- The first recipient of\u0026nbsp the Abdelhak Nouri Trofee, which recognises the best player in the academy, in September the Dutch teenager beat Clarence Seedorf’s record in as the youngest-ever player to appear for Ajax in the Ereisie at just 16 years and 130 days.- Moved to Ajax in January 2017 from São Paulo and broke into the senior side almost immediately. Usually deployed on the right of the front three, the Brazilian scored 14 league goals last season and has attracted interest from Borussia Dortmund and Manchester United despite signing a new deal in September.- Has provoked comparisons with Dennis Bergkamp because of his ice-cool temperament. The Denmark international struggled last season after making his breakthrough in Ajax’s run to the 2017 Europa League final but seems to be finding his form again under Ten Hag.“I like to watch the great players, the ones who are technically good and understand the game,” De Jong says. “I try to see how they move. There are so many I look at, especially the midfielders. You have the guys from Barcelona, the guys from Manchester City. Jorginho at Chelsea now. There are so many to learn from.”Has he seen the criticism Jorginho has received in England for failing to protect Chelsea’s defence this season? “You have to tackle as well,” De Jong says. “You have to do your defensive work but I like to see players who understand the game, players with a lot of vision. Jorginho is one of them.”He cannot hide his admiration for Guardiola’s great Barça side and says Messi is the best because he can do everything. “I love this style. Get the ball back quickly, then play possession with so many combinations. When you watch that, you get the feeling you want to go out on the pitch and play football with your friends and just enjoy yourself. City and Barcelona are great examples.”De Jong has come into his own in the last two years. He was a late substitute when Manchester United beat Ajax 2-0 in the Europa League final in 2017, José Mourinho’s counterattacking tactics cutting through Ajax’s high press. The coach, Peter Bosz, left for Borussia Dortmund shortly after taking them to that first European final in 21 years and after a brief spell with Marcel Keizer in charge, Ten Hag took over in December 2017.Ten Hag knows Guardiola after spending two years as Bayern Munich’s second-team manager. De Jong has enjoyed learning from the 48-year-old and praises his “positive energy” and “great football vision”.The mood is optimistic but beneath the surface uncertainty lingers. Ajax are producing players, with youngsters such as the goalkeeper André Onana, Donny van de Beek, David Neres and Kasper Dolberg catching the eye, but they have not won the league since 2014 and are two points behind PSV Eindhoven at the top of the Ereisie. They have lost Justin Kluivert, Davinson Sánchez and Davy Klaassen in the last two years and there is relentless speculation over Matthijs de Ligt, the elegant 19-year-old centre-back, and De Jong.“It’s difficult to say what will happen,” De Jong says. “I want to finish this season well with Ajax. Then we will see. Maybe I’ll stay for another year, maybe I’ll leave. But I am not sure.”One day it’s Barcelona, the next it’s City. De Jong laughs. “I don’t pay attention to it,” he says. “I hear the stories but I just want to finish this season well.”We talk about Ajax winning three consecutive European Cups in the 1970s and a fourth in 1995. De Jong accepts it will be hard for the current side to recreate those glory days but he is relaxed about the interest in his every move. “I’m just me,” he says. “I try to be kind to everyone. I feel pressure to win but when I am on the pitch I don’t think: ‘Oh, I’m not playing well, the media is going to hammer me.’”We head outside and our photographer tells De Jong he has a lovely smile. His face reddens a little and I tell him he smiles a lot. “I want to enjoy life,” he says. “Be happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32db81abca2b1f75656e384b734ae045a6d2738b/0_85_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a5b45746b52574113c18214aaa35a3","title":"west ham fan supporters board democratic football lads alliance","story":"A representative on West Ham’s newly formed official supporters’ board has placed the club in an awkward position after expressing support for the Democratic Football Lads Alliance, a group condemned by anti-racism campaigners.Greg Smith, who was present when the 18-member OSB held its first meeting with Karren Brady, West Ham’s vice-chairman, and other club officials last week, was asked by the  whether his attendance at October’s DFLA march in London was compatible with his position as a fan representative.Smith, a season-ticket holder at the London Stadium, replied: “I did attend the march in October. I’m opposed to acts of terrorism as a political means of effecting change and marched on that basis.”Smith has previously expressed support for Mark Phillips, the West Ham Under-18s coach, who also attended the march. The club suspended Phillips and held an investigation to determine whether his social media activity had broken club rules. He returned to his role in the academy last month after West Ham found there were not sufficient grounds to sack him. They had taken external legal advice from employment specialists.“We were protesting about better treatment for homeless old soldiers as much as Islamic extremism,” Smith told the Sun in October. “I don’t know Mark Phillips but it makes him look like a condemned man before he has a fair trial. The suspension has been a big topic among a lot of West Ham fans who think it’s too much, too soon.”Smith’s comments raise troubling questions for West Ham. The DFLA, a group formed of mainly middle-aged, white, male football fans, had planned a mass march from Park Lane to Whitehall. Organisers said on Facebook they were protesting against “returning jihadists”, “thousands of Awol migrants”, “rape gangs and groomers” and “veterans treated like traitors”. The demonstration descended into violence when anti-racism protesters attempted to block the DFLA’s route. There is no suggestion Smith was involved in any disturbances.The DFLA has been accused of spreading Islamophobia and of having links with far-right organisations. It was set up after the London Bridge terror attack in 2017, has called itself an anti-extremist group and has received support from Tommy Robinson, the former leader of the English Defence League. The Premier League warned clubs about the DFLA’s growing presence inside stadiums this year.Smith, who is on the OSB to represent 1966 season-ticket holders, also has links with the Real West Ham Fans Group, which was set up last season by Andy Swallow and Micky Morgan, the founder members of the infamous unofficial Inter City Firm. West Ham were accused of failing to respond appropriately after the RWHFG orchestrated an online campaign against the former head of West Ham United Independent Supporters’ Association, a rival fan group.The RWHFG and WHUISA were part of a coalition of 15 fan groups that held meetings with Brady to discuss supporter discontent earlier this year. Smith is one of 18 members on the official supporters’ board, which was set up to improve dialogue with the club following unrest over West Ham’s decision to leave Upton Park for the London Stadium. WHUISA has declined to take part. asked West Ham whether it was appropriate for Smith to remain on the OSB given his support for the DFLA and to explain the process that led to representatives being selected by an independent panel of four, which included Sir Trevor Brooking. The club did not answer questions regarding whether it conducted background checks or reserved the right to veto members.A West Ham spokesperson said: “Members of the official supporters’ board are not appointed by the club, but by an independent panel. The process was open and available to all supporters to apply and applications were anonymised and scored by an independent panel and representatives selected by them. The supporters receiving the highest score in each area were selected as a supporter representative. We do not comment on inidual members.”West Ham received a complaint from a supporter about Smith’s place on the new board last week. A member of supporter services responded: “Panel members were chosen based on their backgrounds within football, supporter experience or because they possessed great knowledge and passion for West Ham.”A spokesman for Hope Not Hate, an anti-racism group, called on West Ham to respond appropriately. “It’s disappointing,” Matthew Collins said. “Perhaps he should have made known to the people electing him that he attended a far-right demonstration. We hope the board at West Ham treat this very seriously. West Ham say they are a proud and inclusive club and that doesn’t appear to be the case with the DFLA.”Smith has stated his aim is to be “a conduit between supporters and the club so there’s a measured and manageable dialogue at all times”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90cdf66425c706d2a2a731cbba48992bc661afee/0_180_3706_2224/master/3706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac26912d8d5bcdf8abc5bf2c6dbb680f","title":"stalemate at old trafford and wolves at chelseas door football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Amy Lawrence and Mike Calvin discuss ‘four crap goals’ in the game between Manchester United and Arsenal, Morgan Gibbs-White, a very strange game in Brighton, the French for ‘putting your foot in it’ and sprinting managersJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

She sparkles. And she’s made by women paid just 1p for each doll that shimmers off shop shelves.This Christmas, tens of thousands of children the world over will excitedly tear the wrapping paper off an Ariel doll – Disney’s Little Mermaid – secure in the knowledge that it was made for them by Santa’s happy elves at the north pole.The reality would come as a cruel surprise. For elves, read Chinese factory workers. For the north pole, read the city of Heyuan. And for happy, read miserable – from illegally long working hours and exhaustion to wages too low to support a family.An investigation published on Thursday by rights groups Solidar Suisse and China Labor Watch, in partnership with the , found evidence of excessive and illegal overtime, basic pay rates as low as 85p an hour, no holiday or sick pay and high levels of exhaustion among the largely female workforce making Disney toys and products for other international toy companies including Mattel’s Fisher Price brand.Workers reported being fined or dismissed if they took three or more days off sick.Staff at the Wah Tung factory in the city of Heyuan said that they worked 175 hours of overtime in a month, with only one day off over that period – both breaches of Chinese labour law and toy industry codes of conduct.Heyuan is a city of roughly 3 million people in Guangdong province, south-east China.It is home to Wah Tung (Heyuan) Toy Manufacturing Ltd, where about 2,000 workers produce a range of mainly plastic toys and electronics.The Princess Sing \u0026amp Sparkle Disney Ariel doll, selling for £34.99, is made here. Many online stores have sold out of stock and are awaiting a fresh delivery a few days before Christmas.At the peak of production, in late summer, as many as 2,400 of the dolls were rolling off the Wah Tung production line each day.The doll comes with a mane of deep red hair and a glittery tail that acts like a snow globe. In the last quarter it helped Disney’s consumer products ision to an operating income of £264m on revenue of £880m.But the investigation found that, when costs were broken down, each of the women on the production line was receiving just 1p for every doll produced.*The investigator joined the Sing \u0026amp Sparkle assembly line for a month during the summer. From her own experience and interviews with fellow workers, she found daily overtime varied between two and five hours and that, with weekends included, overtime would sometimes hit 175 hours a month – nearly five times the legal limit of 36 hours.In low season, workers earned about 2,000 Chinese yuan a month (£228) during peak season, they generally took home about 3,000 yuan. A survey last year put the average Chinese monthly salary at 7,665 yuan.Workers were expected to arrive 10 minutes before the start of their shifts many reported feeling excessively tired because of the long hours. Photographs from the production lines show workers asleep or resting during breaks.In her diary, the investigator noted: “At 5pm, the worker behind me said she felt so tired that her back was sore. She wanted to sleep so badly but couldn’t, since our shift wasn’t over yet. She wondered why was time going by so slowly. I said that I also felt time was going by very slowly. When you’re constantly doing the same thing over and over again, you start to feel dizzy and your vision becomes blurry.”She also noted that most of her colleagues were women over the age of 45 who were drawn to the work because they were “poorly educated, well-behaved, obedient, and care more about children and family”. Factories like them because “they are less likely to make trouble and easier to manage” than men, she wrote.“There were a lot of female workers at the toy factory and some of them were older. So, when they worked, they needed to wear reading glasses. They worked very carefully and quickly, but some of the time, the line leader would say they worked too slowly or would yell at them. Whenever the female workers were being yelled at, they would never say a word in return and would silently continue working on the task at hand.”Simone Wasmann, from Solidar Suisse, urged toy companies to share some of their profits with workers.“Children love Disney’s toys but we want their parents to understand that there’s no Christmas magic going on here: those toys were made with cheap labour by women working illegally long hours for pennies.“For them, it is just day after day of misery. They don’t work in those factories long into the night because they want to: they do that because it is the only way they can make enough money to live.”Many of the biggest toy makers – including Disney and Mattel – are members of the International Council of Toy Industries Ethical Toy Program, which sets out expected industry standards intended, the body says, to improve working conditions in toy factories.The Wah Tung factory is certified by the ETP. Speaking on the factory’s behalf, ETP spokesman Mark Robertson said: “The allegations highlighted from the CLW report contravene ethical toy programme’s own requirements on working hours, wages, holiday pay and annual leave. We will work directly with factories to address any issues identified.“We take the issues raised by China Labor Watch very seriously and have launched our own investigation. We will quickly and effectively address any issues identified which are in breach of our standards.”Robertson said that the ETP had achieved substantive progress in raising ethical conditions at the organisation’s certified factories in China and elsewhere. “Wages have increased, factory environments are safer and working hours are reducing hours worked at toy factories in China are lower than those in the apparel and electronic sectors.”A spokesman for Disney said the brand was a member of the ethical toy programme’s committed brands plus programme, which it used alongside others “as part of our responsible sourcing approach”.He referred to a statement from ETP in which the council said it welcomed “any robust investigation which increases our understanding of working conditions at toy factories”.Mattel said it had no current production in the factories mentioned in the CLW report.“Mattel is committed to ensuring every single person making our toys and products is treated fairly, with respect, and is able to work in a safe and healthy environment. Our labour standards, environmental, health and safety programmes and oversight processes reflect this commitment, and we stand behind our record of ethical labour practices and environmental stewardship.”Three other factories producing for a large number of international brands feature in the full report.* This figure represents the total monthly wages of the 36 women on the production line, working an average of 26 days a month, ided by the total number of dolls produced each month"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b79559668f7ad136d222dcd36c15c0b30ec3d6f/0_0_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efee944098ff5f2ca24a81b6ca7be6a6","title":"fir crying out loud share your photos of the worst christmas trees","story":"After the White House caused seasonal smirks with its latest offering, we want to see more seasonal decoration failsLike it or not, Black Friday has come and gone and with December approaching, Christmas is on the horizon.

Alas, it was not to be …Has Milo Yiannopoulos not thought of doing panto? I am moved to ask after documents surfaced this week revealing the level of the fallen provocateur’s debts, and the level of his inability to handle it. He’d make a serviceable Abanazar, emerging from stage smoke in Kettering to a barrage of sweets thrown by small children. Indeed, with the right direction and a willingness to commit more fully to his Joe Wicks DVD, he could even be a Buttons.However outraged Milo may currently feel about his diminished star status, we should remind him that Christmas theatre has always been a friend to performers who have been forced – forced! – to send email laments along the lines of: “This weekend I returned my wedding ring to Cartier to wipe out my outstanding debt to them.”The latter is but one highlight of an exchange between Milo and the organisers of his cancelled Australian tour, in documents obtained by Hope Not Hate. Milo appears to have treated the promoters as a cash line, as well as the only guests at his pity party. At one point, they reluctantly offer to wire him money for “living expenses ie to keep food on the table”, only for him to shoot back that he “will have no way of paying my cleaning lady or paying back the loan from my phone bill. These are not optional expenses … You must pay my doctor and you must do it now … At an absolute bare minimum I need you to pay two months rent …” Blahdy-blahdy-blah. It goes on.The specifics of Milo’s debts illuminate the realities of the politico-intellectual struggle in which he has been such a … leading light, is it? For instance, he claims to owe $52,016.14 to the Hualalai Four Seasons resort in Hawaii. The CEO of Milo Inc states he owes $1.6m to Milo Inc. Milo himself estimates his personal debts at $496,123.04.As for the tour itself, it was due to take place this month, during which he would have shared top billing with fellow rightwing provocateur Ann Coulter at events including a “VIP yacht cruise” with the pair on the Gold Coast. Alas, this just wasn’t meant to be. The Australian promoters have finally pulled the plug on it, breaking cover this week to speak to Australian reporters. “It’s been the worst six months of my life,” one of them told a TV news reporter. “He’s a nightmare.”Yes. If only there’d been some way of suspecting this in advance. The pair seem rather surprised that a man famous for doxxing people has this week doxxed them in retaliation. For his part, Milo has gone full crystal-tipped King Lear, promising the cancellation will provoke “a class-action lawsuit on behalf of my fans”. I am reminded of a recent bloviation of his I read, in which he reflected bitterly on some perceived slight by Jordan Peterson. “Peter denied Jesus,” railed Milo, “just as his nominative descendant Peterson has denied me and others.” Waa waa waa.As I say, would a stint in seasonal entertainment not take his and his bank manager’s mind off things? Then again, in many ways, that was what he was planning with this trip to Australia.Over the past year or so, Australia has become the equivalent of panto for the alt-rightradical rightfar right. You do a few lucrative weeks there you tell the audiences you love them even as you scream backstage for the hand sanitiser you get the first plane out and tell yourself your dignity is intact. It’ll be the Palladium next year, and your agent is bound to call with a slot on Fox Nation soon.Nigel Farage visited the country a few months ago, selling tickets at up to $100 (£55) for a series of lectures entitled An Entertaining Evening With Nigel Farage. Entertainments included Nigel explaining his stepfather’s uncle had fought with the Anzacs and got a VC, Nigel explaining that he was the most popular politician in the UK and Nigel nicking his mate’s material and leading the crowd in a “lock her up!” chant. Unfortunately, he didn’t mention Robert Mueller, denying the audience the opportunity to shriek: “HE’S BEHIND YOU!”So that was Nigel. Then there was Ann and Milo, but once they’d pulled the plug on that gig series, for the reasons detailed above, the promoters attempted to persuade punters that they’d much rather see the new speaking tour double act they’d booked instead: Ukip spad Tommy Robinson and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes.Mmm. Attending a Tommy Robinson speaking engagement feels a lot like attending a giraffe swimming engagement. Amusing at some level, but distressing in fairly short order. You’d feel more in the presence of a professional if you simply watched him commit mortgage fraud for an evening.Either way, even this replacement option has gone tits up. According to Tommy Robinson’s PA, he “cocked up his diary” and forgot he was leading a Brexit betrayal march this coming Sunday, as part of the festive programming we’re all so much enjoying at the moment. Meanwhile, McInnes’s visa has reportedly been turned down by Australia on grounds of “bad character”. However, according to those tireless promoters, the tour will go ahead next February, with punters asked to pay as much as $995 for “a preshow dinner … champagne reception and VIP seating”.I suppose there’s a rich tradition of champagne fascism. Even so, I’m not sure quite why Australia is allowing itself to be used as a piggy bank for distressed provocateurs. On a simple watchability level, it does seem such a waste of their vast collection of lethal wildlife. Why not release the Milos, Nigels and Tommies into it and film the results? It would be bigger than Home and Away and Neighbours combined."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3cb4e778233f103a9812e238e8712f5cafe0ebf/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33c744b5d1d6f9e05dc7bef262d3c0ec","title":"james review sse hydro glasgow","story":"SSE Hydro, GlasgowFronted by a prowling, prancing Tim Booth, James conjure mass singalongs and communal spiritMidway through a nearly two-hour set, James singer Tim Booth reveals that the narrow gangway he has been prowling and prancing along was originally supposed to be situated much further into the crowd. Apparently, health and safety intervened. “They were worried you might devour me,” he declares. “But sometimes I don’t mind being devoured.”With eight band members on stage and a back catalogue of 15 albums – including this year’s strident Living in Extraordinary Times – there is currently more James to feast on than ever, and in this case bigger is demonstrably better. The canny decision to team up with fellow indie veterans the Charlatans for a brief UK tour of jumbo-sized venues nudges the night into mini-festival territory, for a seasoned congregation equal parts rowdy and rapt.It is Booth’s swooping, decadent voice that helps sell the abundance of new tracks. Anything he does is inherently dramatic, so it is little wonder the 58-year-old is a sometime actor. With his shaven head and live-wire charisma, Booth could play anything from intense yoga instructor to terrifying Russian heavy. The audience certainly want a piece of his action: after an early runout for their shuffling 1997 hit Waltzing Along, he is pulled into the throng.Rather than try and calm things down, they then play Sit Down, a hit in 1991 and perhaps the first James song to confirm their gift for combining grand rock gestures with emotional communion. It creates a tangible charge that echoes throughout the rest of the set. They reach even deeper into their back catalogue to pull out Stutter, a reminder of the arty, angular James of the 1980s. It is a strident mirror-dimension version of These Boots Are Made for Walkin’ that builds toward drunk-tank guitar squall.That the material from Living in Extraordinary Times holds its own alongside such past glories is never less than impressive. They encore with new song Many Faces, a humanistic rallying cry that sparks a mass singalong with the speed of a miracle language-learning tape, before a climactic, triumphant Sometimes.

He said he would dedicate himself to creating a “Wales which is a beacon of hope in a darkening world”.His closeness to the UK Labour leader means he will come under scrutiny from political opponents in London as well as in Cardiff. Any problems the Welsh government faces or errors it makes could be used as ammunition to attack UK Labour and Corbyn.The leader of the Conservatives in the Welsh assembly, Paul Davies, said: “While Mark Drakeford has a mandate to lead from the Labour party, he has no mandate to lead from the Welsh people. Only a Welsh assembly election will provide an opportunity for the public to endorse, or otherwise, his plans.”He is on the centre left of the Welsh Labour party and was the only member of the then Welsh cabinet who voted for Corbyn in his first leadership bid in 2015.Drakeford used to work as special adviser for Morgan, one of the most charismatic Welsh politicians of recent years, who famously advocated “clear red water” between Welsh Labour and the UK party – then led by Tony Blair. Drakeford believes this ide is no longer needed.Brexit will, naturally, be top of Drakeford’s list of priorities, while on the domestic scene one of his first tasks will be to oversee a decision on a hugely controversial road programme – the plan to carve a new 14-mile stretch of motorway through the ancient Gwent Levels near Newport.He will also have to heal rifts in Welsh Labour following the death of Carl Sargeant, who was found dead four days after he was sacked amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour to women.Corbyn said: “I am confident that Mark will demonstrate what Labour in government can achieve by building a more equal society, even in the face of the Conservatives’ callous austerity agenda and cuts to the Welsh budget.“I know Mark will relentlessly fight for the interests of the Welsh people and stand up to the Tories’ chronic under-investment in Wales compared to other parts of the UK, particularly London.”At the conclusion of the process, all four party groups represented in the Welsh assembly – Labour, the Welsh Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and Ukip – will have changed leader during 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a93428b06ee11330cc444680081bd61950cb341e/0_1358_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e38ac0596c160a1d6924828d38c495e","title":"give six year olds the vote says cambridge university academic","story":"The head of politics at Cambridge University has called for children as young as six to be given the vote in an attempt to tackle the age bias in modern democracy.Prof David Runciman said the ageing population meant young people were now “massively outnumbered”, creating a democratic crisis and an inbuilt bias against governments that plan for the future.In the latest episode of his podcast, Talking Politics, he said lowering the voting age to 16 was not radical enough to address the problem.“What’s the worst that could happen? At least it would be exciting, it would make elections more fun. It is never going to happen in a million years but as a way of capturing just how structurally unbalanced our democracies have become, seriously, why not? Why not six-year-olds?Runciman added: “Old people are currently the coalition that have a huge inbuilt advantage in representative democratic politics.“Young people are massively outnumbered because the voting age is 18, whereas there isn’t a cutoff point at the other end. You don’t lose the vote when you get to be 75. You can carry on voting until the day you die and there is no test. You could be frankly demented and still get to vote, which is as it should be. So young people are the losers here.”He dismissed other suggestions for correcting this bias. “There are suggestions to introduce various kinds of gradation into it, maybe to give more votes to younger people and try to calibrate the vote so you rectify this imbalance. That’s all insane. You should never, never interfere with the basic principle of democracy, which is one person one vote. And you should never take votes away from people.”He added: “You get to vote right the way through to the end of your life regardless of whether you are capable of voting or not, and we are fine with that.”His recommendation comes from research for his new book, How Democracies End, which examines signs of how democracy is collapsing.“Young people are triply discriminated against,” he said. “If you are in your 20s, you are not represented in your parliament, you keep losing elections and you are expected to care about the future, the environment, the unborn – it is your job as a young person to somehow take up causes that old people are a little bit long in the tooth to worry about.”He argued that if the voting age was not lowered, politics would be left to “people who aren’t going to live into the future and can just care about the present”.Runciman suggested the Brexit vote might not have happened with a radically lower voting age.“If 16- or 17-year-olds voted in the 2017 general election, there is a chance that Jeremy Corbyn would now be prime minister … If 16- or 17-year-olds voted in the Brexit referendum, it would have been closer, but it probably still wouldn’t have been enough to overturn the result,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b6b2148dcdc22cb9335467008785c841980eb38/0_199_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fd259e78fd89ae6ace17795a787b4a7","title":"remain tory mp brexit clacton deal","story":"MP Giles Watling faces uphill task selling Theresa May’s Brexit deal to his constituents – and he hasn’t made up his own mind yetAs a remain-voting Conservative MP in one of only two places to ever send a Ukip representative to Westminster, Giles Watling faced an arguably uphill task anyway in selling Theresa May’s Brexit deal to his constituents in Clacton-on-Sea.But on this weekday afternoon walkabout there are more complications. First, the woman to whom Watling has begun his pitch inside a local hair salon is adamant she no longer listens to talk about Brexit. Then there is the small issue that the MP himself has not yet decided if he backs the prime minister’s plan.“I’m totally sick of it,” says Carol Kincaid, politely but firmly, her part-coloured hair in foils as she waits in a chair, the newly arrived Watling perched next to her. “When I hear the B-word, if it comes up on the radio, I go for the button so I can listen to music.”Tough audiences are nothing new to Watling, who was an actor and stage director before entering parliament in 2017, and is still probably the only politician to have pulled out of a touring production of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert to fight a byelection.He persists gently with Kincaid, but she is adamant: “I haven’t listened to the deal. I’m guilty of switching off. I don’t feel that people have any power with politicians. The banks and civil service run the country. Money runs the country.”Watling’s Essex constituency, which takes in prosperous districts as well as areas such as Jaywick, officially England’s most deprived neighbourhood, may not be typical of the fight to sell May’s Brexit plan to the masses, being disproportionately older and more pro-leave.But as Watling treks around the businesses and postwar bungalows of Burrsville, a mile or so north of the seafront, themes emerge that seem common nationally: people are bored of Brexit and want the process completed they admire May’s tenacity, but worry about her proposals.Watling, still known to some locals for playing an amiable vicar in the 1980s sitcom Bread, concurs: “There’s an enormous amount of people who just want it done, want some certainty, to get it over with. There is also a fear that we might inadvertently hand the keys of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn, just by not sorting it out.Watling’s mini-tour begins in the Robert Burre pub, a rare historic building in an area that was mainly countryside before the second world war. There, a representative from Heineken, the host brewery, quietly presses the MP on the need for business certainty.At the next table, the pub managers, Kelvin and Susan Davies, explain that talk of Brexit is rare among customers, the great majority of whom are – like the couple themselves – of retirement age. “They’re the only people around here with any money to spend,” says Kelvin, 72.He continues: “The vast majority of people, like myself, just wish it was over and done with, and we just get out. Ninety percent of our customers want to be out.“At the end of the day the consensus is: they’re scaremongering, they say we can never manage on our own. But we’re Great Britain, we managed for centuries on our own. We led the world. Why should we be afraid of going it alone now?”For all the gung-ho talk, Davies says he is reconciled to May’s plan, one that alarms most Brexiters in parliament: “I think Theresa May is doing a good job under the circumstances. There’s a lot of people against her at the moment, but she’s steering a good path. It seems the best deal we can get.”If this might sound reassuring for the prime minister, there is worse news when Watling starts knocking on doors in the surrounding houses, many occupied by people who left London and its suburbs for a quieter retirement – and cheaper property – by the coast.A woman who answers the door in a leopardskin onesie says she is still a supporter of Ukip, the party that represented Clacton after Douglas Carswell defected from the Conservatives in 2014, defeating Watling in the byelection, and then again in the 2015 election, before standing down.The woman, who gives her name only as Deborah, is scathing about the prospects for May’s departure plan: “The French will go on about fishing rights, the Spanish about Gibraltar, and all the nations in Europe have got to agree before they sign this off.”Watling tries to reassure her, but Deborah argues a no-deal Brexit is the only option: “I just want out. I voted to come out, simple as that. I don’t want to be tied to Europe at all. I’m not European. I’m English and I want our sovereignty back.”For all the vehemence, when asked about how May has performed, even Deborah concedes her respect – certainly when compared with the previous prime minister.“She seems strong. I don’t like the deal but I think she’s done pretty well. That Cameron – like what’s-his-name out of EastEnders said, he’s got on his trotters and run, and left us. Simple as that.”Watling says respect for May is a sentiment he hears from those holding more or less every shade of Brexit opinion: “Theresa May on a personal level has massive support. I think any vote of no confidence would fall immediately. And that’s why it hasn’t happened. Nobody wants the job, either. Who would want a job like that? You might agree or disagree with her position, but you can’t fault her for stamina or resilience.”It has already been an eventful few weeks for Watling. Last month the MP was driving home from London on a Thursday evening when an emergency call from the BBC saw him erted to the filming of that week’s Question Time in Clacton, after the Treasury secretary, Liz Truss, was stuck on a train. He jokes it is not the first time he has been an emergency understudy.Watling, 65, now faces the most taxing decision of his slightly unexpected late second career in national politics, when MPs vote on Tuesday on May’s deal.He has submitted his own amendment to the motion, seeking to reduce the potential scope of the European court of justice if the Northern Irish backstop plan comes into force.He says: “I speak as a remainer, who wouldn’t have done this in the first place, but if we’re going to go through all this pain and uncertainty, and at the end of it we don’t have sovereignty and the European court of justice has dominion over the backstop, then what’s been the point?”In the coming days Watling will face yet more competing demands from sceptical constituents and Conservative whips.He says: “I do get it in the neck from everybody, from all sides. That goes with the territory. But there is an enormous amount of pressure building to just sign the thing, get it sorted. I have my issues with it, but I’m really sympathetic.”Amid all this, Watling confirms, he has yet to decide whether to back the prime minister: “A week really is a long time in politics, and I think it’s foolish to declare your position this long before the event.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caf36bb221bfb0fc21f3b29cf76ffd0db0cfc3ec/0_94_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c930e7f4c9ce9107e6b4f47418bd1873","title":"the end of days draws nigh our maybots gone truly rogue","story":"Cover blown, her masterplan exposed, May is hellbent on ensuring she loses the Commons’ Brexit vote next TuesdayFor a while now, some of us in Westminster have been convinced that Theresa May is a sleeper agent whose mission is to undermine her own government. That conspiracy theory is now officially dead in the water. Because there is now nothing secretive about the prime minister’s actions. Her cover is well and truly blown. She is entirely open about using every opportunity to destroy her credibility.May has gone rogue. A one-woman Terminator whose systems are riddled with malware and who is hellbent on destroying everything around her. The government, the country, the universe. But most of all, herself.It’s long been axiomatic that the prime minister is at her most convincing when she is saying nothing at all. So her best chance of getting her Brexit deal through the Commons was always to hide under the duvet and watch Dynasties on her laptop.But at some point in the last few days, May has appeared to come to the astonishing conclusion that she actually has a hope of winning next Tuesday’s vote. Quite how she has come to that algorithmic impossibility is not clear – circuit overload is the most likely answer – but now the idea is in her head she is doing everything in her power to make sure it doesn’t become reality. Which is why she chose to spend her breakfast time giving a 20-minute interview to Radio 4’s Today programme.Here was the prime minister at her most Maybotic. Staccato, brittle and with a delivery that flatlined. She could not have sounded less enthusiastic about her deal if she had tried. It was a good deal because it was the only deal, she said in a dead monotone.Worried that she might be presenting herself as too coherent, May spent the last 15 minutes failing to give straight answers to straight questions, talking in meaningless soundbites and leaving everyone guessing as to whether she really had a strategy. If there had been anyone in favour of her deal at the start of the interview, there wasn’t by the end.Further evidence of May’s masterplan to undermine the country was on show at Brexit questions in the Commons. In its early days the Brexit department had a sense of national importance. Now it is nothing more than a sideshow, whose primary job is to try to make sure there are enough lorry parks in Kent in case the country grinds to a standstill on 30 March next year.Having already lost two Brexit secretaries in David Davis and Dominic Raab – no great loss, some might say – May has had to rustle up someone else to do the job.It hasn’t been easy. The Four Pot Plants declined to join the cabinet on the grounds that they were hopelessly overqualified. So the prime minister had to cast her net wider. In Stephen Barclay she made an inspired choice. Barclay is a man after her own heart. A man who can spend hours saying nothing meaningful. Though in his case he has little alternative as he doesn’t actually know anything meaningful. He is the nonentity’s nonentity. Brexit questions passed in a gentle haze of futility, while the few dozen MPs in the chamber dozed off. The radioactive isotopes Barclay is tasked with stockpiling have a longer half-life than his department.In the third day of the Brexit debate, Philip Hammond was talking down both the deal and the economy. He was very keen to keep his distance from the withdrawal agreement and future partnership by repeatedly referring to the deal as “the prime minister’s deal”. Nothing to do with me, guv. It was basically all a bit rubbish and everyone was going to be broke, but we’d be a bit less broke with “the prime minister’s” deal. Thanks.There were many interventions. Quite why Nadine Dorries is so keen to parade her ignorance is a mystery – you’d have thought she’d have preferred to leave room for doubt – and Hammond only made half-hearted attempts to defend the deal. The forecasts predicting doom weren’t forecasts. They were modelled scenarios that predicted doom. That sort of thing.Like the rest of the government, Hammond seems more concerned with considering his own future rather than the country’s after the vote is lost next Tuesday.John McDonnell gave a measured and reasoned deconstruction of why the government’s deal was a total mess. He rather glossed over the fact that the Labour leadership had yet to come up with their own plan that didn’t presuppose the EU would give us all the benefits of being in the customs union and single market with none of the obligations.Even so, the shadow chancellor’s contribution was rather more helpful than much of what followed. The nadir was David Davis, who knows even less about the economy than he does about anything else. His main thrust was that he had been absolutely right to do nothing as Brexit secretary because EU negotiations always got done in the last 10 seconds, and that Canada +++ was called Canada +++ because it delivered Canada – – – . Truly we are reaching the end of days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fc8d6f440fdeaaaea5ca96e081baa9826eb5fb7/24_119_2676_1606/master/2676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24c59c28050fbd18595a52b05eb90994","title":"theresa may rejects cabinet pleas postpone brexit vote","story":"PM instead offers a concession in the form of ‘parliamentary lock’ on Irish backstopTheresa May has rejected a plea from some in her cabinet to postpone the vote on the withdrawal bill but has offered concessions to parliament on the contentious issue of the backstop arrangement for avoiding an Irish border.Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether she was prepared to delay a vote she is expected to lose, May said: “No. What I am doing is leading up to a vote on Tuesday. Yes I am meeting colleagues, I’m listening to colleagues’ concerns. Not about delaying it, I’m listening to colleagues’ concerns around the backstop.”May signalled that she was determined to plough on with a vote and suggested a “parliamentary lock” on the Irish backstop could persuade more MPs to back it.She said: “I am talking to colleagues about how we can look at parliament having a role in going into that and coming out of that.”This soft Brexit compromise has been championed by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles as a plan B for leaving the European Union if Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is defeated in the Commons.It is based on Norway’s relationship with the EU, which is outside the bloc and the customs union but inside the single market. Under the plan the UK would have to join Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland in the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which would then allow it to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).The ‘plus’ in this option refers to a temporary customs union with the EU, which would need to be negotiated to avoid a hard border ion the island of Ireland. The temporary arrangement would remain in place until the EU and UK agreed a specific trade deal.The option has the advantage of being as close to the EU as possible without full membership, and it would do away with the need for a problematic backstop for Northern Ireland. Like Norway, the UK would be outside the common fisheries and agriculture policies, and would not be subject to the European court of justice.But it crosses a key red line for Brexiters by continuing freedom of movement, one of the preconditions of single market membership. It would also limit the UK ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence inside the bloc.She insisted a backstop arrangement to avoid a hard border in Ireland was inevitable in any deal, including “Norway” and “Canada” options being proposed by some as alternatives to her plan.She confirmed she was in discussions with MPs opposed to the deal about giving parliament a say in whether the UK entered backstop arrangements or extended the transition period.May said: “If we get to that point there will be a choice between going into the backstop and extending the transition period.”She added: “There are pros and cons to both sides of that. People have a concern at the backstop that we could be in it indefinitely. But in the backstop we have no financial obligations, we have no free movement, and we have very light level playing field rules with the EU. In the implementation period we still have to negotiate the terms, but there will be concerns that there would be more money to be paid, for example.“The obvious, in terms of the role of the UK, is for it to be parliament that makes these decisions.”Asked if she had a plan B if her deal was voted down on Tuesday, May said: “That question is not for me, that question is for those who want to oppose this deal. The options are there: there’s a deal, no deal, or no Brexit.”She added: “It is clear that there are those in the House of Commons who want to frustrate Brexit and overturn the vote of the British people, and that’s not right.“The risk is that we end up with no Brexit at all. I’m clear that should not happen. We have a good deal for leaving the European Union.”May repeated her opposition to a “people’s vote” on her deal. “I don’t think there should be another referendum. We gave people the choice in the referendum as to whether to leave the European Union or not and they gave us a very clear message.”She said those backing a second referendum wanted the public to give a different message. “There are many people who are talking about a second referendum – it isn’t anything to do with this deal, it is actually about trying to frustrate Brexit. This is a point in time when everybody should be thinking of the national interest. And the national interest is making sure that we deliver on that vote.”Calling for unity over the deal, she said: “Now is the time for this country to come back together again. Let’s not create more ision by going back for another referendum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34dc2a47b1f9b33249d6f73c7f10007d78f78f1e/0_127_4546_2727/master/4546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e4610ed7c697559aff17e19334cdecf","title":"uk accused of watering down rights of eu and british citizens","story":"Critics say plan fails to protect EU and UK citizens’ rights, as Barnier restates refusal to renegotiate• Follow the latest political developments - live updatesThe British government has been accused of failing to protect the rights of British and EU citizens in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as Michel Barnier reiterated that he would not renegotiate the agreement currently on the table.Amid demands in Westminster for the prime minister to be sent back to Brussels to seek more concessions from the EU, the bloc’s chief negotiator told a conference of regional leaders: “I must say once again today, calmly and clearly, it is the only and best possible agreement.”Barnier said: “Everybody needs to do their bit, everybody needs to take on the responsibility. The British parliament will be voting on this in the next few days. This has serious implications for the future of the country.”He said a no-deal Brexit remained a possibility, and urged regional leaders and business to speed up their preparations for such an outcome.A Home Office plan for EU citizens’ rights in the UK after a no-deal Brexit, published on Thursday, has been criticised for letting down both EU citizens living in the UK and British citizens on the continent.The European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, a former prime minister of Belgium, said the offer was a “watered-down” version of the terms agreed in the withdrawal agreement.He said: “EU and UK citizens cannot be the victims of a no-deal Brexit, nor used as bargaining chips in the Brexit negotiations. In the case of no deal, the European parliament and I have been clear that we want the citizens’ rights deal that has been provisionally agreed to be ringfenced and the EU must honour this. The citizens’ rights deal shouldn’t be watered down as the UK has today proposed.”EU leaders have previously said the manner in which the British government treats their citizens will be reflected in the hurdles that face UK nationals living on the continent.The settled status scheme envisioned in the withdrawal agreement, under which the government would allow those already in the country to stay and enjoy similar rights to those they have today, is still the basis of the UK’s offer in the event of Britain leaving the UK without a deal.But it will only apply to EU nationals who arrive before 29 March 2019, rather than the end of 2020 when the transition period assumed in the withdrawal agreement would come to an end. There would be an earlier deadline for applications, of 31 December 2020 rather than 30 June 2021, and there would be no right of appeal for applicants.People convicted of minor crimes could also be more easily deported. The document states that the EU deportation threshold would continue to apply to crimes committed before exit but the government would apply the UK deportation threshold to crimes committed after 29 March 2019.It would also be harder for non-EU family members to join their loved ones in the UK, as the cut-off will be brought in for 29 March 2022.Nicolas Hatton, a co-founder of the3million, a lobby group for EU nationals in the UK, described the proposal as “shameful”.He said: “By watering down the rights of EU citizens in case of no-deal Brexit, Theresa May is again using EU citizens as bargaining chips, this time with MPs in order to pass her deal through parliament, after using us as bargaining chip with the EU in the Brexit negotiations.”EU leaders have no intention of reopening negotiations with May at next week’s council summit if she loses the Brexit vote next Tuesday, sources have insisted.Foreign ministers from EU member states will gather on Monday to discuss a “holding statement” to be issued on Tuesday night in the event of a defeat for the prime minister.This will not involve any shift in the current position that the alternative to the deal on the table is no deal. “Our plan is there is no plan beyond this,” a source said.Brussels is expected then to announce it will step up its no-deal planning, with one political source saying some countries, including France and Germany, appear to have an appetite for “two or three weeks of chaos” after 29 March to show that the EU will go the final mile to protect the bloc and to force Britain back to the table.At the conference of regional leaders in Brussels, Barnier stressed that the deal being offered could develop in the transition period into something that would suit those who are calling for the government to pivot towards a “Norway-plus” model.Under that relationship, the UK would have membership of the European Economic Area and the European Free Trade Association, offering single market access, and a permanent customs union.The negotiations over the terms of such a relationship would have to be hammered out during the transition period, however, and the backstop for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, which envisions the UK staying in a customs union and Northern Ireland alone staying in the single market, would remain if a satisfactory wider deal is not negotiated.

The “chief”, as the Tories call him, was someone credited with considerable, and faintly sinister, powers of persuasion. In the US version, the main character in House of Cards was the president. In the UK original, it was Francis Urquhart, the PM’s fictional vote fixer.Julian Smith, the current chief whip, may have just eliminated that mystique in a trice. He has allowed ITV to do some behind-the-scenes filming about his efforts to win next week’s vote, and it includes this footage of him trying to win over the hardline Brexiter Philip Davies in his office. There is no sign of thumbscrews, real or metaphorical. Instead Davies seems to be completely in charge of the conversation, and Smith is left almost tongue-tied. Perhaps he can be persuasive on other occasions, but he doesn’t look like it here. Urquhart would be appalled.A “not” got left out of an earlier post, which I have now corrected. The Tory MP Johnny Mercer told MPs he would not back the Brexit deal. (See 5.15pm.)And here are some highlights from the Lords Brexit debate.Lord Trimble, the former Ulster Unionist leader and an architect of the Good Friday agreement who is now a Conservative peer, said Theresa May’s deal had “perverse” implications for Northern Ireland and had to go. He said:It’s not the desire to leave the EU that’s causing the damage, it’s what the EU is doing by way of reprisal ...If we don’t kill the backstop and this agreement now, it’s going to haunt us for years, decades, maybe even for generations as well.Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, the former cabinet secretary, signalled his support for a second referendum. He said:I do not think that it is undemocratic to believe that the British people are entitled to be given the opportunity of changing their minds if they wish to do so in the light of all that has happened and all that has become known since June 2016. I also suspect that most of the British public are bored stone cold with Brexit and would like to see it go away altogether.Here are some highlights from the Commons Brexit debate this afternoon.The Conservative MP Johnny Mercer said he would not back Theresa May’s deal. He said:I say to the prime minister ‘we must try again’, I don’t want no deal, and I’m afraid I believe that a second referendum would open up isions in this country that frankly me and a lot of others in this country are sick of.This is a seminal moment, and we must be extremely careful to get this right.But Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chairman of the foreign affairs committee, said he would reluctantly back the deal. He said he could not support a second referendum or a no-deal Brexit. He went on:I’m left really with only one choice. Now I don’t say this with any joy but it is not our role to shirk responsibility, it’s not our role to avoid decisions but it’s our role to take them. When I have excluded the impossible I’m left with only one and that, I have to say, with a very heavy heart.There was a flurry of excitement in the office a moment ago when Sky News went live to Downing Street, where the PM was about to appear. But there no resignation statement she was just turning on the Christmas tree lights.Still, it’s got the Twitter commentariat going ...Here is the Commons online Hansard for today’s debate. The speeches go up about three hours after they have been delivered, and currently it is up to Stewart Hosie.Sky’s Beth Rigby has more on Theresa May’s meeting with cabinet ministers early.Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, has told BBC’s Newsnight that, unless Theresa May can provide more clarity on how the UK can leave the backstop, the Brexit vote should be postponed.A few minutes ago in the Commons Sir Christopher Chope, a Tory Brexiter, confirmed that he would vote against Theresa May’s deal. Ironically his speech came only a few hours after YouGov released some new polling suggesting that Chope’s constituency, Christchurch, is one of only two in the Great Britain where voters favour May’s deal over no deal, or staying in the EU.There have been a lot of Brexit opinion polls, but this one is probably more interesting than most because a) it has a huge sample size (more than 20,000 Britons were polled) and b) it used MRP (multi-level regression and poststratification), a technique that involves using large amounts of demographic data to predict how voters will behave in particular constituencies. YouGov used MRP before the 2017 general election to predict a hung parliament when conventional polling had the Tories on course for a big victory.But, using the Condorcet method (a system that ranks multiple options by testing them all out against each other one-to-one), you get a very different result. This system tends to favour the least unacceptable option, and May’s deal wins in most constituencies.The survey also finds that, in a straight contest between no deal and May’s deal, May’s deal would win comfortable. But remain versus no deal, and remain versus May’s deal, are both fairly evenly matched.Michael Gove, Amber Rudd, Andrea Leadsom and Liam Fox left Number 10 after their meeting with the PM (see 2.18pm) without answering reporters’ questions about the vote next week, the Press Association reports.

It will feature “four high profile politicians” (as yet unnamed) “reflecting the main isions in the House of Commons on this issue, Theresa May’s Deal, a softer Brexit, a harder Brexit and People’s VoteRemain”.In the Commons debate Antoinette Sandbach, a Conservative, has said that she will vote for Theresa May’s Brexit deal. A pro-European, she was one of the 12 Tories who defied the party whip on the “meaningful vote” issue in December last year, triggering May’s first Commons defeat on Brexit. But she said he would back the deal because it honoured the referendum result. “It may not be perfect, but it is a good deal,” she said.Tony Blair has been speaking at a press gallery lunch. As prime minister, he was notorious for being lukewarm about parliament as an institution. He said as much in his final PMQs. But, in his speech to journalists, he said that parliament was now operating “like a shadow government” over Brexit, and that he was “heartily thankful”.For the first time in my political memory, parliament is operating like a shadow government. It has taken effective charge of the process surrounding Brexit through the Grieve amendment, ensuring that all options can be voted upon. It has asserted itself with a vigour and clarity of purpose frankly missing from the actual government. It is articulating the different outcomes with a blatant disregard for the government mantra that it is this deal or no deal.I am heartily thankful that parliament is doing so. There is as much leadership on the back benches as on the front. At a moment of supreme importance for the nation, with so much at stake and such bitter isions in the population, they’re doing what I always hoped they would do: behave like leaders, recognising that at this time, party whips can’t matter more than genuine appreciation of where the national interest lies. He also included a self-deprecatory “third way” joke.As I have discovered every time I address groups of people on Brexit, on one thing the nation is united: do Brexit or don’t but no half in and half out. This is a sentiment which unites many leavers and remainers. It is a belief that Britain should determine its path to the future with confidence one way or another, not remain lost in nervous indecision. There is no acceptable third way.Mark Drakeford has been elected as the new Welsh Labour leader, replacing Carwyn Jones, ITV’s Adrian Masters reports.The Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd has resigned the party whip because he is backing Theresa May’s Brexit deal, the party has announced.We respect what we know was a difficult decision for Stephen ahead of next week’s vote and are sorry to see him go.

The sport governing body has committed £10m over the next few years to training up 17,000 secondary school teachers to be more aware of how to make physical activity inclusive.Hollingsworth said there was no one single influence on children’s activity. “Schools are hugely important, government policy within that is hugely important, but so is what is happening outside of school and weekends,” he said. He called for a collective effort to increase participation in physical activity among less affluent children. “If we’re going to move the dial, and we need to, then everyone will need to work together in a collective will to create a better environment for young people.”The survey involved more than 130,000 children aged between five and 16 in England during the 2017-18 academic year.Jane Nickerson, the chief executive of Swim England, pointed out that swimming and water safety was a national curriculum requirement. “The fact there is still a difference between pupils from higher affluence and lower-affluence families is very concerning. Primary school swimming lessons are the one opportunity to ensure all young people have the chance to learn these skills, which is why we must all work together to support schools to deliver them,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e909d8da276dcaa25baca97b134d6d63e8664e75/0_36_6025_3615/master/6025.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d04b42c53a680540b4376e4d4a104bc","title":"young british black men change their names to increase chances of being hired","story":"A Hackney youth project aims to help overqualified, underemployed young people find their placeIn youth centres in cities across the UK, young people are going into the studio and remixing music. But at the Moving on Up project at Hackney Council for Voluntary Service (HCVS), young men searching for a job are remixing their names.Oluwatosin Adegoke, 23, who graduated this year from Bristol University, was an early adopter of this strategy. He’s been called Peter, the last of his four middle names, since he was a child.“I think my African parents want it to be easier for me in school,” he says. “But in the past two to three years I’ve had to start thinking about it a bit more. One, it’s instinct and two, whenever I go by Oluwatosin I have to spell it, and sometimes I get referred to as Oliver – even after I spell it out.”At Moving on Up, which the  visited as part of its Bias in Britain series, they aim to do something about that. “The difference is getting a foot in the door,” says Deji Adeoshun, a youth worker at HCVS, who advises Adegoke and the other young graduates who take part. “I’ve had some guys who have had to change their surname because that was an issue,” he says, describing one in particular who was applying for an IT job.“Same job: applied with his actual surname and didn’t get a call back, applied with a ‘Christian’ name and got an interview.”“It’s white at the top, black at the bottom, and everybody else in between.”Such prejudices have clear economic consequences. The poverty rate for ethnic minorities is double that of white groups, according to research last year by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which also noted that black and brown workers were concentrated in low-paid sectors. And that’s despite generally higher standards of academic attainment than most white groups.And it is young black men who suffer the brunt of the exclusion – in particular thanks to specific stereotypes around aggression and fecklessness. “Aggression and violence is the strongest stereotype that research has shown is associated with black men,” Kandola says.Connor Robinson, from south Croydon, is taller and bigger than your average 18-year-old. Robinson, who is mixed race, has been working with Talent Match Croydon, a local project set up to help disadvantaged young people into work.“Being brown or being black has been a big affect on my life,” says Robinson. “I think white people are very stereotyping towards me because I’m brown, because they think I’m a rudeboy or a gangster. White people are very quick to judge black and brown people.”While many black and brown people learn to ignore – or become inured to – such casual racism, for Connor, who is autistic, the experiences continue to trouble him. Racism means Connor is socially isolated from a community which he strongly identifies with through his white mother.Most confrontational racism went out with the Equalities Acts, hate crimes legislation and black and white TV. As Adeoshun, the youth worker, points out, these days, and particularly in the workplace: “Racism is not overt, it’s subtle.”While discrimination comes top of a list of barriers that face young black jobseekers, it is commonly expressed through other, related hurdles. One is a lack of self-confidence in an alien environment entirely the preserve of whites.Another problem is a lack of role models and social networks to help them into industries. One of the young men at Hackney CVS that day was Lamide Olusegun, 23, who this year received a highjer education diploma in animation from the University of the Creative Arts. Initially, he had hoped for work in a production company. It was not that the doors were shut to him more that he could not find any doors at all.“I felt like it’s who you know, it’s not really what’s on your portfolios. Especially in this art field. A lot of jobs are gotten in the bars and it’s just connections,” he says. As a black animator, he has no one to look up to. “I’ve not seen personally any other black animators. Even at uni on my course, I don’t think there was that many black people, maybe just a handful – or even Asians as well, just ethnic people.”Such barriers mean that by the time young black men find their way into work, they have been forced to severely moderate their ambitions. As a result they – and particularly the subgroup of black African workers – are more likely to be overqualified for their roles. Adeoshun, a law graduate, is a prime example. He passed his bar exams only to find he was unable to secure a pupillage at a chambers.And for those who stay stuck on the scrapheap, the lure of the black economy is strong. One young man in Croydon speaks of how, in an effort to raise a couple of hundred pounds, he pulled a scam and was convicted of fraud. Now he is blocked from any job in a bank, further limiting his prospects.What are the solutions? Many companies – including the  – have begun rolling out unconscious bias training for senior managers, in an effort to make them aware of any unexamined prejudices that may be putting them off hiring people from ethnic minority groups.But in a key report on race in the workplace commissioned by the government and published in February last year, the Conservative peer Ruby McGregor-Smith said this unconscious bias was often anything but. “We need to stop hiding behind the mantle of ‘unconscious bias’,” she declared.Lady McGregor-Smith said: “I have to question how much of this bias is truly ‘unconscious’ and by terming it ‘unconscious’, how much it allows us to hide behind it. Conscious or unconscious, the end result of bias is racial discrimination, which we cannot and should not accept.”Kandola, the business psychologist, warns that such a stance risks undermining attempts to eliminate what is a most insidious form of racism. “Not all biases are conscious,” he says. “There are some things that are very blatant that occur in the workplace and they are clearly not unconscious. But there are other things which are far more subtle that happen and people may not be aware they are doing it.He recommends seeing racial bias as a performance issue at work, feeding back to managers about their biases and telling them how to change them – and disciplining those who fail to respond.But young black men are not sitting back and waiting for procedures to be put in place and for attitudes to change. Olusegun is among them. Instead of trying to find work with an established production company, he has taken his future into his own hands by starting his own business, merchandising his cartoon characters for sale online and in the market.“I’ve seen the light in self-employment, it’s helped me build some resilience as well,” he says. “I’ve learned so much of how to run a business, how to brand yourself, how to market yourself. These are things that I had a little idea about, but I’d never had a chance to practice it.“And I’m seeing results as well, so it’s not looking bleak for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33a613dab69e801a084f69b053a258ffb27bd3a8/0_101_2504_1502/master/2504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b38bfcb14faba035b07db1084fcc6e5a","title":"sports advertising ban horse racing","story":"It is not often that bookmakers give in to pressure from anti-gambling groups without being forced to, so Thursday’s news that the biggest names in online betting will soon introduce a whistle-to-whistle ban on television advertising around sporting events is a collector’s item. Ray Winstone’s loss, many will feel, is the armchair fan’s gain.The market leaders in online gambling, including Bet365, SkyBet and Paddy Power Betfair, are all signed up to the voluntary ban, from which TV coverage of horse racing will be exempt. So, too, are the firms with big retail estates, such as Ladbrokes, Coral and William Hill, who may – perhaps – have learned a lesson from their long, bitter and ultimately futile campaign to resist pressure for a cut in stakes on fixed‑odds betting terminals.The agreement announced on Thursday in effect implements a proposal that was expected to feature in the next Labour manifesto, and does so, in all likelihood, at least three and a half years in advance of any legal requirement to do so.So, has the UK’s gambling industry suddenly decided that its opponents were right all along? Of course not. Their decision will have been taken after careful consideration of its long-term effect on profitability, versus the possible impact of even stricter regulation further down the line. The clear concern seems to be that, if they do not do something themselves, the alternative could be much, much worse.It is a calculated move, not a climbdown. And when it comes to football, which dominates the online market, it is also far from complete as it does not cover shirt sponsorships, for instance.But again this could have knock-on benefits for some British firms at least, since the overwhelming majority of betting‑related shirt sponsors are Asian firms with no significant customer base in the UK. If there are no gambling ads in the breaks, the Premier League could feel that the time is right to ban shirt sponsorships for gambling businesses, too – which would be no bad thing for high-profile UK-based bookies that operate in the Asian market.It is also significant that the bookies’ self-imposed ban covers the entirety of any sporting event bar racing that starts before 9pm, so there will be no blitz of ads post‑watershed. This means racing will soon find itself in the happy position of being the only sport around which the biggest names in betting are able to advertise, which could prove a significant boost for the only sport that has been intertwined with betting from its earliest days.The law of supply and demand suggests the value of the advertising opportunities around the sport can go only one way. As a result the value of racing’s media rights, for instance, should also increase and the terrestrial rights in particular could be a very interesting proposition for a number of bidders when ITV’s contract expires at the end of 2020.As things stand, and assuming the bookies’ agreement holds, racing could offer not just the best but the only significant space on mainstream TV to advertise betting brands around sport.The bookies’ greatest fear, of course, is racing’s nightmare, too. What if a future government decides that even stricter regulation is required and introduces a blanket ban on gambling advertising? Nothing seems impossible in politics these days but Labour’s proposal included an exemption for racing and the industry is such an important employer that it is difficult to see either major party going that far.The days when racing accounted for the overwhelming majority of the bookies’ turnover are long gone but the sport remains, in many respects, the best and most compelling of all betting mediums.Any move that increases racing’s significance for the bookies can work only in the sport’s favour, because, like it or not – and there are still plenty who try to pretend otherwise – betting will always be vital for racing’s popularity and prosperity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e23b77b24113cd482046d96ce46ef53fe76e1bb9/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49792aefa5d31c7a48a70a0628554bbf","title":"choose your favourite stage show of 2018","story":"Which plays left you speechless?

In March this year that logging became public when users discovered details of their communications as they downloaded their personal data using new tools created to comply with the EU’s general data protection regulation (GDPR).Facebook has always maintained that it only collected data from users who opted in, but in a tranche of internal emails obtained as part of a lawsuit against the company and released by the digital, culture, media and sport committee, employees discuss how to minimise the amount of consent they would need to ask for to begin the collection.“The growth team is planning on shipping a permissions update on Android at the end of this month,” Michael LeBeau, then a project manager at the company, wrote in an email sent in February 2015. The growth team is in charge of encouraging more people to join Facebook and encouraging those who have already signed up to use it more.“They are going to include the ‘read call log’ permission … for a feature that lets you continuously upload your SMS and call log history to Facebook,” he continued. “This is a pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it … We think the risk of PR fallout here is high.“Screenshot of the scary Android permissions screen becomes a meme, propagates around the web, it gets press attention and enterprising journalists dig into what exactly the new update is requesting, then write stories about ‘Facebook uses new Android update to pry into your private life in ever more terrifying ways – reading your call logs, tracking you in businesses with beacons, etc’.”Yul Kwon, one of the company’s “privacy sherpas”, whose job was to make sure Facebook did not “set off any privacy dynamite”, replied to LeBeau with an alternative plan: “The growth team is now exploring a path where we only request read call log permission, and hold off on requesting on any other permissions for now.“Based on their initial testing, it seems that this would allow us to upgrade users without subjecting them to an Android permissions dialog at all. It would still be a breaking change, so users would have to click to upgrade, but no permissions dialog screen.”Because of the changes, when Facebook did begin asking for permission inside the app, it was able to write its own request rather than using the standard language of Google’s Android operating system.In its request, it did not mention call logs at all, instead asking users if they wanted to “send and receive SMS inside messenger”, on a request box without a “no” button. Instead, the two options were a blue button labelled “OK” or a greyed-out link to “Settings”.Since many users had already given Facebook the technical capability to do so when they installed the app, if they hit OK it was the last they knew about the call and text logging – until they rediscovered the logs in March of this year.In a statement released on Wednesday, Facebook said: “The feature is opt-in for users and we ask for people’s permission before enabling. We always consider the best way to ask for a person’s permission, whether that’s through a permission dialog set by a mobile operating system like Android or iOS, or a permission we design in the Facebook app.“With this feature, we asked for permission inside the Facebook Messenger app, and this was a discussion about how our decision to launch this opt-in feature would interact with the Android operating system’s own permission screens. This was not a discussion about avoiding asking people for permission.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0558417bb563f66715cff99188d792f795bb4891/0_432_2150_1290/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faec75bf020e46f654e8141a539875c8","title":"can i use predictive text pc app windows 10","story":"Richard likes Swype’s predictive text on his tablet and wants a similar app for a Windows 10 PCIs there an intelligent keyboard app for Windows 10? I use Swype on my tablet, and apart from being faster than keyboard typing, I love the power of its intelligent predictive text. My PC doesn’t have a touch screen, but I feel I would still benefit from the predictive text, as I’m not a touch typer. I looked at Grammarly, and a couple of others, but they’re not really what I’m after. RichardPredictive text programs have been around for a long time, and many are still available. The first one I used was Brown Bag Software’s MindReader, which arrived on a 5.25in floppy disk in the early 1980s. I don’t know if Brown Bag came up with the idea, but its approach is typical.MindReader read what you were typing, guessed what the word might be, and popped up a numbered list of choices. You could then insert a whole word by selecting the one you wanted. If you didn’t want any of them, you just carried on typing.Many predictive text programs use the PC’s function keys to make the selection, though I can’t remember if MindReader did this as well.If you were a fast typist – even the two-fingered type – then programs such as MindReader were more annoying than helpful. However, predictive software was tremendously useful to people who needed assistance for other reasons. Penfriend says its predictive software “benefits users who have dyslexia, visual impairment or physical disabilities, including cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, stroke, limb deformities and any condition which impairs the ability to write with a keyboard”.Predictive text programs are also useful in schools, because children can select words that they know but aren’t sure how to spell. Programs such as Quillsoft’s WordQ 5 help by voicing words. It’s usually easier to know if a word sounds right than if it looks right.There are lots of commercial programs aimed at schools. These include Penfriend XP and XL, WordQ, ClaroRead and Crick Software’s Clicker. Much less powerful but free examples for general use include TypingAid, Volkmar Kobelt’s VK TypeHelp and the open-source Presage, which was formerly known as Soothsayer. PhraseExpress isn’t cheap, but you can get a freeware version called Text Expander. TypingAid, which is written using AutoHotkey, works at the system level, so it works with most applications.If you take this route, the best program for your purposes could be SumitSoft’s Typing Assistant. Its features include word prediction, auto-complete, auto-correct and, for abbreviations, auto-expand. It has a Skilled Typist Mode for translators, secretaries, authors, programmers and so on and an Unskilled Typist Mode for people who have problems spelling (including in 50+ foreign languages) or physical disabilities. It costs $129.95 but there’s a 30-day money back guarantee. FastKeys is a cheaper alternative – see below.There’s also Texthelp’s Read\u0026ampWrite, which costs £150 a year and has more than 10 million users, thanks to its corporate and education versions. You’re unlikely to buy Read\u0026ampWrite, but there’s a Google Chrome extension that you can try free for 30 days.When smartphones arrived, predictive text was still a great time-saver. And with the moves from PC keyboards to Blackberry-style phone keyboards to on-screen touch keyboards, we finally got programs such as IBM’s ShapeWriter, Swype, SwiftKey and Google’s Gboard.The bad news is that, as you probably know, Swype has been discontinued. (Nuance bought the company from Cliff Kushler.) The good news is that many people preferred SwiftKey, and that SwiftKey is now being added to Windows 10. (In this case, Microsoft bought the company, despite Microsoft Research coming up with its own Word Flow keyboard.)In Windows 10 (October 2018 Update), go to the Settings cogwheel, select Devices and then Typing. Click on “Suggestions and autocorrections” and turn SwiftKey on for the languages you type in. The initial version should be much enhanced in future updates.It’s not going to be much use to you if you don’t have a touchscreen to work on, but a large proportion of Windows 10 laptops now have touchscreens.This is the age of “big data”, and it’s changing software. In the old days, you needed clever programming to do things like speech recognition and predictive text. Now you can deliver effective results with simple algorithms if you have enough data for pattern matching. Google has frighteningly large amounts of data, and it is using it to good effect.A couple of years ago I stopped using smartphone keyboards almost completely, because the speech recognition on my Android phone made typing a waste of time. And if your PC has a microphone, you can use speech recognition in Google Docs with a Chrome-type browser.Of course, speech recognition has been part of Windows for two decades, and in Windows 10, you can turn it on and off by pressing WinKey-Ctrl-S. There are also good specialised programs such as Nuance’s Dragon Dictate. But programs that run only on a local PC have a hard time competing with ones that use servers with AI and access to petabytes of data.The latest version of Gmail includes predictive text by default. Basically, Gmail’s Smart Compose system tries to complete your sentences and you just hit the tab key to accept its suggestion. It’s intended for writing emails, but you can write whatever you like, then copy and paste your text into a real document.Smart Compose might help smartphone users, but it’s worse than useless if you’re a touch-typist with a proper keyboard. Just thinking about whether to accept Smart Compose’s suggestions is distracting, and it’s usually far quicker to ignore them and just keep typing.To disable the Smart Compose and Smart Reply features in Gmail, click the cogwheel icon and select Settings. Go down the General menus and click the radio buttons to set “Writing suggestions off” and “Smart Reply off”. You can tell all your friends how easy it is to do this.Many programs will offer to complete a word once you have started typing it LibreOffice is a good example. (See my earlier answer on the difference between LibreOffice and OpenOffice.)LibreOffice has an AutoCorrect feature that remembers every eight-letter (or longer) word you type. The next time you type the first three letters of that word, it will offer to complete it. Again, this is annoying and will slow down a fast typist, but some users will find it a boon. It could work if you delete words you don’t want auto-completed and just type three letters plus Enter for long words you use often.In LibreOffice Writer, go to Tools, select AutoCorrect and then AutoCorrect Options. The AutoCorrect dialogue box has a tab for Word Completion. There you can set the minimum word length and change the “Accept with” key from Enter to Tab or, perhaps, the space bar.The common trick in Microsoft Office is to set up AutoCorrect options for long words or phrases that you use often. For example, #tyf could be autocorrected to “Thank you for your letter” while #csi could automatically insert chrono-synclastic infundibulum, or whatever.You could use the same approach system-wide with a program such as AutoHotKey. Better still, you could add a script that someone has already written, such as Uberi’s Autocomplete 1.2. The code is on GitHub so you could even adapt it yourself.As an alternative, FastKeys is a reasonably priced ($19 for three PCs) commercial Windows automation program specifically designed to save you typing.Have you got a question?

Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

In the departures hall, weeping passengers prepare for exile, unsure when they will return.At customs, a sticker on one x-ray machine warns: “Here you don’t speak badly about Chávez!”But even before stepping outside the terminal it is obvious his Bolivarian revolution, like the airport’s immobile escalators, has ground to a halt.On 6 December 1998, Hugo Chávez proclaimed a new dawn of social justice and people power. “Venezuela’s resurrection is under way and nothing and nobody can stop it,” the leftwing populist told a sea of euphoric supporters after his landslide election victory.Two decades on, those dreams are in tatters.To understand Venezuela’s collapse, the  travelled hundreds of miles across the nation Chávez dreamed of transforming, from the spot in downtown Caracas where he gave his first speech as president-elect to his birthplace in the country’s sun-scorched southwestern plains.On the way, we encountered lingering affection for a charismatic populist still celebrated as a champion of the poor, and a determination among Venezuelans from all walks of life to somehow weather the economic cyclone ravaging their country.But above all, there was deprivation, hunger, profound apprehension and seething anger – even among proud chavistas – at a government now incapable of fulfilling its citizens’ most basic needs, and in denial over a humanitarian crisis unprecedented in modern Latin American history.“People do not understand what is happening in Venezuela because it is too hard to believe,” says Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi, a doctor in the city of Barquisimeto, describing the implosion of a health service that was once the envy of the region. “The most oil-rich country absolutely devastated and turned into a war-torn nation – without a war.“I’m not angry. I’m terribly sad. Because there was absolutely no need to get to this point. They just left the country to die … and it is heartbreaking.”Twenty years after Chávez declared Venezuela’s rebirth, its capital is on its knees. Billboards try to persuade citizens that “together everything is possible” but the mood is funereal and dazed.By night, swaths of the city resemble a disaster zone: deserted, carless streets are plunged into darkness by power outages and broken street lights. Famished citizens probe uncollected heaps of rubbish.“The feeling I have is one of a slow-motion catastrophe,” says Ana Teresa Torres, a Caracas-based author. “It’s as if you are watching a building collapse and there is nothing you can do to stop it.”Despite the meltdown, in a traditionally chavista shantytown called San Agustín, there is still devotion to the politician many call “mi comandante”.“He was the man who took the poor out of the catacombs,” says Gilda González, 50, the local coordinator of Misión Ribas, an educational programme Chávez set up in 2003.González, a self-declared revolucionaria who keeps Fidel Castro’s memoirs by her desk, pointed to an horizon of government-built apartment blocks. “Everything you see here today was the comandante’s doing, and our president, Nicolás Maduro, is fighting hard to continue that work,” she said of the man who inherited Chávez’s revolution after he died in 2013.Venezuela’s leaders blame the country’s plight on sanctions and an “economic war” waged by what the foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, recently called the “extremist, supremacist, racist” government of Donald Trump. “It’s not just an economic war​,​ it’s an all-round war – a political war, a media war and a trade war,” Arreaza claimed.González agrees, and warns Bolivarian militias will resist if the US president makes good on insinuations that Maduro could be toppled by foreign force. “We are ready for asymmetric war,” she says.But as Venezuela staggers deeper into ruin, once-ardent believers are losing their faith. Pedro García, a chavista social worker and musician in the same community, claims Chávez’s heirs have led the country into an abyss of political infighting and thievery. As if to confirm his point, the following day Chávez’s former treasurer was sentenced to 10 years in jail in the US for taking more than a billion dollars in bribes.García said he continued to treasure the ideals underpinning Chávez’s Bolivarian struggle – but under Maduro, Venezuela had become like a pressure cooker that had been left on for too long. “This mess will explode any minute.”“See this? This is our country,” says Lilibeth Sandoval, a lawyer and regional representative of the opposition group Vente Venezuela, as she tiptoes through the debris of a derelict textile mill Chávez toured 13 years ago. “Destroyed!”At a nearby petrol station, attendants complain they have not been paid in months by Pdvsa, the state-run oil company that oversees the world’s biggest crude reserves. “And this is still a good job,” says Eduardo Martínez. Tips from drivers mean it is just about possible to survive.But Martínez’s trousers are shredded, his shoes filled with holes, and he has a seeping, untreated abscess on his left wrist. “One day this will all come crashing down, just like the Twin Towers,” he says.A grinning Maduro stares down from a billboard at the turn-off to the rural town of Macapo, alongside the rallying cry: “Vamos Venezuela.”Thousands of locals have already gone.The United Nations estimates 3 million have fled the country since 2015 to escape chronic food and medicine shortages, crumbling healthcare and transport systems and an economy in freefall.No life has been untouched and Guevara, 53, is no exception.In February his wife, Glenda, set off overland for Peru with a group of 15 relatives. She works as a carer-cum-accountant in Lima and sends funds to help her husband who lives off a weekly pension of about 900 bolivares (about $1.8) – an almost impossible task because of rampant hyperinflation that Maduro’s supposedly visionary economic recovery plan has failed to tame.“That’s not even enough to buy a kilo of cheese,” says Guevara.With his wife gone, Guevara has busied himself decorating his home ahead of a lonely Christmas. “This year there will be an emptiness,” he says, tears welling in his eyes.Guevara says he believes political change is on the horizon and Venezuela’s diaspora will soon return to rebuild their homeland. But like all those the  interviewed, he is unable to say how or when.Venezuela’s opposition is fractured and, while localised protests continue, the mass demonstrations of last year have faded, with many participants chosing instead to leave the country.Top chavista officials deny their citizens are going hungry and have called the migration crisis fake news. A visit to the one-room hovel Ivan Henríquez shares with his wife and six children in the city of Barquisimeto gives the lie to those claims. “They are living in a parallel world,” the 35-year-old says of the daily churn of disinformation on state TV.As Venezuela’s crisis has deepened over the past year, Henríquez, like millions of his fellow citizens, has found it increasingly hard to feed his family, let alone himself. “I used to weigh something like 70kg – now I’m 50kg, or less,” he says, showing the contents of their pantry: a half-empty sack of maize and a plastic bag filled with a few sticks of cassava.Outside, in a rubbish-strewn garden, his children – aged from 11 months to 13 – study around a table fashioned from a broken door with breezeblocks as legs.“So many people are dying of hunger in this country … children are dying because of malnutrition,” he says, lowering his voice to avoid his own offspring overhearing that bleak assessment.Henríquez blames his family’s plight on an ideological clash from which his country’s leaders have refused to step back. “Venezuelans are stuck in the middle of a war that isn’t theirs.”The highway to Barinas, the south-western state where Chávez grew up, is dotted with reminders of Venezuela’s decay: families hauling armfuls of firewood or hiking down the hard shoulder because public buses are now as hard to find as food police barricades where forlorn-looking officers shake down passersby for a pittance abandoned factories, grain silos and car showrooms being reclaimed by the undergrowth graffiti demanding the removal of the man most blame for the calamity – “¡Fuera Maduro!” – and patches of scorched asphalt where tires have been burned by protesters.Fading Socialist party murals insist everything is in order: “Chávez vive y la patria sigue!” (“Chávez lives and the homeland goes on!”)But these days few are fooled by such claims. “Our lives are becoming impossible,” says Ezequiel Mota, a 73-year-old farmer, queuing outside a military controlled petrol station in the state capital. He expects to be there for at least 10 hours.Across town the  saw three petrol queues of more than 140 cars each. In the countryside, a driver in an even longer line of vehicles says he has been waiting two days: “Sometimes it’s four.”“Ninety per cent of citizens are against the government because they are leading us into the most absolute state of misery and poverty in the world,” Mota says. “That’s the truth.”Rosa Rivas has a poster from Chávez’s final election campaign in pride of place on the wall of her sitting room. “I have so much faith in the president,” she says. “I fear nothing when he’s close by.”Rivas, at 85 still chavista to the bone, recalls wanting to die when she heard of her protector’s passing. “I love him,” she whispers.But in the town where Chávez was born, such dedication appears to be fading.Palencia, 46, says shortages of food, medicine, gas, petrol and drinking water mean many residents are turning against Chávez’s “malignant legacy”.A minstrel as well as a militant, Palencia reaches for a Venezuelan four-string guitar to perform his musical rebuke to chavismo. “From here in Barinas, I want to ask my Venezuela for forgiveness,” he sings. “Because we know it was here that the disaster began, it was here that the comandante who destroyed my nation was born.”Palencia’s mother, Vidalina, grew up with “Huguito” and cheered his rise to power in 1998. “I felt proud that a boy I knew was going to be president of the republic and suddenly everything was going to change,” the 68-year-old says.But Vidalina’s feelings shifted for good after she was diagnosed with cancer and – like millions of ailing Venezuelans – was unable to find the drugs she needed. “My only desire is for this mistaken revolution to end.”In 2016 Vladimir Putin donated a granite statue of Chávez to Sabaneta and it was placed in one of its main squares to celebrate the legacy of “the illustrious son of the Venezuelan people”.Today it is chipped and charred having been set upon by anti-government protesters. They failed to tear it down, but have vowed to return.Nearby, Chávez’s childhood home is open to the public as a tribute to Venezuela’s “21st-century liberator” and his Bolivarian crusade. But it, too, has fallen on hard times. One room lacks a lightbulb in another, a display case holding a pair of maracas has fallen off the wall and is propped up on two plastic chairs.Outside on the veranda, beside a mango tree the comandante once scaled, there is a guestbook containing homages that sometimes hint at Venezuela’s decline. “Very good,” one pilgrim wrote in April. “But lacking in electricity.”The museum caretaker, charged with receiving tourists since its two unpaid guides quit earlier this year, invites his latest visitors to add their names to the revolutionary register.There was just one problem. “We don’t have a pencil right now.”Additional reporting Patricia Torres and Clavel Rangel• This article was amended on 6 December 2018 to replace the word “exasperated” in the heading on a graph, where “exacerbated” was meant."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Turn of phrase was in context of a proposed change to administrative boundary, court toldEvidence of the location of Dwyer\u0026rsquos work phone helped tied him to other phones in the caseThe event invites people to fill wrapped shoeboxes to be given to homeless peopleDwyer trying to overturn conviction for murder of childcare worker Elaine O\u0026rsquoHaraDisadvantaged students fare better socially and academically with on-campus supportsForum hears that Russia is trying to break up EU and spending millions on disinformationJean Philippe Grenet (56) claims he was not afforded fair procedures before dismissalGusts of between 110 to 130kmh are expected, with a risk of coastal damageLabour\u0026rsquos Sadiq Khan on Dublin visit tells Theresa May to halt Brexit if deal is rejectedMan sought redress over abuse by named Brothers in 1960sKieran Byrne from Cadamstown, Kinnity, Co Offaly, died in Beaumont Hospital in DublinMick Barry says doctors nervous about seeking import licence for schedule 1 drugOur Lady\u0026rsquos Hospice viewed video for \u0026lsquoIsis\u0026rsquo graffiti inquiry but discovered staff taking unauthorised breaksMark Hennessy (40) shot by a garda at Cherrywood Business Park, Co DublinCharlie Flanagan says legal framework \u0026lsquoneeds to be modernised\u0026rsquoHarris says claims Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy Bill is being rushed are \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquoEmergency services responded to fire in the early hours of Thursday morning"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe UK could “sleep-walk off the cliff edge” with no deal on exiting the EU if Theresa May’s plan is rejected next week and she does not call off Brexit, London mayor Sadiq Khan has warned.On a visit to Dublin, the Labour politician said he expected the UK parliament to reject Mrs May’s proposed Brexit agreement in next Tuesday’s vote and for his party then to call for a general election.“We will have to wait and see if there are enough MPs to vote for that. If that doesn’t happen, the next best thing is a people’s vote,” Mr Khan said after addressing a business audience in Dublin.The London mayor said a no-deal exit increased the chance of a hard Irish border.A prominent pro-EU campaigner during the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, Mr Khan wants to see a second public vote on the UK’s decision to leave the EU giving the people “a say in whether we accept the deal or no deal with the option of staying”.“Now we know that the promises made in 2016 were a lie. Now we know what the terms of exiting the EU, either a bad deal or no deal whatsoever,” he told The .“The British public will vote to stay and the reality is that in 2016 so many of those who campaigned to leave told lies and the British public were sold a false prospective.”Mr Khan said he was “not a fan of ‘best of three or five’ referendums” – nor did he believe in “never-endums” – but he felt that the British public would take a different view on leaving the EU now and that politicians “shouldn’t be scared about the British public taking back control”.“Now we know there isn’t the land of milk and honey outside the EU but actually the terms of exit aren’t great. The British public can now vote with foresight and knowledge on whether we are going to accept exit on the terms we have been given or the option of staying in the EU,” he said.During his day-long visit to Dublin, Mr Khan met President Michael D Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Government Buildings.The British politician expressed concerns about the impact of a potential no-deal Brexit not just on London or the wider UK economy but on the European Union too.“My worry is that we could sleep-walk off the cliff edge and leave the EU with no deal whatsoever. It is bad for London, bad for the UK and bad for Europe. That is why Theresa May should stop governing in the party interest and think about the country,” he said in an interview.He declined to say whether Mrs May should resign if her deal falls at the parliamentary hurdle.In a speech to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, Mr Khan called on Mrs May to halt the country’s exit from the EU if she fails to get her proposed orce deal from the EU passed by parliament.The prime minister should, he said, withdraw the article 50 application taking the UK out of the EU on March 29th, 2019 if parliament rejects her deal, “which is looking extremely likely.”“The very notion of a no-deal Brexit must be taken off the table by the British government. It is just too dangerous to leave as a possibility,” he said.Withdrawing article 50 in the event of parliament rejecting her deal was “the single best way to guarantee that we avoid falling off a cliff-edge”, he said.“It would stop the clock that is ticking towards a no deal Brexit and it would provide the breaking space to decide how we resolve this mess,” he said.A no-deal exit was the “worst possible outcome”, he said, and this remained “a grave concern given the political uncertainty at Westminster”.“This would not only be devastating for London’s economy but could actually hurt businesses across Europe, including here in Dublin, and increase the chance of a hard border on the island of Ireland, ” he said.Mr Khan poked fun at Mrs May in his speech saying that she has as much chance of passing through parliament “as her securing the lead role in the next production of Riverdance”.“And those of you who have seen those dance moves know exactly what I mean,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3722312.1544091700!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit may says mps may be given choice between backstop and extending transition","story":"UK prime minister Theresa May vows to honour the Belfast Agreement as MPs debate the proposed Brexit agreement.

File photograph: Julien WarnandEPABritish prime minister Theresa May has signalled that MPs could be given the power to decide whether the UK goes into a controversial Brexit backstop arrangement that is designed to ensure an open Border in Ireland.Mrs May indicated the British parliament would choose between triggering the backstop or extending a transition period after the UK formally quits the EU.The move is likely to be seen as a bid to bolster flagging support ahead of a crunch House of Commons vote on her EU withdrawal agreement next Tuesday — a showdown she made clear she would not postpone.Mrs May told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There will be a choice between, if we get to that point, a choice between going into the backstop and extending the transition period.“Now, there are pros and cons of both sides of that.“People have a concern of the backstop, that we could be in it indefinitely.“But, in the backstop we have no financial obligations, we have no free movement, we have very light level playing field rules with the EU.“In the implementation period, we still have to negotiate the terms, but there will be concerns about the fact that they would require, I’m sure they would require, some more money to be paid, for example.“So there would be arguments on different sides.”Asked if she would be happy for Parliament to adjudicate on whether to go into the backstop or extend implementation, the PM said: “I think people are concerned about the role of the UK in making these decisions.“And, the obvious, in terms of the UK, is for it to be Parliament that makes these decisions.”The backstop, intended to prevent the return of a hard Border in Northern Ireland, is highly controversial as Brexiteer MPs claim it traps the UK into obeying rules set by Brussels without a say over them.The British government insists it aims to conclude a comprehensive trade deal with the EU before a backstop arrangement would be needed.Mrs May said that any deal with the EU, such as a Canada-style free trade agreement favoured by some Brexiteers, would also require a backstop arrangement.Mrs May’s comments came as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) insisted it will withdraw support for her Government if the Prime Minister presses ahead with the Brexit deal with the EU.Asked if the DUP was prepared to precipitate a general election, the party’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “If it comes to the point where the Government makes, shows, a determination to implement the Withdrawal Agreement with its damaging terms at present, or some future version of it, which is still equally damaging, we will not be supporting the Government.”Meanwhile a European Court of Justice ruling on the reversibility of Article 50 will take place the day before MPs vote on Mrs May’s Brexit deal, the court has announced. It said in a tweet: “#Brexit: the ruling on the reversibility of #Article50 TEU (case C-62118 Wightman) will be delivered on 10th December at 9 CET.” - PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Many “yellow vest” groups are calling for an Act IV” of unrest on Facebook and across social media.But two of the movements’ most prominent figures came in for criticism in French media yesterday.It transpired that one called Jean-François Bernaba had been receiving  €2,600 per month as a civil servant for ten years without actually turning up for a job. Another, Maxime Nicolle, one of eight people who now claim to be spokespersons for the movement, was outed as a prolific sharer of conspiracy theories. Notably, Mr Nicolle, who is known as Fly Rider, has been urging protesters to rush to Paris before December 10. He wrongly claimed that on that day Mr Macron intended to “sell France to the UN” and allow in millions of migrants. Luxembourg to become world’s first nation to make all public transport freeOxford and Cambridge should admit students who have not done A-levels,  Education Secretary saysBrexit latest news: Theresa May urged to delay meaningful vote as she  explores options to give MPs a say on Irish backstopDavid Mundell warns wavering Tory MPs no deal Brexit poses greater threat to Union than backstopWhen does Parliament vote on the Brexit deal?

Residents have now been asking about why they weren\u0027t consulted.”The lavatory, which did not require planning permission, has been installed to serve drivers on the half-hourly R2 route via Orpington in the London Borough of Bromley, TfL said.But, Mr Bennington, said: “This has never been raised as a difficulty.It\u0027s a totally unsuitable location, it\u0027s entirely residential and the other end of the bus route is Orpington Town Centre so there are toilets there and premises.”It\u0027s been called locally, The Turdis, you can understand the reasons for that. I\u0027m hoping they will get rid of it and adjust the timing on the bus route so drivers can stop in Orpington.”Local resident Stephanie Willis added: “It’s the most ugly thing I have ever seen - it is a monstrosity.“If this is a Dr Who-themed Christmas present from TfL then they should take it back.This is a quiet residential area where people have lived peacefully for years. Now we have a big ugly blot on the community, I am absolutely furious.Just behind my house are lovely green hills, it is a beautiful area ruined by this big metal toilet.Nick Fairholme, director of project and programme delivery at TfL, said that the lavatory had been “installed in agreement” with the local council and that the body was “sorry not all residents were aware”.He said: “Unfortunately our courtesy letters did not reach all residents. We are investigating how this happened to ensure it does not happen again.”However, a Bromley Council spokesman said, “It is not true for TfL to assert that the Council “agreed” to this.  For absolute clarity, the Council has not agreed to the installation of the toilet facilities. We were informed of TfL’s intention to install the structures and that they were exercising their permitted development rights. It is true that we did not raise a highway safety concern, because there aren’t any, but this does not constitute ‘agreement’.”Councillor William Huntington-Thresher, executive councillor for environment, said, “It does not appear that local people have been consulted and we are contacting TfL urgently to ask exactly who was consulted – whilst neither Bromley’s permission nor planning permission may be required, this does not mean that the views of local people can be disregarded, with the potential for these toilets to attract anti-social behaviour, with vandalism already an issue.We are making TfL aware of the views of our residents to these installations at these unwelcome locations. We will continue to engage with TfL to provide them with the benefit of local knowledge and alert them to local issues. We remain hopeful that TfL will listen more often than at present.”Polly Straight, who lives on the road,  said: “These government bodies couldn’t give a s*** about the people that pay their wages.“The toilet just has to go outside someone’s house and it’s convenient the letters of this imposition didn’t arrive.”Transport for London (TfL)Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May urged to delay meaningful vote as she  explores options to give MPs a say on Irish backstopLuxembourg to become world’s first nation to make all public transport freeOxford and Cambridge should admit students who have not done A-levels,  Education Secretary saysFrance to deploy \u0026#39exceptional\u0026#39 number of security forces as government braces for violent yellow vest protestDavid Mundell warns wavering Tory MPs no deal Brexit poses greater threat to Union than backstopWhen does Parliament vote on the Brexit deal?

One is called Eloise, the other is ViaVan. You might think giving birth could get in the way of doing the top job. Not so for Oppetit. Almost the opposite in fact. The embryonic ViaVan was taking shape at around the same time as her second daughter. And they called her four days after the birth to ask if she would consider being “head of London”. Now Eloise is four months old and her Mum is running the newest car-sharing “corner to corner” setup in the capital. “I still get back to put her to bed at night though,” she says, in a café down the street from the ViaVan base near Liverpool Street. Oppetit has a Lauren Bacall-style huskiness but with an Australian accent. She was born in Melbourne 32 years ago and studied law and commerce at the University of Melbourne. Her first job was on the law side, working on sex-offender cases. “I wasn’t sure I could have defended some of these guys with the appropriate level of neutrality,” she says. Not when there was a high risk of reoffending. “I realised I was more into the commerce side.” Houzz CEO Adi Tatarko on running a $4bn internet startup A View from the Top: Green Man Gaming CEO Paul Sulyok A View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techA View from the top: Will Ramsay, CEO of the Affordable Art FairMelbourne is a lovely city and most of her friends and peers were staying put, settling down,\u0026nbspgetting married\u0026nbspand moving into houses a couple of blocks away from where their parents lived. Which is when Oppetit took off to do an MBA at Harvard Business School, where she spent two years, meeting “incredible and impressive women” and her future French husband who, she says, “was completely not my type – like no one I’d ever met before”.At school in Australia she had had a choice between learning Japanese or French – and opted for Japanese. “I thought it was more likely I’d become a sushi chef than marry a Frenchman.” Despite which they went back to Australia together and ended up in Singapore in 2014, where the now Mrs Oppetit worked for Apple in operations, taking up with Tim Cook’s old team. After a few years in Asia, the Oppetits – all 3 of them – agreed on going back to Europe and settled in London, where her husband had been brought up and had family. Oppetit, whose first daughter was three months old at the time, was adamant about going back to work. It was her sister in New York who recommended Via, which was setting up in Europe. “I wasn’t really a techie startup kind of person, but I thought what the hell, let’s find out more about it.” She went along, got interviewed all day long, and decided she wanted more. “You get a feeling,” she says. “It was a just a massive hit.” She joined Via in June 2017. The original plan was to launch Via in Europe in Amsterdam, which was well disposed on environmental grounds. But then Uber lost its licence in London\u0026nbspat the same time Via was granted a licence and it all kicked off right here\u0026nbspin April 2018. Drivers were queueing around the block to sign up. Literally (for once). The line was six to seven hours long and many had to be sent away to come back the next day. Oppetit would lose her voice every day trying to get drivers registered. “You’ve got a big tummy!” said one of the guys. “You can’t say that!” said another, more sensitively. She was five months pregnant at the time and didn’t object particularly. And she was sympathetic to the drivers. “Uber hadn’t had a lot of competition and the drivers were undervalued and badly treated. They wanted something else.” The projected figures for the end of year two\u0026nbspwere achieved in just one month. Business was exploding. “It felt like I was really using my MBA,” she said. “It felt real. It was madness, but in a good way.” So when she got the call, second-time motherhood or not,\u0026nbspshe knew she had to take the job. “I’m in if you really want it,” said her supportive husband. She specified she wouldn’t come back for two\u0026nbspmonths and had to have a month off around Christmas to show off\u0026nbspthe new baby to family in Australia. Since she came back at the end of August, it’s been “the two best months we’ve had at Via”. They’re now over 3\u0026nbspmillion rides.Maybe you really can have it all. Oppetit sees no contradiction between motherhood and managing a huge operation. “You just have to do what comes naturally.” The fact that she has two daughters makes a difference. “I want them to feel that they can do anything. And the advantage is they’re too young to be able to comment on my lifestyle choices.” The other upside is that now their father “has more opportunity to do what he thinks is right for a change”.Four out of the six senior management at Via are women. And out of 20 staff, 15 are from Australia or New Zealand. “They’re all on the big adventure,” Oppetit says. “And it turns out Australians are good at handling drivers, they have the right bubbly attitude.” ViaVan – born\u0026nbspout of a merger between Via in the US and Mercedes-Benz Vans in Europe – promotes car-sharing (or “pooling”). “It turns out Londoners are pretty happy sharing,” Oppetit says, “especially if it keeps the price down.” And it’s corner-to-corner rather than door-to-door. “You might have to walk a couple of blocks and they drop you off a block or two away,” but it saves on car journeys and cuts congestion. And the ideal model is a hybrid car or all-electric. Oppetit is even in favour of more cycling in the capital too. She sees bikes and Via as part of the same general eco-friendly tendency. ViaVan is now in four cities in Europe, including Milton Keynes. I used the app and took one of their rides to Euston. I had to wait less than two minutes. One share. The driver, like all drivers everywhere, complained about the traffic.A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

In other words, they’ve\u0026nbsphave moved before the current government, or a successor led by Jeremy Corbyn, act to force their hands.\u0026nbspThe similarity of what they’ve offered to do to proposals tabled by Labour is marked. The deal still requires ratification, but that’s a formality.

But the entire industry would be in the knackers yard without gambling. And it isn’t a big draw for the under 18s in the same way that football is.\u0026nbspHow much will it hurt that sport, which has been the main area of focus, although others are covered too? Football has behaved as a magic money tree ever since the launch of the Premiership, fuelled by the ever escalating size of the broadcast rights deals it has been able to secure.\u0026nbspGambling plays an important, but not central, role in making those rights profitable. The industry’s ads peppered the coverage of the last World Cup on commercial TV\u0026nbspand are heavily featured in internationals.\u0026nbspThey provide\u0026nbsprevenue streams for BT and Sky’s coverage of the Premiership\u0026nbspand European club tournaments too.\u0026nbspLosing them will hurt. But it won’t kill the golden goose.\u0026nbspOf far greater concern to them will be the interest in streaming games among web giants, something the Premier League has been doing everything in its power to foster.\u0026nbspAmazon bought a slightly odd looking package featuring two sets of games on bank holidays during the last rights auction. If it likes what it sees\u0026nbspand decides to deploy its big guns, the unhappiness created by the loss of a few gambling ads will pale by comparison. Amazon’s big guns are very big. It can out shoot anyone it wants to.Football’s bosses, its coaches, and its players, can thus be reassured that they’ll continue to be kept in the style to which they have become accustomed for the foreseeable future.\u0026nbspThis should be borne in mind as campaigners gear up for phase two.It has\u0026nbspalready been noted that the deal does not include either shirt sponsorship nor digital advertising around the pitch.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Don’t be fooled by the gambling lobbyNine in 10 pubs fail to prevent children gambling on their premisesGambling Commission figures released last week estimated that 430,000 people in the UK are problem gamblers.While the number has remained relatively stable, there are growing fears that 247 access to online gambling through apps, fuelled by ads before the watershed have put people at greater risk.Despite making billions in profits\u0026nbsplast year, the gambling industry contributes just £10m towards research and treatment – 0.1 per cent of turnover.\u0026nbspDr Wardle\u0026nbspdescribed the amount as a “pittance” compared with the amount needed to tackle gambling-related harm.She and a group of other leading experts and campaigners in the field are supporting a mandatory industry levy of 1 per cent of profits, which would bring in more than £130m a year.The Gambling Commission last week announced three operators of online casinos would pay a combined £14m for failing to properly protect vulnerable gamblers and prevent money laundering.Matt\u0026nbspZarb-Cousin\u0026nbspof the Campaign for Fairer Gambling said pressure had forced online gambling firms to act.“This is long overdue, but to be truly effective it must include all operators and should also commit to bans on shirt and league sponsorship, and pitch-side scrolling displays,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Equally, I want T-level students, that want to, to be able to go to university to do relevant technical degrees.”Mr Hinds will announce the next seven T-level courses to be taught from 2021,\u0026nbspwhich will include programmes in health, science, construction, and digital services.The first T-level courses will be taught in further education and post-16 providers from 2020.Speaking at an event in London this morning, Mr Hinds will add: “As a nation I’m afraid we’ve been technical education snobs. We’ve revered the academic but treated vocational as second class. When we do it well -\u0026nbsplaw, engineering, medicine -\u0026nbspthen we don’t even call it vocational.“Why has this has been tolerated for so long? I think the reason is the “OPC” problem. For so many opinion formers, commentators and, yes, politicians: vocational courses are for ‘other people’s children’.”Tom Berwick, chief executive of the Federation of Awarding Bodies (FAB), who has previously raised concerns about the implementation of the T-levels, said: “The principle of a genuinely world-class and equitable technical route for young people will be broadly welcomed.”He added: “However, the elephant in the room is securing proper investment in further education which has seen its funding cut significantly in the last decade.“The government needs a more coherent plan post-18 that links increased investment in productivity with better incentives for providers and employers to meet the skills the country needs.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators for and against Brexit protest opposite the Houses of ParliamentTheresa May has suffered an unprecedented defeat after the government was found to be in contempt of parliament for refusing to publish key Brexit papers.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

Award voters have clearly embraced Adam McKay’s Big Short follow-up, featuring an “unrecognisable” Christian Bale as former vice president\u0026nbspDick Cheney, after the first screening that rocked Hollywood a few weeks back. Its placement here – with noms for Bale, Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell – establishes the late awards race entrant as a firm frontrunner. Jacob StolworthyPerhaps it’s proof the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) is widening its scope when it comes to the Golden Globes, or simply a testament to how much Ryan Coogler’s blockbuster resonated with audiences, but Black Panther has become the second superhero film ever to receive a Best Picture nomination at the awards. That’s after last year’s rather tongue-in-cheek nomination for Deadpool in the Musical or Comedy category. Of course, that didn’t translate into an Oscar nomination for Ryan Reynold’s antihero, but could the hype behind Black Panther be enough to push to the centre of the awards conversation? Clarisse LoughreyAll hail, Queen Olivia. Unforgivably overlooked for her unflinching turn in Tyrannosaur in 2012, the British actor won a Globe five years later for her role in the spy TV drama The Night Manager. She now gets her first film nod for Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite, which re-imagines the reign of Queen Anne as an absurdist farce with a lesbian twist. Quite right, too. As Queen Anne, she’s brilliantly funny, never missing a beat as she veers wildly between maudlin and child-like wonderment. A lot of the talk will be about Lady Gaga, but, really, this is the performance to cherish the most. Patrick SmithConsidering it won Venice Film Festival’s coveted Golden Lion award – the same trophy won by The Shape of Water last year –\u0026nbspAlfonso Cuarón’s masterpiece seemed destined to overcome its foreign-language status to be nominated in the main film category. No such luck. While Cuarón received recognition as director and screenwriter, Roma’s been plonked in the Best Foreign Language category (alongside fellow gem\u0026nbspShoplifters),\u0026nbspwith Best Film - Drama being reserved for higher-profile titles including Bohemian Rhapsody and\u0026nbspBlack Panther (see above). While the Oscars are more likely to embrace Roma in its\u0026nbspmain film category,\u0026nbspthis has\u0026nbspsurely dented its chances of beating the likes of A Star Is Born and Vice to the top prize come February. Jacob StolworthyFemale directors have been shut out (again)You would think the HFPA would take notice after Natalie Portman cracked a joke about the total lack of female directors nominated at least year’s Golden Globes. Presenting the award for Best Director, she commented: “And here are all the male nominees”. Whoever is chosen to present this year’s award would do well to repeat Portman’s statement: once again, no female director has been nominated in the category, and no film directed by a woman has been nominated for Best Motion Picture. For an awards season that elsewhere looks encouragingly erse, with recognition in the film categories for the likes of Black Panther, If Beale Street Could Talk, BlackKklansman, and Crazy Rich Asians, this feels like an unnecessary embarrassment, especially when Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here and Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace were both released this year. Clarisse Loughrey Golden Globes 2019 nominations list in fullIt’s become something of a cliché to insist this every awards season\u0026nbsp– but this year they’re genuinely on the march. Amongst the film nominees, Rachel Weisz (The Favourite), Claire Foy (First Man), and Richard E Grant (Can You Ever Forgive Me?) earned supporting actor nods, while Christian Bale (Vice), Emily Blunt (Mary Poppins Returns), Rosamund Pike (A Private War) and Olivia Colman (The Favourite) were recognised for their leading roles. As for TV, Richard Madden, who starred in Jed Mercurio’s phenomenally successful BBC drama Bodyguard, was nominated in the TV drama category, while Benedict Cumberbatch (Patrick Melrose), Hugh Grant (A Very English Scandal) and Thandie Newton (Westworld) were nominated elsewhere. It was a shame not to see Killing Eve’s Jodie Comer nominated alongside her brilliant co-star Sandra Oh, and Florence Pugh was overlooked for her stunning turn in The Little Drummer Girl, but we’re just nit-picking now. Alexandra PollardWidows becomes this award season’s major snubA lot of people will be scanning the nominations list this year, baffled not to find a single nomination for Steve McQueen’s Widows. It’s an electric thriller, which received a huge amount of critical acclaim upon its release, and features one of this year’s most formidable casts. It’s disappointing not only to see the film omitted but also to see the Golden Globes sleep on the always excellent Viola Davis, in what may be one of her finest roles yet. Clarisse LoughreyAt 15, Eighth Grade star Elsie Fisher isn’t quite the youngest lead actress nominee in the Golden Globes’s 74-year history – that honour goes to Beasts of the Southern Wild star Quvenzhané Wallis, who was 9 when she was nominated. If Fisher wins, though, she’ll be the youngest ever winner, surpassing Children of a Lesser God’s Marlee Matlin, who was 21 when she won the award in 1987. Fisher is raw and magnetic as a struggling middle schooler in Bo Burnham’s acclaimed directorial debut, having been cast after Burnham spotted her on YouTube. Alexandra PollardYou can catch up with our live blog running through all the nominations as they were announced below.It\u0027s not just films being nominated today, of course - the Golden Globes are all about the small box also. Expect to see Killing Eve, Atlanta and Homecoming in contention.Every year, awards season becomes a two-horse race and this one\u0027s no different. Are you Team A Star Is Born or Team Roma? Now\u0027s the time to decide.Obviously Roma is the first true\u0026nbspawards chance for Netflix in the film\u0026nbspcategories. Expect to see Alfonso Cuaron nommed for Best Director too alongside the likes of Spike Lee (BlackKklansman) and Bradders for A Star is Born.As ever, expect no women to be nominated for Best Director, even though Debra Granik (Leave No Trace) and Lynne Ramsay (You Were Never Really Here) should be given all the trophies.Important-y boring stuff to note - the Globes are split into two categories: drama and musicalcomedy but for some reason, the quite-clearly-a-musical A Star Is Born is competing in the... drama category. Makes sense, huh?The Favourite, Crazy Rich Asians, Green Book and Vice, which stars an unrecognisable Christian Bale as Dick Cheney, to name but a few.I\u0027m just keeping my fingers crossed for film of the year,\u0026nbspGAME NIGHT.Even though it\u0027s not out for a few weeks, Mary Poppins Returns has most likely been seen by nostalgic\u0026nbspaward\u0026nbspvoters so a nomination is a sure bet.The big question is: will Queen film Bohemian Rhapsody get a nod? (Most) critics didn\u0027t like it, audiences loved it, yadda yadda. Time will tell.If it\u0027s going to get anything, it\u0027s for Freddie Mercury star Rami Malek who\u0027ll face competition from the aforementioned Bale, Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali (both for Green Book) and Robert Redford for *his last screen role*\u0026nbspThe Old Man and the Gun.Actress-wise, it looks like Olivia Colman\u0027s to lose\u0026nbspwho is long overdue international awards success tbh. She\u0027s come a looooong way since Peep Show.The 76th Annual Golden Globe Awards ceremony will air on 6 Jan 2019, presented by Killing Eve star Sandra Oh and Brooklyn Nine-Nine‘s Andy Samberg.Created with Sketch.

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources.

It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time.

But, argue\u0026nbspJohn Curtice\u0026nbspand his co-authors in a new book edited by Philip Cowley and Denis Kavanagh, the real Brexit referendum actually happened a year laterClick to followThe IndependentThe social geography of the 2017 general election was shaped by attitudes towards BrexitIf voters agreed with the prime minister that the 2017 general election was about Brexit, then – given that her vision of Britain’s future relationship with the EU was widely regarded as representing a “hard” Brexit (prioritising control of immigration over continued membership of the EU single market) – we might expect her party to have advanced more strongly in places where the previous year a relatively high proportion had voted to leave the EU.Our analysis suggests this is precisely what happened. The higher the estimated vote for Leave in 2016, the more the Conservative vote increased, while support for the party actually fell back on average in places where Leave failed to secure at least 45 per cent of the vote.\u0026nbspThe link between Labour’s performance and the strength of the Leave vote in 2016 is much weaker, a finding that might be thought to reflect the party’s relatively ambiguous position on Brexit.How Europe became the funeral pyre for Tory leadersThere was only a three-point difference between the increase in the Labour vote in places where 60 per cent or more voted to Leave and the equivalent figure for constituencies where less than 45 per cent voted to Leave – far less than the corresponding difference of 12 points in the Conservative performance.Even so, between them these two patterns are sufficiently strong that in seats where more than 60 per cent voted to Leave, there was on average a net (total vote) swing of 0.8 per cent from Labour to the Conservatives, even though everywhere else in England and Wales Labour’s vote increased more than that of the Conservatives.Where did the Ukip vote go?A key reason why the link between the Conservative performance and the strength of the Leave vote is much stronger than that for Labour lies in the impact on the two parties’ performances of the collapse in the Ukip vote.Ukip’s share of the vote in the 2015 election was much larger in areas where Leave did well in the referendum. The decline in Ukip support two years later was almost invariably greatest where the party had previously been strongest. If those who voted Ukip in 2015 (nearly all of whom voted to Leave in 2016) were now particularly inclined to switch to the Conservatives, this could have served to boost the Conservative performance in constituencies that voted heavily to Leave.Indeed, while Labour\u0026nbspappears to have won some of the voters that Ukip lost, the Conservatives apparently gained many more.Ukip in 2017 was almost invariably greatest in areas where the party had been strongest before (Getty)Nevertheless, the collapse in Ukip support is far from being the whole explanation for the strong Conservative performance in areas keenest on leaving the EU. Even when we take into account how heavily Ukip support fell, the Conservatives still performed better where the Leave vote was stronger in 2016.Where did Remain and Leave voters go? The Conservative Party did not do well in places where Leave was strong in 2016 only because of the pattern of switching among\u0026nbspformer Ukip voters rather, Leave voters more generally seem to have been drawn into voting Conservative at this election, while Remain voters tilted towards Labour.Support for Ukip in 2015 and for Leave in 2016 varied substantially by age and educational background. Both were particularly popular with older people and those with few or no formal educational qualifications, while younger people and graduates tended to shun Ukip and vote Remain. This pattern was reflected in the Conservative and Labour votes in 2017.Created with Sketch.EU referendum - in pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A woman in a wheelchair with British and European Union flags shows her support for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union on the day of the EU Referendum in GibraltarA polling station being used in the EU referendum at Batley Town Hall in the constituency Labour MP Jo CoxPeople arrive to vote in the EU Referendum at the Library where British MP Jo Cox was shot and fatally wounded last week in BirstallA man arrives to vote at a polling station for the Referendum on the European Union in north LondonVoters queue to enter a polling station at Trinity Church in Golders Green in LondonBritish Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha Cameron leave after voting in the EU Referendum at Central Methodist Hall, Westminster Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn cast his vote at a polling station at Pakeman Primary School in IslingtonChelsea pensioners arrive at a polling station near to the Royal Chelsea HospitalA woman wearing an I\u0027m In t-shirt, promoting the official Remain campaign, leaves a polling station in LondonPeople queuing outside a polling station on Amott Road in LondonScotland\u0027s First Minister and Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell, react as leave after casting their votes at a polling station at Broomhouse Community Hall in east GlasgowA man wearing a European themed cycling jersey leaves after voting at a polling station for the Referendum on the European Union in north LondonUkip leader Nigel Farage arrives to cast his vote at Cudham Church of England Primary School in Biggin Hill, KentJustice Secretary and prominent \u0027Vote Leave\u0027 campaigner Michael Gove poses with his wife Sarah Vine after voting in the European Union referendum at their local polling station in KensingtonNuns leave a polling station after voting in the EU Referendum in LondonPeople arrive to cast their ballots in the EU Referendum in Gibraltar.

There is a corresponding, though much weaker tendency in the opposite direction for Labour. At the same time, the Conservatives performed less well and Labour better in seats with more young adults – though once we take this into account, there is no indication, despite the prominence given to Labour’s manifesto promise to scrap tuition fees for students at English universities, that constituencies with large numbers of students were particularly likely to swing towards the party.The social geography of Conservative and Labour performance at this election was primarily, albeit not entirely, a consequence of the role played by attitudes towards Brexit in shaping how people voted.What about the economy?Traditionally, the state of the economy has played a central role in how people vote. In 2015, for example, the Conservatives clearly performed worse where unemployment was highest or had increased most, and where household incomes were relatively low. At this election, however, if anything the opposite was the case.Revolutionary study into voter \u0027clans\u0027 holds key to 2022 electionThe worse local economic circumstances were, the better the Conservatives did and the worse Labour did. For instance, Conservative support increased on average by 5.8 points where the constituency unemployment rate increased between 2015 and 2017, compared with 4.9 points where it fell. The equivalent figures for Labour were 9.8 points and 10.4 points respectively. Moreover, despite a continued squeeze on public spending and a promise from the Conservatives of more austerity to come that could mean cuts in public sector jobs, there was, in contrast to 2015, no particular relationship between Conservative or Labour performance and the local prevalence of public sector employees.Did the antisemitism row hurt Labour?Not that the focus on Brexit meant that nothing else mattered. Jeremy Corbyn’s views on the Middle East have attracted particular controversy, with critics accusing the Labour leader of being too sympathetic to iniduals and groups opposed to Israel, including some widely regarded as extremist. There were related accusations that, under Corbyn’s leadership, the Labour Party had dealt inadequately with allegations that some party members have made antisemitic statements. These issues appear to have made a difference. On average Labour’s vote increased by 11.6 points in constituencies where more than 4 per cent are Muslim, compared with an average increase of 9.6 points elsewhere in England and Wales. This difference is not accounted for by the tendency of the Leave vote to be lower in seats with more Muslims. Meanwhile, and by contrast, the Labour vote only rose by 8.8 points on average across the 10 constituencies with the largest Jewish populations, even though seven of these 10 seats are in London, where Labour generally performed relatively well.Did social class drive the voting?However, the fallout from the EU referendum was most important in shaping the geography of Conservative and Labour performance. In so doing, the contest served to reduce some of the traditional isions in British elections. For example, although working-class voters had traditionally been the bedrock of Labour support, they had also been more likely to vote Leave and to vote for Ukip. Thus, thanks to its gains among such voters, at this election Conservative support increased by as much as 9.4 points in seats where more than 13 per cent are engaged in a routine manual occupation, compared with just 1.3 points where fewer than 10 per cent have a routine job. Conversely, Labour’s support increased by just 9.1 points in relatively working-class seats, but by 10.7 points where relatively few have a routine job.\u0026nbspWhat happened to the northsouth ide?Equally, the northsouth ide in Britain’s electoral geography also narrowed somewhat, the first time it has done so since 1997. A relatively weak Conservative performance and a relatively strong Labour performance across the largely more pro-Remain south of England\u0026nbspmeant that on average there was as much as a 3.9 point swing from Conservative to Labour there.In contrast, the swing to Labour was only 1.3 in the north of England and 0.7\u0026nbspin the heavily pro-Leave Midlands. One striking consequence of this ergence is that Conservative support is now higher in the Midlands than in the south of England, not least, but also not solely, because pro-Remain and ethnically erse London has now become something of a Labour citadel.Paxman returned to Newsnight to interrogate May and Corbyn (Getty)Despite initial appearances, therefore, this clearly was not an election that heralded a return to the familiar patterns of two-party politics.Do constituency boundaries hold the key?But what about the notion that the makeup of parliament is as much to do with the way constituency boundaries have been drawn as anything else? That question is particularly topical, given current proposals for boundary reform. \u0026nbspThe present constituency boundaries are biased against the Conservatives, but this is compensated for by the more efficient distribution of their vote.Surprising though the failure of the Conservatives to win an overall majority last year might have seemed, was the tally of seats won by each party significantly different from what we might have anticipated given the shares of the vote each of them secured?\u0026nbspThe traditional way of addressing this question has been to compare the actual outcome in seats with what would have happened if in every constituency each party’s share of the vote had increased or fallen in line with the change in its overall share of the vote across Britain as a whole – that is, uniform change.However, applying this method becomes difficult when, as happened in 2015 and again in 2017, there is a substantial change in the level of support for a party, such as the SNP, that only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there. In these circumstances the change in that party’s share of the Britain-wide vote will inevitably be but a pale reflection of the actual rise or fall in its support in the part of the UK where it stood.It is therefore better to use as our initial benchmark what would have happened if support for all of the main Britain-wide parties had increased or fallen in every constituency in England and Wales in line with the overall change in their support in those two parts of the UK combined. For each seat in Scotland, meanwhile, we calculate what would have happened if the rise or fall in each party’s support had been in line with the change in its share of the Scotland-wide total.On the basis of these assumptions, the Conservatives would have won 323 seats (instead of 318), Labour 259 (262), the SNP 37 (35), the Liberal Democrat nine (12), Plaid Cymru three (four) and the Greens one (one), while, of course, there would be 18 other MPs from Northern Ireland. None of these figures are\u0026nbspvery different from what actually transpired and, above all, the Conservatives would still have failed to secure an overall majority – albeit they would have been only three rather than eight seats short.What about Scotland?That projected Conservative tally includes 11 seats in Scotland. However, if the increase in the Conservative vote north of the border had been in line with the lower increase in England and Wales – and the fall in SNP support had not happened – the Conservatives would have won only two Scottish seats. Thus, in the absence of the distinctive outcome in Scotland, the Conservatives would have won only 314 seats. To that extent, the distinctive result in Scotland proved to be crucial to the arithmetic of the new House of Commons.SNP only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there (Getty)What were the other factors?However, although the overall tally of seats for each party was more or less in line with what might have been expected given the changes in their overall shares of the vote, there were lots of seats where the outcome was at variance with what would have happened if the movements in party support had been the same everywhere.What if Nick Clegg had gone into coalition with Labour in 2010?No fewer than 36 seats changed hands that would not have done so under those circumstances, while 16 constituencies were held against the tide. Most of these outcomes can in fact be accounted for by one or other of the systematic patterns of variation our analysis has identified, including the tendency for the Conservatives to perform better in seats with a relatively large Leave vote and Labour to do likewise in seats where Remain polled relatively well, the Conservatives’ ability on occasion to squeeze the other unionist parties in Scotland, and the willingness of some of those who might otherwise have voted Labour to make a tactical switch to the (pro-Remain) Liberal Democrats. In short, much of the significant variation in party performance was linked in some way or other to the fallout from either the 2016 EU referendum or the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.Dem leader Tim Farron narrowly retained his seat with 8.4 per cent swing to the Tories (Getty)This still leaves us with the observation that for the third time in a row, the electoral system failed to deliver the winning party a substantial overall majority (and, indeed, on two occasions any majority at all).The system’s ability to generate safe overall majorities has long been regarded as a hallmark of the single member plurality system (often referred to as “first past the post”) and the resulting clarity of the link between the outcome of an election and who forms the government is often cited as a major justification for its continued use.It might be thought the explanation is that, at 2.5 points, the Conservative lead over Labour in terms of votes across Great Britain as a whole was a relatively narrow one. It was certainly much narrower than the seven point leads that the Conservatives enjoyed in 2010 and 2015. Yet it was larger than the leads (in Great Britain) that the Conservatives enjoyed in 1955 (1.9 points) and 1970 (2.3 points) or Labour did in 1964 (1.9 points), yet those three contests all resulted in an overall majority, including in two instances a relatively safe one.Historical precedent apparently suggests that the Conservative lead should have been sufficient to give the party an overall majority.What about variable constituency sizes?One consequence of the prime minister’s decision to secure a Commons vote for an early election is that the contest had to be fought on the same constituency boundaries as in 2015 and not on the new boundaries the various parliamentary boundary commissions were in the midst of preparing in readiness for an election in 2020.The resulting inequality in the sizes of constituencies was certainly a disadvantage for the Conservatives. The average electorate in constituencies they won at this election was 74,451, whereas in seats won by Labour it was 70,529. The difference of some 3,920 people was around 520 bigger than it had been two years previously.The gap may have been increased somewhat by the government’s decision in 2015 to speed up the introduction of inidual electoral registration, which resulted in particularly sharp drops in registration in some typically Labour-held constituencies with large numbers of students. But the gap was then narrowed somewhat by the applications to be added to the register many (and especially younger) voters made after its initial compilation in December 2016. These added 2,300 names on average to the register in constituencies that Labour won, compared with just 1,600 on average in seats won by the Conservatives.Did voter turnout make a difference?However, inequalities in the registered electorate are not the only consideration that we have to bear in mind in considering the sizes of constituencies. Bias might also arise if turnout is lower in seats held by one party than it is in those won by its opponents. Indeed, turnout was on average some four points lower on average in seats won by Labour at this election (66.5 per cent) than it was in those won by the Conservatives (70.7 per cent).\u0026nbspAFPGetty)That said, this was a noticeably smaller gap than in 2015, for turnout increased on average by 3.8 points in seats Labour won, but by only 2.0 points in those won by the Conservatives. As a result, at 5,675 votes, the difference between Conservative and Labour-held seats in terms of the total number of votes cast was actually smaller at this election than it had been in the same two sets of seats two years previously (6,541).To this we need to add one other consideration. The relative success of the Conservatives in seats with a relatively high Leave vote meant that the increase in the party’s vote was often greater in more working-class seats outside of London and the south of England, whose populations have grown less rapidly and thus tend to have lower than average electorates.For example, Conservative support increased on average by as much as 7.3 points in seats in which fewer than 72,000 people were registered to vote, compared with just 4.3 points where more than 77,000 names appeared on the register. Similarly, while the Conservative vote increased on average by 9.7 points where turnout was less than 65 per cent, it increased by just 3.2 points where turnout was above 71 per cent. As a result, there was a noticeable reduction in the extent to which the Conservative vote was concentrated in constituencies where more people turned out to vote.Created with Sketch.

The Labour Party was ahead of the Conservatives by more than 40 points in 27 per cent of seats that it won, while the Conservative Party was that far ahead of Labour in just 12 per cent of the constituencies that it won.\u0026nbspIn short, whatever disadvantage the Conservatives suffered as a result of inequalities in the sizes of constituencies tended to be compensated by them having a more efficiently distributed vote.John\u0026nbspCurtice, Strathclyde University, Stephen Fisher, Trinity College, Oxford, and Robert Ford and Patrick English, University of Manchester, are authors of The Results Analysed, in ‘The British General Election of 2017’, edited by Philip Cowley and Dennis\u0026nbspKavanagh, from which this article is extractedShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

For decades protesters have demanded they be repurposed as social housing.\u0026nbspOliver Bennett unravels the highs and lows of a phenomenon with global foundationsClick to followThe IndependentSquatters occupy Centre Point, advocating its use as a residential block instead of an office in the SeventiesCentre Point must be one of the most isive landmarks in London. Erected in 1966, it instantly dominated the West End and while some celebrated it –\u0026nbsparchitect Erno\u0026nbspGoldfinger called it “London’s first pop art skyscraper”\u0026nbspand amazingly, likened it in spirit to The Beatles and Mary Quant – the brainchild of reclusive developer Harry Hyams has had a mixed reception over its 52 years.But perhaps Centre Point’s most curious fate has been to remain more or less empty. It never fully worked as offices. In 1972 Camden Council tried to requisition it. Harold Wilson wanted to nationalise it. It was occupied for a weekend by housing activists in 1974 – one was Labour politician Jack Dromey, Harriet Harman’s husband. A major homelessness charity was named after it. Then a Grade-II listing and a recherché desire for Brutalist\u0026nbspicons (it came from the feted drawing board of Richard Seifert’s master architect, George Marsh) bought its zig-zag façade back into favourable view and it become luxury flats, synced to the new Crossrail development. What could go wrong?Labour mulls plan to force landowners to sell cheap to stateWell, the Centre Point curse has struck again. In October its developer Almacantar decided that offers on its remaining luxury flats were “derisory” and “detached from reality”, and decided to take them off the market. So Centre Point has now cemented and updated its footnote in London folklore as one of the capital’s benighted\u0026nbsp“ghost towers”.From Centre Point to the Shard, from Battersea Power Station to the sky-reaching baubles of Nine Elms\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspeven in The Independent’s old neighbourhood in City Road – the past six years or so has seen London become filled with tall glass and steel icons\u0026nbspthat are conspicuously under-occupied: built in a time of optimism for an overseas market and now languishing unsold or OLE: owned and left empty.The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supplyThe immediate prognosis is not good. It has been said that half the 1,900 luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, and it’s estimated that there are around 2,500 to 3,000 unsold but complete luxury new builds, with many still entering the market. Property analyst Molior London noted that sales of new homes in London fell by a fifth last year, and that the number\u0026nbspof unsold apartments continues to grow. And the more expensive they are, the more likely they are to be unoccupied: 39 per cent\u0026nbspfor homes worth £1m to £5m, 64 per cent\u0026nbspfor those places over £5m. There are reports of people trying hard to sell and to complicate matters, there’s the impending known-unknown that is Brexit.It seems an odd characteristic of the past 10\u0026nbspyears that things have been so difficult for buyers in one direction and so easy in the other. These luxury apartments are commonly between £1,000-£1,500 per sq ft, against the average UK price of £211 per sq ft. But, their posh locations aside, one of their key drivers has been the post credit-crunch migration of capital.“We’ve seen an\u0026nbspera of low interest and cash into assets,” says Henry Pryor, a property-buying agent. “When money is unsafe, or doesn’t inflate, the rich put it into other things: cars, art, houses.”The high-water mark was about six or seven years ago when then mayor Boris Johnson went on a spending spree and encouraged others to do likewise. London became what Pryor calls a “speculation paradise” – and that spike is now heading in the opposite direction.So, if housing is a free market that can go up as well as down, why does Almacantar not take the hit with its Centre Point flats and sell them for less? “It doesn’t work like that,” says Michael Ball of the Waterloo Community Development Group and a seasoned housing activist. “The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supply.”Battersea\u0026nbspPower Station sat empty for\u0026nbspyears but is now being developed as a retail\u0026nbspand residential space (AFPGetty)The seeds of the current zombie-tower wobbles came with George Osborne’s stamp duty reforms in 2014, which took the froth off the market, leading to developer grumbles – wasn’t he one of us, they wailed? Then the long lead-time of developments began to show as a significant constraint, for as well as “skyscraper syndrome”\u0026nbsp(where a glut of tall building supposedly presages a downturn) there’s also the problem that many developments are financed by upfront sales.“Many were designed to be sold off-plan to release capital for building,” says Roarie Scarisbrick of Property Vision. “Now people are waiting until properties are actually built, which squeezes developers badly.” Increased scrutiny on money laundering may also play a part which, as Pryor says, “is still too easy”.Plus, some high-end properties were simply never meant to be\u0026nbsplived in but just to be “gold bars in the sky” as Ball puts it. It’s hard to find out how many of London’s luxury flats are truly unoccupied. “You can look at census, but it’s tough to find out numbers,” says Ball. “I don’t think we know the extent of it. The records are really poor.” And as ever with property, the winners crow and the losers remain silent.There are a few other factors to observe, including the move of real estate into a high-end branded fashion buy, as the Candy Brothers did with their developments. “That aspect took me by surprise,” says Pryor. “It turned out that people wanted to be able to specify that they had a Candy apartment as they sat in Monaco, as if boasting about owning a Bulgari watch or a Montblanc pen.”There’s also an argument that some parts of London, such as Eaton Square in Belgravia, have long acted as pieds-à-terre for the rich and were probably ghost-like in the 18th and 19th centuries. “Remember, in Downton Abbey they occasionally come down to ‘Grantham House’ in London,” says Adam Challis, head of residential research at real estate company JLL.“That old ‘country seat and the London house’ combination is now a global rather than national phenomenon, and a London apartment became part of a wider property portfolio.” He points out that while these spectral apartments may appear unoccupied, it could well be that their ultra-rich owners may only use them for six to eight weeks a year.I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places.\u0026nbspIt would be a disasterNine Elms is a typical new London “owned and left empty”\u0026nbspzone. A swathe of land between Battersea and Vauxhall, it was a low-value industrial hinterland dominated by the Cold Store –\u0026nbspa piece of charismatic dereliction used in an episode of The Sweeney – and the only respite being London’s flower market. Now it’s a parade of gleaming hi-tech towers.“When private developers get hold of the land it leaps in value tenfold,” says Michael Ball. So in a way, however many apartments have been sold here, it may have already fulfilled its profit promise. Sometimes, adds Scarisbrick, such places are not even designed for full occupancy. “I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places,” he says. “It would be a disaster.”US politicians question Trump\u0027s ties to scandal-struck Panama projectHow drones are revolutionising construction and real estateThere are precedents to all this. In earlier eras luxury housing went up as well as down, and lost out to new tastes. Michael Ball says that St Georges Buildings\u0026nbspin the Elephant and Castle area was built as a luxury development in the 1880s. “By the post-war era it had become squatted, then became social housing. Now it’s luxury housing again.”The ghost tower phenomenon isn’t confined to London or the UK. There are similar qualms in South Africa, Canada, New York and Mumbai, where a string of luxury skyscrapers in the Worli and Prabhadevi districts have recently struggled to find buyers. Emptiness is a fact of life in the construction industry and just last month it was reported that a fifth of China’s new housing is empty: an extraordinary total of 50 million ghost homes. But another aspect of construction, says Challis, is that it attracts “huge economic growth. So empty homes are an endemic feature of the world’s most important cities.”The extent of London’s ghost towers may even have been overestimated. “Evidence from the LSE for Sadiq Khan showed that unlived-in apartments were actually under 1 per cent\u0026nbspof new build properties,” says Peter Murray of NLA, who adds that London properties are still selling well in Singapore and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, London has 510 tall buildings in the pipeline: up from 455 in 2016. Even with its current depredations, property in London is still considered a safer bet than many financial vehicles.But there’s no doubt that ghost towers fail the political and social smell test: as visible reminders of disposable wealth in a city where most can’t get a foothold.So, given that ghost towers and unsold luxury flats currently exist, whither their luxurious wenge-floored acres, gyms, pools and media rooms? Will developers have fire sales just to get rid of them? (Molior London has said that 10-15 per cent\u0026nbspreductions are typical and 20-30 per cent\u0026nbspreductions achievable, and that it would take more than\u0026nbspthree years to sell the glut of ultra-luxury flats at the current rate).Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It still appears to be affecting every customer\u0026nbspof O2.As well as the network\u0027s own users, customers of other carriers that rely on O2 – such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff\u0026nbsp– are also unable to get online.O2 said the problem was affecting only internet\u0026nbspconnections, and some texts. But many customers said they have no signal at all, and calls are not getting through either.The problems have also hit systems that seem entirely unrelated, such as live updating bus arrivals boards, which rely on O2\u0027s\u0026nbspdata network to report where they are.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Our technical teams are investigating.We apologise for any inconvenience. Updates will be shared here as soon they are available.A similar explanation was tweeted by O2\u0027s official account.We are aware our customers are unable to use data this morning, it posted.\u0026nbspOur technical teams are working on the issue with high priority. We are really sorry and working as hard and as fast as we can to fix this.It then posted a follow-up explaining the problem.Outage Update: One of our 3rd party suppliers has identified a software issue in their system, it tweeted.\u0026nbspOur technical teams are working extremely hard to resolve this. We\u0027d encourage you to use Wi-Fi wherever you can and we are really sorry.If you have been hit by the issues, there may be\u0026nbsplittle you can do. But here are some things to try in the meantime.While many people switch to GiffGaff or O2 for the deals, it is far from the most reliable of the data networks.According to Which, EE has the most reliable 4G, with people being able to get faster connections 87 per cent of the time. It also has faster mobile web connections than O2, according to the same survey.WiFi\u0026nbspconnections are still working, which might be little consolation if you\u0027re already out and trying to connect to the internet.But it is worth trying to see if you can get online using one: remember, for instance, you can get online at Tube stations by using their WiFi connections, and there might be open networks available if you are near a business. O2 customers may even have access to BT Openzone, which borrows people\u0027s in-home WiFi connections to allow you to get onto the internet.Once you\u0027re at work, you might also find there\u0027s a WiFi connection for employees that you\u0027ve never had to use because you can usually\u0026nbspget data. Now that you can\u0027t get data, it might be helpful to use that instead.When you\u0027re trying to fix your own data, there\u0027s not a great deal you can do. Sometimes, switching the connection on and off sometimes fixes problems like these – but isn\u0027t working this time around.Instead, you might just have to stay glued to The Independent\u0027s coverage for notification of when the network gets back up again.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That makes life challenging for us.OnePlus aims to go mainstream as it launches its ‘iPhone killer’“5G is going to open up a lot of new ways people use their smartphone – the increased speed combined with the increased capacity mean your smartphone can now truly be the centre of a connected experience, for everything from fitness to home automation.”The announcement that OnePlus’s\u0026nbspphone will be the first available in Europe comes despite the fact that other manufacturers – including giants like Samsung – have promised to bring their own devices to the network as soon as possible.Asked whether he was concerned that rivals would beat OnePlus to market despite its claim to being the first, Mr Lau said that there are “obviously no guarantees” but that his company were best positioned to be ready with the cutting-edge technology first.“We started working on 5G in 2016, and developed an R\u0026ampD lab with Qualcomm in 2017,” he said. “OnePlus has always used Qualcomm 800 series chipsets as part of our flagship-only strategy, and this is part of the reason for the excellent relationship we have with one of the world’s leading chipset providers.“No-one is better positioned than OnePlus to take the lead with 5G. We don’t really look at what others are doing in the industry, we’re focused on providing the best possible experience for our users, and we recognised early on that 5G would be a huge opportunity for revolution.”Others, such as Apple, are rumoured to have sat out the decision until at least 2020, allowing other companies to take the first leap – and deal with the potential for the kinds of major infrastructure problems that have blighted similar rollouts in the past.

Those early adopters know that, as with the launch of 4G, there won’t be 5G coverage everywhere at first but it’ll be a rapid rollout from networks.”Proponents have regularly suggested that 5G could change the way that people use phones, allowing people to take advantage of instant and reliable connections to create new forms of experience. Mr\u0026nbspLau\u0026nbspechoed those claims,\u0026nbspsuggesting they may be transformative in ways that the company has not even expected.“When you look at the history of smartphones, they’re used in ways today which no-one had designed them for originally,” he said.\u0026nbsp”5G will be the same – the possibilities will open up in front of us as people experiment with how to combine speed and capacity – everything from gaming through to work or fitness will change. We’re constantly doing research with users and partners to ensure we have a fast and smooth experience no-matter what.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

If plague evolved in the mega-settlements, then when people started dying from it, the settlements would have been abandoned and destroyed.”As the plague evolved, it would have spread around the continent along newly developed trade routes made possible by wheeled transport.\u0026nbspUltimately, it would have arrived in the northernmost parts of Europe, and the small village in which the woman sampled by this study lived.The plague has devastated Europe for millennia, from outbreaks in the Bronze Age through to the Black Death pandemic that killed up to 60 per cent of the continent’s population in the Middle Ages.Dr Rasmussen and his team are trying to track down the\u0026nbspearliest strains of plague to emerge, using ancient DNA strands to trace its lineage from the relatively harmless bacteria that preceded it.The strain still in existence today erged from other varieties around 5,000 years ago, and the 5,700-year-old specimen is likely a closer representation of those implicated in the first outbreaks.Though Dr Rasmussen says they are yet to find a “smoking gun” for their theory about early mega-settlement outbreaks, they would like to test remains from those sites in order to test the idea.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Tory MPs don’t like it because we can’t get out of it except by signing a permanent trade deal that guarantees the same thing. Even Jeremy Corbyn has criticised it because we have no way out of it except with the agreement of the EU.\u0026nbspNow she could tell her MPs that avoiding a hard border in Ireland is something to which the UK should be committed anyway. But a lot of them don’t agree. They think it would be a price worth paying for a “real” Brexit – although they tend to argue in public that a hard border could be managed by technology so no one would notice it.\u0026nbspSo, instead, Theresa May is telling her rebels that they can have a veto over the backstop, should it ever be needed.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s backstop veto plan ‘would rip up withdrawal agreement’This is spin. She has written into the withdrawal agreement a choice at the end of the transition period, the end of 2020. If the long-term trade deal with the EU has not been negotiated by then, and it seems likely that it would not have been, the UK would then face a choice between the backstop or a one-off extension to the transition period. It would be inconceivable that any government would make that decision without consulting parliament, so May’s “offer” is no more than a statement of the obvious.\u0026nbspAnd it does not get round the fact that the backstop will still be the fallback option. If, in 2020, the UK opts to extend the transition period, at most by two years to the end of 2022, and if when that expires there is still no long-term trade deal, then the backstop will come into effect anyway.\u0026nbspThe only way out of it would be for the UK to repudiate the withdrawal agreement. This is an international treaty and we have a sovereign right as a nation to pull out of any treaty, but that would have serious consequences. Any country that goes around binning international agreements would become, in effect, a rogue state, and other countries will be wary of signing new deals with it. If we did that, it would not be possible to negotiate any kind of trade deal with the EU.\u0026nbspThis was what many journalists and Brussels officials thought the prime minister meant by her offer: she would be giving MPs the chance to repudiate an agreement to which they had just agreed. That is the trouble with spin. If you are trying to pretend something is what it is not, people might assume you mean something else altogether.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

This means the Lib Dems now have 11 MPs, instead of 12, in the Commons.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: “We respect what we know was a difficult decision for Stephen ahead of next week’s vote and are sorry to see him go.\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats are clear that we will be voting against Theresa May’s deal. The Liberal Democrats have campaigned for an exit from Brexit and a People’s Vote where people can choose to remain in the European Union since the referendum was held. We will continue to fight for this in Parliament.”The chances of stopping Brexit and keeping the UK in the EU are the greatest they have been since the referendum, Nicola\u0026nbspSturgeon\u0026nbsphas claimed.The first minister spoke out the day after Holyrood\u0026nbspoverwhelmingly voted against both the PM\u0027s deal and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.Ms\u0026nbspSturgeon\u0026nbspsaid: I do oppose all and every kind of Brexit, I don\u0027t want Brexit to happen, I want Scotland and the whole of the UK to stay within the EU.She added: I do think there is a greater prospect of achieving that aim now than there has appeared to be at any time over the last two and a half years, which is why the SNP will do everything we can to bring that about.Tory MP Nicholas Soames - the great grandson of Winston Churchill, who voted to Remain - says the result of the referendum must be honoured.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe leaps praise on the PM for the achieving the deal and her resilience. If this deal is voted down, no other deal will miraculously appear, he says.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt\u0027s not a perfect deal and it was never going to be, he adds.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThis is from my colleague Rob Merrick, who was at this morning\u0027s Downing Street briefing for journalists:\u0026nbspThe prime minister’s spokeswoman provoked confusion about the extent of the new offer the PM\u0026nbspis willing to make to MPs, ahead of Tuesday’s vote.Earlier, Ms May confirmed she was exploring how to bolster “the role of parliament” in deciding, in June 2020, whether the UK should extend the post-Brexit transition – beyond December 2020 - or enter the Irish “backstop”.However, the spokeswoman said this did not stretch to seeking to reopen the withdrawal agreement, which the EU has also insisted is sealed and final.“We have been clear that the withdrawal agreement is final and agreed,” she said.It appears unlikely that many Brexiteers will be swayed by a stronger say in the 2020 decision, unless the agreement itself can be changed.Crucially, it says the decision will be taken jointly by a committee of the UK and the EU – despite the prime minister calling it “a choice” for Britain.Furthermore, as Philip Hammond, the chancellor, confirmed moments later, it will be the “default” to enter the backstop, at the end of the planned 21-month transition.It also appears that, even if the transition is extended, the UK would automatically enter the backstop no later than the end of 2022 – the limit for any extension.Asked about any new offer on the backstop, the spokeswoman said: “The prime minister is aware of the strength of feeling about this issue and is speaking to her colleagues to explain how parliament can have a greater say.”It is understood the government is also exploring other possible concessions, to try to head off a devastating defeat next Tuesday.Chancellor Philip Hammond is now opening the third day of debates on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. He says the deal offers a sensible compromise that protects the economy, but also delivers on the result of the referendum? This is the right way to go, he says.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHammond says at the beginning of the process there were those inside the EU who wanted to hand down a punishment deal for the UK.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThis deal is the best deal for leaving the EU that is available or going to be available.\u0026nbspThe alternatives to this deal are no deal or no Brexit, he says - echoing the prime minister\u0027s warning of the risk of voting down the deal next week.\u0026nbspThe chancellor also dismisses the idea that the Brexit deal can be renegotiated as delusional.\u0026nbspHe adds that the backstop remains as ultimate default, but says the option remains on the table of extending the implementation period.The EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has insisted that the agreement with the PM was the only deal on offer - as MPs gear up to vote on the deal in five days\u0027 time.In a speech at the European Committee of the Regions, he said: I must say once again, today, calmly and clearly: It is the only and the best possible agreement.He added that Brexit was a lose-lose situation and the deal was an exercise in damage limitation.Andrea Leadsom - the Commons leader - is now speaking at business questions. She reiterates her opposition to producing government legal advice to Parliament - after Number 10 was forced to publish its advice on Wednesday.\u0026nbspShe says she can confirm the meaningful vote will go ahead next week.Please allow a moment for the liveblog\u0026nbspto loadThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

A survey of parliamentary arithmetic currently shows it will be rejected by a large margin.One Brussels official told The Independent: “We hope they’re not going to try this because it’s the same as ripping up the withdrawal agreement.”EU’s top court to rule on Article 50 before next week’s vote on dealThroughout talks the EU and Irish government insisted that any border backstop would have to be “all-weather” and could not have a time-limit or other get-out clauses. The bloc’s negotiators spent months in negotiations ruling out various mechanisms to end it early.The purpose of the legal mechanism is to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland no matter what else happens in Brexit talks.\u0026nbspThe policy would keep the UK tied to the EU’s customs territory after it left and ramp up checks on some goods crossing the Irish sea. Both sides agree a hard border must not reappear because of the Good Friday agreement.Unionist critics say the backstop is a breach of UK sovereignty because there would be checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, while Tory MPs fear it could be used to tie Britain indefinitely to a customs union, which they do not want.May forced to call Varadkar to calm Irish anger over borderEU softens Northern Ireland border ‘backstop’ plan in bid to ease dealMichel Barnier urges Theresa May to reconsider Irish border planTheresa May’s Brexit plan ‘would lead to hard border’ with IrelandUnder the withdrawal agreement, if there is no other trade deal that would allow frictionless trade by 31 December 2020, both sides have agreed that the “backstop solution will apply until such a time as a subsequent agreement is in place”.But to avoid the backstop, the UK can instead request an extension of the transition period – which effectively keeps the UK following all EU rules as if it was still a member, without any say on them.This extension can only be for a maximum of two years, and would have to be agreed by a “joint committee” of the EU and UK – meaning the EU could have a veto. As such, the backstop would automatically come into force under the withdrawal agreement, unless the EU agrees to prolong the transition.This makes Theresa May’s suggestion of a parliamentary lock on the backstop either hollow – or in violation of the withdrawal agreement.Also speaking on Thursday, the\u0026nbspEU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier insisted the agreement was the only one\u0026nbspon offer.In a speech at the European Committee of the Regions, he said: “I must say once again, today, calmly and clearly: it is the only and the best possible agreement.”Created with Sketch.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread. Plenty more happened that would have been big news on any other day.\u0026nbspNigel Farage also announced he was leaving Ukip – the party he has long been synonymous with – because of its increasing closeness to far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\u0026nbspThe BBC dropped out of plans to host a debate on Brexit between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May after the three sides couldn’t agree on a format.The Pound fell to an 18-month low after the Government lost the contempt vote, but then rebounded.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King wrote an article in which he likened Theresa May’s Brexit deal to the appeasement of the Nazis. All in a day’s work!\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Nearly four years into the\u0026nbspcivil war, at least 10,000\u0026nbsphave been killed in the fighting and more than 22 million people rely on some sort of food assistance.Malnutrition and disease are now rampant as basic services have collapsed. As many as 85,000 children may have already died from hunger, according to Save the Children, and many more are at risk. Mr Griffiths said on Thursday that half of Yemen’s\u0026nbspnearly 30 million people could be at risk of famine if urgent action is not taken soon.Yemen war: Who are the Houthis and why is Saudi Arabia fighting them?Yemen’s war was sparked by the takeover of the capital Sanaa by Houthi forces in 2014. The following year, the Houthis took over much of the country and forced out the internationally recognised government of President Abdu-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, prompting a Saudi-led coalition of Gulf countries to intervene on Mr Hadi’s side. \u0026nbspThe fighting has created what is\u0026nbspdescribed as the world’s worst humanitarian disaster. Over the last five months, Yemen’s food crisis has been made significantly worse by fighting in\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspcity of Hodeidah. Some 80 per cent of the country’s food and medical supplies come through the port, but fighting has stopped much of it coming in. After an intense battle last month, clashes in the city\u0026nbsphas slowed and both sides have reinforced their positions.The UN hopes the negotiations in Sweden can prevent a\u0026nbspfull-scale assault on the city, and reopen the airport in the capital Sanaa\u0026nbsp– where access is restricted by Saudi control of Yemeni airspace.\u0026nbspThe beginning of the talks coincided with the release of a World Food Programme survey which found that 15 million people are in a “crisis” or “emergency” situation and that number could hit 20 million without sustained food aid. The report also discovered that some\u0026nbsp65,000 people were experiencing “catastrophic” food conditions, mostly in areas where fighting is taking place. That number could rise to more than 230,000, it added.Johan Mooij, Yemen country director for CARE International, said the report should be a “wake-up call for the world”.He said: “Without humanitarian assistance here in Yemen, almost a quarter of a million people would immediately be in famine, and a staggering 20 million people would not have enough to eat – all because of a manmade crisis. The tragedy here grows worse by the day, stretching the limits of what CARE and other humanitarian groups can do to alleviate misery and prevent more deaths.”The WFP\u0026nbspsaid it is planning to scale up food distribution to another four million people over the next two months, increasing the number of people it supports to 12 million.Created with Sketch.Brutal effects of Yemeni war  Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Yemen organised by the UAE\u0027s National Media Council shows a Yemeni woman holding a child diagnosed with malnutrition at a hospital in the southeastern port city of Mukalla, the capital Hadramawt provinceMohamed, 2, is treated for Malnutrition in Mukalla, the capital Hadramawt province, Yemena trip in Yemen organised by the UAE\u0027s National Media Council (NMC) shows a Yemeni woman holding a child diagnosed with malnutrition at a hospital in the southeastern port city of Mukalla, the capital Hadramawt province.

Few are optimistic that these talks will produce a comprehensive agreement, but UN diplomats hope a series of confidence-building measures will open the way to further negotiations.On Thursday, Mr Griffiths confirmed:\u0026nbsp“I’m also pleased to announce the signing of an agreement on the exchange of prisoners, detainees, the missing, the forcibly detained and iniduals placed under house arrest. It will allow thousands of families to be reunited, and it is the product of very effective, active work from both delegations.”\u0026nbspPressure on Saudi mounts as Turkey, US senators and UN turn up heatWhether a broader deal on the conflict can be agreed remains\u0026nbspto be seen.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004530656212.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says goodbye george bush","story":"Alongside Western allies, none more important than the British, he helped to steer the world through the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the birth of young democracies across Eastern Europe.And he led an international coalition to victory in the first Gulf War, after Margaret Thatcher told him it was “no time to go wobbly” and that their shared values were worth fighting for.He was part of a group of world leaders who had the courage of their convictions and a belief in freedom and liberty, both economic and social.The tributes paid to the President from those who worked with him in new, emerging nations show how important that faith was.Politicians today could learn from his steadfast commitment.History will remember him fondly. WE couldn’t agree more with Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman.Our schools cannot become surrogate parents. They are there to teach — not to solve the obesity crisis, toilet-train kids or take knives out of teenagers’ hands.There is a growing trend in our politics and our society to take away responsibility from iniduals.Everything from the ludicrous sugar tax to banning speakers from universitiesthey dare to contradict the snowflake agenda all flow from this sinister belief that we can’t be trusted to look after ourselves or make sensible decisions.Schools being used as a catch-up service is a symptom of a culture where too often we’re told that somebody  will do it for us.More people like Ms Spielman must come out and say enough is enough.We must put personal responsibility back at the centre of all our lives. SPEEDBOAT killer Jack Shepherd is treating our justice system with contempt. It is staggering we’re paying for it through Legal Aid.Politicians continually pay lip service to making changes to the legal aid system, but case after jaw-dropping case continues to come into the public eye.It’s important that everybody has access to justice, and financial support is a key part of that. But it cannot be abused.And it’s hard to imagine a more blatant case of that than dishing it out to a coward who refuses to answer for his crimes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And because it keeps us in a customs union preventing us enacting our own trade deals.Despite the persuasive efforts of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox yesterday, we just don’t believe the EU will seek to avoid the backstop — or let us leave it.It will do anything to prevent an independent free-trading powerhouse on its doorstep. And once we’ve paid our £billion “bill” our leverage is gone.Why did our negotiators not demand a way to exit this trap  Because they didn’t think Brussels would agree. Such has been the feebleness of our efforts since David Cameron first had a go.Mrs May is now reduced to claiming we CAN do our own trade deals before the backstop kicks in. And yes, we can sign them . . . but they may never come into effect.The PM should not waste a week trying to sell this bad deal to the public.She shouldto Brussels and tell them it won’t work.GIVEN how many terror attacks MI has helped foil in Europe, you’d think Brussels would want the UK’s security and military might onside.Instead, out of spite, they are freezing us out of the Galileo satellite project we have invested £.billion in.Theresa May still insists we “will remain committed to Europe’s collective security” after Brexit.Pity the Brussels pygmies can’t say the same.IMAGINE the outragea Tory MP abused and threatened areporter with a savage beating for asking questions.That politician would be toast.Yet somehow Corbynista Kate Osamor is still a Labour MP.She employed her son in Parliament despite his serious drugs conviction, then lied about when she knew of it.When a Times reporter challenged her she swore at him, threatened to beat him with a bat and threw a bucket of water over him.She’s even banned from editing Wikipedia for doctoring her own entry.For now, she’s off Corbyn’s front bench.

Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Christmas Day I will be enduringour annual family fallout over a game of Monopoly. ButI wasn’t, I’d be straight round to Middleton Towers in Bucklebury, Berks, for what sounds like an idyllically festive few days.In a Christmas walnutshell, it goes something like this: Wake up whenever, pop in to the local church, go for a walk, open a few pressies, smoked salmon and champagne for lunch, more pressies, some games, then the main meal early evening.Oh, and all the grandchildren will have a small tree in their bedrooms that they can decorate themselves. The rest of the year, she says, “is really normal most of the time”. Which, to Prince William, who has grown up amid the pomp and circumstance of stuffy royal traditions, must feel like a slice of sheer heaven.Instead, poor love, he and Kate are expected to join the rest of the royalsat Sandringham, where the Queen et al stick to the German tradition of opening gts on Christmas Eve before dressing for a “formal dinner” from which, oh dear, the women eventually retire to another room while the men enjoy a port or brandy.Then it’s off to the highly publicised visit to St Mary’s Magdalene church on Christmas morning, followed by a turkey lunch and a communal viewing of “Granny’s” speech at pm.It’s unclear when William and Kate will head off to see her family, but what’s the betting they get in the car with fixed grins before mumbling “thank God that’s over for another year” the second they hit Norfolk’s A  And that’s why, whatever the truth behind the rumours that Kate and Meghan aren’t getting on, it won’t matter one jot to the admirably grounded Duchess of Cambridge who, thanks to her idyllic childhood, knows exactly who she is.Meghan, on the other hand, has no such cosy alternative to retreat to. Her parents orced when she was just six years old and it’s no secret that she’s now estranged from her father Thomas and his highly vocal, deliciously off-message side of the family.So, however well meaning she is, all her charitable grandstanding and repeated declarations of being “an independent woman” suggest she finds validation from being regarded as a, yawn, groundbreaking feminist role model rather than, as Kate is dismissed by some, a dutul we and mother, who toes the royal line and doesn’t make waves.But Kate has no need to virtue signal because she’s rooted in the love and respect of her tight-knit family — a set-up she’s replicating with William, who, after his own fractured childhood, clearly adores the normality of le Chez Middleton.And of course, they’re both equally secure in the knowledge that, post-“King Charles”, the top job is theirs.Harry, on the other hand, has chosen a bride who, despite her efforts at reinvention, has a chequered pastand a burning desire to be seen as more than just a pretty appendage to the sixth-in-line to the throne.That’s understandable.

Suddenly, every berk thinks that the phone in their hand gives them the right to publish anything they see.Either they have some gung-ho fantasy of being a war correspondent, responsible for recording a fracas without doing a damn thing about stopping it. Or  in their head they are suddenly Quentin ­Tarantino, recording a particularly tasty bit of violence.So we get incidents like last week’s, at a Towie-favourite nightclub in Gants Hill, North East ­London. A young woman was filmed being sexually assaulted as onlookers, some of them women, jeer at the “fun” and point cameras up her skirt.Were these people scared of intervening and pulling the thugs off her, and filming it in order to pass the footage on to club management and police  Nope, they just put it up on the internet for the world to share the jeering. The weird and wicked idea that this is somehow OK is growing.Incidents on planes, in clubs, in the street, in schoolyards, are filmed by bystanders who don’t even try to shout or intervene. They are then plonked online, just to get some strange kudos for the person filming it.From the US and, increasingly, here there are cases of onlookers recording the humiliation of other people, not responsibly and ethically in order to give it to the authorities — managements, police, teachers — but just to put it online and “go viral”.Take the coward who last month filmed a policewoman being violently kicked in the head, then posted the footage online with the caption “LOL.” Or the bully who posted a video of a drunk teen ­giving oral sex to more than  men in Magaluf, for the “banter”.And last week, a shocking video of a -year-old Syrian refugee boy called Jamal being dragged to the floor by his neck went viral. Then, because the poor boy has not been humiliated enough, his ordeal was shared online by “disgusted” celebs and MPs who proclaim to care but are, of course, unwittingly ­contributing to his suffering.Some may vaguely think they are activists exposing bad ­behaviour, but in cases like this they are no such thing. They are voyeurs, cowards, and exhibitionists. Because it’s the victim of the attack, not just the attackers, who gets humiliated.Anyone half-decent understands that only disgusting ­people go in for “revenge porn”, sharing intimate videos of someone they broke up with. Whether dumped or cheated on, that is a horrible thing to do and can make the victim suicidal. Young girls live in terror of it, on one hand encouraged to be sexy and on the other scared of having their most unguarded moments exposed to the world.It has, a few times, led to ­prosecution and so it should. But personal vengeance and associated “slut-shaming” is only part of it.The whole business of filming other people without consent needs to be seen for what it is — a form of unregulated, potentially irresponsible and damaging rogue journalism.  Smartphone tech and the internet should be ­governed by the same ethical rules journalism developed.Good editors pixelate faces and agonise about what is responsible reporting, and what is in the ­public interest.If it would be wrong for a news reporter to film, for no good ­reason, a person being humiliated, assaulted, or even just tumbling in the street or falling asleep in an embarrassing position on a train, then it is even more wrong for any selfish git with a smartphone to do it.Journalism has rules because it is public. Now that technology can make anyone’s instant shot just as public, the rules should be the same. And because the technology belongs to the “digital natives” who grew up with it, it is time they applied to it all those pious, ethical modern values which we hear so much about.Not all slut-shamers and gloating video bystanders are young — but a great many are.

The people had been given a voice.And the people said very clearly: We want to leave.But there was never a majority among our political class for leaving.tp composite more brexitBecause for two years the Remainer majority of MPs has done everything it possibly can to thwart the will of the people.They have undermined Theresa May and the Government when it tried to negotiate with Brussels.That’s the main reason the deal we have before us now is so weak.Because as soon as ministers set off to do battle, the likes of Philip Hammond and Justine Greening would be trying to pull the rug from under their feet.The biggest deceit is this. All the while these politicians are trying to scupper Brexit, they are putting on their sincere faces and saying: “We must respect the will of the people.”This is a downright lie and it has always been a downright lie.When Tory Remainers tell you we must get a good deal, they really mean we must not leave the European Union.When the Labour Party tells you that we must have a “good Brexit for jobs”, they really mean that we must not leave the European Union.When that coffin-faced bore Dominic Grieve, once our Attorney General, puts down amendments which effectively stop us leaving with a no-deal, he is really saying: “We must not leave the European Union under any conditions at all.”When they start lecturing you about how Parliament must be sovereign — they’re saying the same thing. We must not leave the EU.What has happened over the past two years has been a concerted campaign of treachery and betrayal.The Tory Brexiteers — with one or two exceptions, such as David Davis, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg — haven’t helped by being a disorganised rabble.Too interested in their own political careers to do the dficult work of leading Britain towards a confident exit from that authoritarian bureaucracy.But it is the Remainers who have done the real damage.If they didn’t tell us, at every step of the way, that “the people’s vote must be respected” then I’d have a little more time for them. But they trot that out every time they open their mouths.All the while trying to wreck any chance of Brexit.God knows what will happen now. Although I suspect even he’s perplexed.What should have been a graceful and confident exit from an unfit institution has turned into a bugger’s muddle.But I do know this. The people of the UK will not forget the names of those who have sold us down the river.And one day, sure enough, we’ll have our revenge.What’s advertised as a glistening winter wonderland is usually five square yards of mud with a plastic donkey and an elf who has just completed a five stretch for armed robbery.I know everybody needs to make a ­living. But I do wonder how the owners of these crap grottos live with themselves.Find eight of the best Winter Wonderlands here.WHAT a fabulous family the Osamors are.A real credit to the country, to the Labour Party and to the House of Commons.Let’s start with Kate, above, the Labour MP for Edmonton and one of Jeremy ­Corbyn’s favourites.She employed her son, Ishmael, below, as a researcher at the House of Commons.And continued to do so even after he had been convicted of possessing lethal drugs including ketamine and ecstasy at a festival.Not only that, but she misled the public and her colleagues.She said she hadn’t known about her son’s conviction until after he was sentenced.When it was absolutely clear that she had.How did she respond when a journalist tried to ask her about this business She screamed “f*** off” at him. Then threw a bucket of water at him.Then said: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your head in.”After which, this entitled madam actually rang  – twice – to say the reporter was “stalking” her.Unbelievable.Then there’s  Grandma Osamor, Kate’s mother Martha. Now ennobled as Baroness Osamor of Tottenham and taking her seat in the House of Lords at your expense.A supporter of Labour activists suspended over anti-Semitism.And once considered too left-wing even for the Labour Party, until Corbyn came along.What a great parenting job both she and her daughter have done.And do you suppose that either would be in the ­positions they are now were it not for the colour of their skin THE animal rights activists Peta want us to stop using  certain phrases which are nasty about animals.Such as, “No use flogging a dead horse”.Better to say: “You can’t feed a fed horse.” Which doesn’t sound right at all, to me.Some vegans are also supposedly  objecting to “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, because it’s unkind to eggs. And “bringing home the bacon”. Which is unkind to bacon.I think we need to create a few new ones to annoy Peta even further. So . . .Too many voles in the blender spoil the smoothie.Riots, confusion, mayhem. They’ve just woken up to the fact that their president is a smirking liberal halfwit who cares not a jot about working-class people.  We could have told you that, mes amis, when you elected him  months ago.Emmanuel Macron has already had to climb down and give in to some of the demands from the rioters.During the election he portrayed himself as a populist, but was anything but. It was a con job.Next time you toddle off to the polls, you lot, get it right.SO, Nigel Farage has deserted Ukip because he thinks the party has become too extremist.Fair enough, he’s probably right. The party looks dead and buried.It’s a shame that because of our first-past-the-post system Ukip were never able to capture many seats in parliament.I’ve never been a fan of proportional representation.Butwe had it, Ukip under Farage, above, would likely be our second or third biggest party by now.And those negotiations over  Brexit would be looking very dferent, wouldn’t they RESPECT to Wrexham driver Kenneth Samuels. He managed to fit ELEVEN people into his Ford Focus.Actually, he’s a Wrexham non-driver now, because the Old Bill caught him.  He was disqualied from driving for  months.I assumed at first that he was ferrying a troupe of dwarves to a panto.But no. There were children involved, which kind of antagonised the magistrates.If the police had looked a bit further I suspect they’d have found the entire Liberal Democrat Party in the boot.  And Speaker John Bercow in the glove box. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Lloyd said in a statement: It is with great regret that I am today resigning the Liberal Democrat Party Whip in Parliament. I have come to the conclusion that I cannot honestly uphold the commitment I made to Eastbourne and Willingdon two-and-a-half years ago, and reiterated since - to accept the result of the referendum, vote for the deal the Prime Minister brought back from the EU and not back calls for a second referendum - whilst supporting the Lib Dem Parliamentary Partys formal position of voting against Theresa Mays deal and advocating a Peoples Vote.

Although I have resigned the whip, I continue to be a member of the Liberal Democrats, have nothing but respect and affection for the party leader, Sir Vince Cable MP, my Parliamentary colleagues and the Lib Dems. I will not cease fighting hard for liberal values, both locally and nationally. Locally, I will continue to work hand in hand with our excellent Liberal Democrat council, ensuring the best for our town and campaigning for us to retain control at the local elections next May. I also want to reassure the residents of Eastbourne  Willingdon Ill continue to press the issues that they come to me for help with in Parliament, and beyond, as ferociously as I have always done.   When it comes to representing my constituency, todays announcement changes nothing. People can continue to come and see me, email and write to me or pop along to one of my regular community surgeries. Folk have always known that I put our town before party politics. That was the case yesterday, it is today, it will be tomorrow, and will remain for as long as I have the privilege of representing Eastbourne in Parliament. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: We respect what we know was a dficult decision forStephenahead of next weeks vote and are sorry to see him go. Liberal Democrats are clear that we will be voting against Theresa Mays deal. The Liberal Democrats have campaigned for an exit from Brexit and a Peoples Vote where people can choose to remain in the European Union since the referendum was held. We will continue to fight for this in Parliament.

Faggot is an old Irish slang word for a lazy person or a waster, and thats the meaning that Shane McGowan intended when he wrote the song. Nothing to do with homophobia.

Shopping for gts and food, decorating the home and even deciding what to wear to festive parties will see a total of  hours taken up with plans for the big day. Just over eight hours is spent shopping and wrapping presents while another  hours and  minutes is taken up with deciding what to wear to Christmas parties. Almost four hours will go on writing and sending Christmas cards while five hours and  minutes will go on the Christmas dinner.   It also emerged a quarter of Brits start thinking about Christmas as early as the first week in October, in order to get everything done on time. A spokesperson for Next, which commissioned the research, said: “For many, planning for Christmas is something they approach like a military operation. “But while you may not think it takes up a lot of your time with the little tasks here and there, it really does add up over the weeks leading up to Christmas. “It seems we’re a nation of planners, who won’t be satisfied until there’s a completed to-do list come the end of Christmas Eve, which is why our online Christmas shop comes complete with gt guides and search inspiration to make your shopping that bit easier.   “Evenwe’re not the best planners in day-to-day le, when the festive season rolls around even the most disorganised person ups their game to make sure the big day goes smoothly.” The study, of , adults, found one in eight Brits will buy their first gt by September st, while the majority will get their turkey ordered by December th at the latest. And a third of Brits have their Christmas tree and decorations up by December st But while a third of Brits would describe themselves as organised in their normal le,  per cent admit to making an effort to be more prepared around Christmas. It also emerged that on average, Brits find planning Christmas exactly  per cent ‘stressful’ – with the remaining  per cent deemed generally enjoyable.   Although more than half admit to feeling ‘overwhelmed’ by how much they need to do for a magical Christmas. Even with all the planning in the world, it’s inevitable that something will fall through the cracks with  per cent of Brits admitting they will forget to send Christmas cards. Four in  won’t remember to pick up batteries to power new toys, and a fth will settle down to wrap some presents – only to find they’ve forgotten to buy the wrapping paper. One in  have even, at some point, forgotten to put their turkey in the oven on Christmas morning – leading to agonising delays for the main meal.As a result, four in  of those polled, via OnePoll , have had to hunt around to find an open shop on Christmas Day itself to recty the fact they’ve forgotten some vital element.

An urban explorer says he looked around the empty mansion and claims to have found animal bones hanging from the ceiling. Tony Martin, a farmer from Norfolk, was convicted of murder in August  after shooting burglar Fred Barras, , dead in his home. He later had his sentence reduced to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. His former mansion and farm outbuildings, which stand together on a plot of land in Emneth Hungate, Norfolk, appear to have remained empty for many years.   The -year-old now lives at a dferent secret address. The clip follows YouTuber Abandoned World Explorer UK as he makes his way around the eerie house whilst on holiday with a few friends in June.His video gives a tour around the property showing the house covered in overgrown plants and grass. Walking around the abandoned house, the explorer stumble across piles of unidentied bones lying around in the bathroom. As they continue upstairs, they discover a room with animal bones hanging from the ceiling on pieces of string.   Its not clear how the bones got on the pieces of string but there were another pile of bones on the floor beneath them.Footage shows how cars were left to rot in a damp garage and other farm vehicles are left abandoned in high grass. The explorer said: We spotted the house whilst on holiday and decided to explore it without realising whose house it was. The bones around the place made the house seem like it was something out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  They were hung up like decorations and looking like a spider web. I dont think I will be going back, I felt so intimidated and scared whist we were there. To me the most interesting thing I saw was the classic MK Range Rover in the garage and the hanging bones. I film abandoned places all the time and realised this one seemed a little odd.   Before the killing, Martin had complained the the police had not done enough after he had been burgled at least  times. At least pound, worth of furniture had been stolen, he claimed.Fred Barras and Brendan Fearon were armed with a baseball bat and a chisel when they broke into his home on August , . Martin blasted them three times with an illegal pump action shot gun.   Both fled through a window but Barras died on the grounds of the now abandoned mansion. In , Martin had his sentence reduced on appeal and was released in . The case sparked a national debate about whether or not he had used excessive force while protecting his home.

The absent-minded man apparently mistook the scattered leaves in the canal for a footpath and simply fell in. The footage was captured on CCTV outside a Nottingham pub at around .am on November . Annmarie Gardener, landlady of the of the The Navigation Inn, said her camera caught the moment a man on his mobile phone fell into the canal at the back of her pub and how two people came to his rescue and pull him out. Now the wants to alert people of the dangers of walking close to the canal while distracted. She told the Nottingham Post: It is not usually a problem - most people know it is a canal. When you watch it he thought because the leaves were on it the canal disappeared and became a path.  He was on his phone. We do put warnings out in the pub and tell people to be careful. I think we have had one other person who slipped on the edge but he came back out. When the leaves are in there it can be dangerous. It does worry me and we would like to warn others. It is also deep. The Canal and River Trust is warning people to be aware of the dangers lurking around canals during the Christmas period.  A spokesman said: We’re obviously pleased that this incident had a happy,soggy, ending, but it could have been a lot more serious and we’d definitely urge people to keep their wits about them when they’re on the towpath. While this kind of incident is unusual we are this week supporting the Don’t Drink and Drown campaign which encourages people to stay safe during the Christmas party season.  Our advice at this time of year is to definitely pay a visit to your local canal or river as they’re great places to stay fit, de-stressand relax, but to take extra care. Towpaths can be wet or icy increasing the risk of slipping, tripping or falling into freezing water so stay away from the edge and be careful where you tread. Di Steer, CEO of the Royal Le Saving Society UK, said: People tragically die each year because they’ve entered the water with alcohol in their bloodstream, either deliberately or completely by accident.  Drinking near or in water can be a dangerous and deadly cocktail. Alcohol can seriously impede your ability to survive in water. When walking home from a night out, avoid routes that are alongside water, particularly in the darkness, and always stay with and look out for your friends.

But fortunately, the surgery was a success.Little Alexander and Harris managed to reach  weeks and, despite being born prematurely just five days later, are now adorable tots. Their parents, from Surrey, have shared their story ahead of World TTTSAwareness Day tomorrow.They are warning parents of identical twins not to be afraid to challenge the care being giventhey suspect the le-threatening condition.“Dont be afraid to speak up about the care, especiallyit falls below the standards set out by NICE and Tamba, said Duncan, referring to the UK charity, Twins And Multiple Births Association.And dont feel afraid to seek support from other parents who have been through TTTS. We feel very lucky to have received the care that we did.Angelina was  weeks pregnant when she was diagnosed with Stage  TTTS, which affects the flow of blood from the placenta to each baby. The condition means one twin - the recipient - receives too much blood, with the higher blood volume putting a strain on their heart. Meanwhile, the other twin - the donor - receives too little blood. This baby often becomes smaller and anaemic - and can suffer from a reduced amount of amniotic fluid, according to Tamba.The condition is potentially fatal, leaving both babies at risk.Angelina was monitored and she and Duncan enjoyed some normality - but by  weeks, the TTTS was found to have progressed. It was just hours before this scan, while driving, that the concerned mum-to-be had felt something wrong with her bump. She recalled: “It felt swollen and hard but also uneven making me almost hunch over which looking back was obviously the result of one of the twins having too much fluid around him. “My advice to all expectant twin mums is to keep an eye on your bump and get these things checked. We were lucky we had a scan the next morning,we didn’t it could have been a very dferent outcome.” The scan revealed one twin had no visible bladder and was stuck due to having no fluid around him, while the other had an enlarged heart due to the strain of the additional fluid.  The couple were told that without surgery they would lose both boys. And even after the procedure, they could still lose them.“I was absolutely devastated and terried. I felt a failure as a mother because my body wasn’t protecting them like it should,” said Angelina. “We’d read all the statistics about survival rates and felt so scared and nervous for the future of our unborn children. “But then reading all the information on the Tamba website really helped us and helped me stay away from the general Internet too much.” The surgery, carried out by Dr Asma Khalil at St Georges, went well. However, the worried couple were repeatedly warned that the twin left with a small placenta share may not make it. They lived in constant fear at each follow-up scan. Not long after, they celebrated reaching  weeks, knowing that one of the twins was now more than lb and the chance of survival was increasing day by day. But just five days later, Alexander and Harris arrived into the world via emergency C-section as Angelina suffered a placenta abruption and lost more than a litre of blood. The boys were in hospital for  days in total. They came out at what would have been  weeks gestation.  Duncan said: “We had many ups and downs during our stay including Alex getting very poorly with e-coli and needing ROP surgery, as well as many transfusions and Alex on and off oxygen.“Our care was split between St Peter’s in Chertsey, which we were lucky is the highest level neonatal intensive care unit in Surrey, and St George’s in London where the surgery took place. “The best thing St Peters did was to know where their knowledge finished and when it was right for us to referred to the specialists at St Georges. “This was NHS care at its best as consultants at both hospitals were amazing at treating the boys and at ensuring we were both OK and took the time to answer the many questions we both had. But he claimed: We know this isn’t always the case which is why Tamba’s research and QI programmes are so important. What is TTTS Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndromeis a rare condition that occurs in about  to  per cent of identical twin pregnancies. If left untreated,  per cent of these babies will die, Tamba says. And even with treatment, there is only up to a  per cent chance of both babies surviving.Of those that do survive, there is a chance they will suffer from a disability or health condition. Tamba says: TTTS occurs when there is an imbalance of blood supply from the placenta to the twin babies.One baby receives less bloodand often becomes smaller and anaemic. They can also suffer from a reduced amount of amniotic fluid and become stuck to the side of the womb.The twin who receives more bloodbecomes bigger and the higher blood volume puts a strain on their heart. The charity adds: A common way to help treat TTTS is laser ablation.This is where a camera and laser are inserted into the womb and some of the shared blood vessels are coagulated using the laser. After this surgery, excess amniotic fluid in the recipient twin’s sac is also removed to achieve a normal volume. Only a handful of clinicians across the UK are able to perform laser ablation surgery on twins as it is a highly specialised procedure.

The little royal was caught short while the family were driving in a black Range Rover through south London. So, just as pretty much every parent has done at some point, the Duchess of Cambridge found herself on the lookout for the nearest bathroom. They walked into the Phoenix pub in Stockwell hand in hand and spent just less than ten minutes using the facilities. Maggie McKinney, a regular at the pub, told MailOnline: I was sitting in my usual chair and when I looked up I saw Kate Middleton, I mean the Duchess of Cambridge and her daughter Princess Charlotte.  The little kiddie just trotted in with her mum, went to the toilet and then trotted out. They could not have been in the pub for more than ten minutes. They seem very nice, totally normal. Princess Kate was holding her daughters hand. Princess Charlotte was just any other little girl. Before Kate and Charlotte entered the pub a plain clothed woman, believed to be a protection officer, walked in and asked bar staffa little girl would use the bathroom.  Charlotte was wearing a blue skirt, a white blouse, a light-blue coat and white tights. Her mum Kate looked casual in blue culottes and a navy top. Yesterday the Duchess gave well-wishers an update on Prince Louis during a flying visit to an RAF base in Cyprus. When she was outside the Warrant Officers and Sergeants’ Mess, Kate chatted to Rhian Davis, , who was carrying -week-old daughter Dorothy in a sling. Rhian said: She asked whether she was sleeping through the night and she told me that Louis is starting to wave.

Molly Phillips, , went to hospital for a suspected stroke but later realised she been strangled by the bars chef at their annual bash. Miss Phillips said she passed out after chef Nathan Webb gripped her neck at the Cameo Clubs festive party, which was held at the bar in Roath, Cardf on New Years Day. Footage from CCTV shown at an employment tribunal hearing captured the moment Mr Webb put his arm around her neck and strangled her, reports Wales Online.  The video, which Judge Alison Frazer refers to in her judgement, shows Mollys arms go rigid as the chef holds her neck and when he releases her, she collapses to the floor hitting her head. The employment tribunal ruled Ms Phillips was unfairly dismissed when bosses failed to properly investigate her complaint that she was strangled at the party. Molly told the tribunal she had since learned that her facial paralysis is more permanent than first thought and she may never be able to smile again. She said she was told her injuries were “were either caused by lack of oxygen or nerve damage”. The tribunal heard that Mr Webb was arrested over the incident but was released under investigation and remained employed by the Cameo Club after the incident.   Molly initially ed to work after the incident and told bosses she did not want to take any action. But as time went on, she became increasingly distrustful and fearful of the chef. Medics also told her that the injuries she suffered would have longer lasting effects than previously thought. Yet when she raised these concerns with the directors of the company, she was told to get over it and ultimately felt she had no choice but to quit.  In her judgement following the tribunal, judge Alison Frazer was heavily critical of the Cameos directors for failing to take her concerns seriously. She said: The fact was the CCTV evidence showed that Mr Webb had her in a hold which caused her to fall to the floor. It was only open to the Respondent to take a view as to what action was appropriate after it had impartially gathered the facts via an investigation. I find that from April onwards Mr Davies acted in a way which was dismissive of the Claimant’s feelings about the incident. He told her to ‘get over it’ when referring to the Christmas party incident. Since the incident, Molly says that as well as her partial facial paralysis, she suffers from PTSD, anxiety and depression. I can’t smile in photographs, she said.  People don’t notice it, but I notice it more than anything. If it’s still like that when I get married, I won’t be able to smile in my wedding photos. Things like that. It’s not nice. But for Molly, the worst bit was the fact her bosses didnt do anything. I’d worked there for two and half years and done everything to that place and it was just like, I realised I meant nothing to them and I was completely disposable, she said. In her evidence at the employment tribunal at Cardf Magistrates Court, Molly said she felt asthe directors didnt take her seriously. When she told director Jason Pearce, she claimed he responded by joking with Mr Webb as he walked past, telling him something along the lines of: “All right buddy  Hear you’ve been choking girls lately’. “I was never askedI was comfortable, how my medical condition was, nothing,” she said. Molly told the hearing that she found working at the establishment increasingly dficult as time went on.   She told the hearing that other alleged behaviour by Mr Webb included putting chilli in a staff member’s soup and threatening someone on a night out. After these incidents, she told her employers she had begun lose faith in their ability “to keep her safe in her workplace”. By March  she said she was “finding it hard to come into work and was crying both before and during my shts”. She told the tribunal: “Around the end of March I was in tears to Huw telling him that I just didn’t feel comfortable in work anymore but I was given the same response over and over, that he couldn’t ‘wave a magic wand and fix everything’. “Meeting after meeting I was just getting that same response and nothing more.” She also claimed she was told in one meeting on April  by Mr Davies to just “get over it, and the same comment was made again on April . In her written judgement, Judge Frazer criticised the directors for not fully investigating at this stage.   Judge Frazer wrote: She was able to carry on at work without suffering any real psychological effects, working alongside Mr Webb, until March. In March the Claimant observed two incidents that made her perceive the Christmas party incident in a dferent way. Rightly or wrongly, she formed the view from these incidents that he had the capacity to be violent towards women. This made her believe that she had been the victim of insidious violence at the hands of Mr Webb. Around this time, she also learnt that her facial paralysis was more permanent than initially anticipated. I find that this culminated in her feeling vulnerable around Mr Webb in the workplace. In my finding there was an inextricable link between the incident at the Christmas party and the workplace, even though it had happened off duty. It was a works Christmas party held on site. She also criticised the directors for their response to the CCTV footage.   She said: Mr Pearce understood from observation of the CCTV that the Claimant had been strangled. Mr Davies, on the other hand, denied that this was the case. Mr Pearce did not watch the video until April or May and Mr Davies only watched it once. And she concluded that because of their actions - and the actions of another person brought in to hear a grievance that Molly raised - Molly was justied in resigning. Judge Frazer concluded: [Molly] was constructively unfairly dismissed. Molly said she had a sense of relief when she found out she had won. It just feels like a weight lted, she added. I don’t want to think about it anymore. Cameo Club said it had no comment at all. Speaking after the hearing, a spokeswoman for South Wales Police said: A -year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and he is currently released under investigation.

Bosses at Thistles in Stirling, Scotland, flatly declined a request for the traditional display saying customers did not want to be subjected to inidual organisations beliefs. Even when an MP urged them to reconsider the ban, the shopping centre refused to budge on its decision.Now critics of the centre have accused them of double standards by promoting a Christmas Market this year. And the Scottish Catholic Church has urged Thistles to abandon its Grinch-like stance and reconsider.  The Church of Scotland claimed it was a sad day for all of us. Members of the Catholic Legion of St Marys Association, took to Facebook to complain about the ban, under the heading: Bring back the nativity scene to the Thistles, Stirling. It stated: Their reason being that despite heavily promoting Christmas for commercial gain, they pride themselves on religious neutrality and so wont allow a nativity to be present any longer. While I understand that no one wants religious or political evangelists in a shopping centre, the request was simply to have a nativity, which would be manned and anyone approaching could ask about it. A member of the association, Margaret Patterson, complained to her local MP, Stephen Kerr, who wrote to Thistles asking them to reconsider.  They replied: Thistles shopping centre prides itself on being religiously and politically neutral in its behaviour within the local community and with this in mind we do not feel it would be right to agree to host this type of promotion within a shopping centre. Our customers come to enjoy a leisure activity without being subjected to inidual organisations beliefs. We will not be willing to reconsider the application any further and hope that this final decision is accepted. Critics of the centre are aggrieved that managers are happy to feature Christmas itself as part of the retail experience. In a press release sent out on November , Centre Director of Thistles, Gary Turnbull said: This years Christmas at Thistles promises to be extra special. The Christmas Market will be a fantastic new addition to this years retail experience. A spokesman for the catholic Archdiocese of St Andrews  Edinburgh said: At this time of year Christmas cribs grace many public squares all across the British Isles, bringing joy to nearly all who encounter them, regardless of their religion.  It seems just a wee bit, well, Grinch-like for the Thistles Shopping Centre to ban the Christmas crib and, in the true spirit of Christmas, we would certainly ask them to reconsider their decision. A spokeswoman from the Church of Scotland added: We find it very disappointing that the true meaning of Christmas has been completely lost here. When a shopping centre can focus purely on commercialism to the exclusion of the reason for the celebration of Christmas it is a sad day for all of us. MP Mr Kerr said: I am disappointed that a rather rigid view seems to have been taken regarding the existing policy. Surely there is room for a simple display that may be of interest to people. I would hope that an application from any faith group would be considered on its own merits. A spokeswoman from the Thistles Centre said: While we are sympathetic with Legion of St Marys request to have a nativity scene in Thistles Shopping Centre, we are unfortunately unable to accommodate it. As is common amongst shopping centres, our policy is to support our local community in celebrating the festive season without affiliating with any specic religions or beliefs.

Stacey Booth, , suffered a horric campaign abuse from Alexander Heavens, also , who she had been with for seven years. Booth is now speaking out about her ordeal after Heavens pleaded guilty to engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour in an intimate relationship. Convinced she would die from his relentless abuse, Stacey, of Blackley in Greater Manchester, made secret recordings of his behaviour for her family to find in the event of her death. Manchester Crown court heard Heavens on one occasion punched her twice to the face. Prosecutor Rob Smith added: During arguments, he began bending her fingers back so far that she thought they were going to break. On one occasion she was going to sleep when he asked her a question about something on her phone, and when he didnt get a reply he punched her in the face. She remembers being pushed to the kitchen floor, stood on and trampled on. When she was asleep he would grab her finger and use it to unlock her phone as it had her fingerprint ID code.  Exhausted Stacey says she felt numb and ran on nothing, dramatically losing weight and waiting for birdsong at the end of each night to let her know she could escape to go to work. She says she became so convinced she would end up dead that she started making secret recordings of Heavens nightly activity and sending them to herself to let her family know what had happened. Heavens will face sentencing next May. Now bravely speaking out about her ordeal, Stacey hopes that her terrying story will inspire others to get out of abusive and controlling relationships. Stacey said: You think its going to be your happy ever after story. You get engaged and think youre going to get married but then reality set in and it just got worse and worse and worse.  I feel like having that ring and being engaged gave him more control over me. I had a voice at the beginning. But the more he did to me the more my voice just went away. I used to record him towards the end because I felt like no one would believe me. Thats what helped me get him into the courtroom. I used to put my phone face down and as he drted off to sleep Id put my camera on because I knew hed start. My phone would record the whole night. I would wake up and he would be trying to get on my phone and he would be that drugged up and drunk that he would be recording me sleeping. He would be saying put your password in your phone, put it in your phone. He would check through all my social media, all my work friends who I work with. He used to check through everything. The last year, I felt like someone I worked with would [end up] working on my body. It just felt like a matter of time. It got to the point where I thought I would go home and no one knew anything about it, anything about me or what I was going through. I actually sat there in work and thought this could be my family sat at this table, this could be my mum, my dad, my brothers, sat at this table talking about me because of what hes done.  Nobody would know my story and I would have no voice. I think thats why I started to record things. I felt like one day I wouldnt be here to tell anyone what had happened to me. It was really like coming into the workplace that I work in and seeing other people lose people which kept me going because I always felt like there was someone worse off than me. I was just grinning and bearing it and trying to get on with it. It was hard. I was absolutely terried. I was numb. At work nothing would affect me because I constantly felt numb throughout it all. I felt like it wasnt real. I was so tired, so exhausted and I was just getting through each day - although I dont know how. I was running on nothing. I wasnt eating. [Making those recordings] was like a survival instinct. I thoughtone day they go on my laptop, they will see what he did to me. I was hiding evidence on my laptop in case anything ever came of it and I wasnt here to tell the story. I kind of came to terms with it because I just knew it was a matter of time. I never saw an escape or thought Id be able to get through it. I never saw any positive from it, I just thought this is my le now for the rest of my le, however long it lasts. I would just have to get up, get on and deal with it because I was not sleeping, eating. Everything was so restricted.  It was her first relationship and although she says she saw signs of abusive behaviour from the startshe made exceptions for him because she was young and in love. However, after the pair got engaged on Staceys st birthday in , she claims Heavens behaviour changed. The court heard the couples relationship soured in Christmas  after he suffered bouts of paranoia due to his cocaine use. Stacey claims she would often visit her mum for a cup of tea after she finished work, and Heavens became jealous and paranoid about where she was. She says Heavens kept picking arguments with her about it until he allegedly bit her and bruised her upper arm with his teeth. Stacey says she tried to defend herself against his punches and hair pulling but eventually became frightened and apologised for her actions until she convinced herself she deserved the abuse. Too terried to even tell her family, she made excuses to avoid showing them her scars and bruises - including keeping her coat on as she ate Christmas dinner with her mum. Stacey said: For months after I left him I used to cry every time I heard the birds tweeting because it would remind me of that sense that Ive got through another night. He used to put me through absolute hell. It was never really spoken about [between us]. I tried to forget it because I knew the next night would be worse. If I pulled it up on what hed done it would have made my night worse the night after it.  One night he was asking me five questions on his hand: have I ever been disloyal to him, have I ever done this or that. I answered all of them perfectly and because it was his mind that was so out of control he started to go back over the five questions. He got to the third, and the next thing I remember was him hitting me right in the face. My ears were ringing and I just remember going funny. I saw my work logo and I remember looking at it and then myself in the mirror and thinking who are you. I thought in my brain I know that from somewhere, I know that, what is that. I was so confused in my brain I didnt know where I was. I kept saying who are you, whats happened, why am I here to him. I ended up curling into a ball and lay at the bottom of the bed. I remember turning my back to him and trying to go so close to him and trying to make him hug me because I was terried he was going to kill us both or just me or himself.  Brave Stacey found the strength to flee her home shortly before her rd birthday in October . She packed a bag and moved into her mums house while Heavens was at work. But despite not being with him for more than a year, Stacey claims she still feels that he has some control over her mind - although she is slowly learning to find happiness again. Stacey said: In the end I moved up to my mums when he went to work. I got all my stuff together. He was still living in my house for two days afterwards. After three days passed my mum looked at me and said, what has he done to you. She said I just looked at a wall for two days straight and didnt make any comment of why Id come. He would say he was coming to the door and was texting and ringing me. He was counting down on text message like , , , andyou dont answer then Im coming through the house. I had to tell everyone because he was going to do something to me or my family. We just got the police involved from there on. Obviously my family have supported me, and Ive stayed with my mum ever since.  You cant live a normal le even though Im out of it. I would be scared to leave the house just in case. I was rated as the highest priority with the police because of what he was doing to me in my relationship. In over a year while Ive not been with him Ive gained three stone and Im a lot happier. That was just living in a box room at my mums house with nothing. I took nothing with me. Ive never been back to the room where it happened. He was that controlling that, even a year and more on, he still has control over me. He still crosses my mind every time I make a decision. Still. Thats how much hes affected me. He was just so controlling over everything. A simple yes or no would be overridden by him. Even my mum said to me not so long ago that Im finally starting to say yes when I mean yes and no when I mean no. The last year Ive realised how much hes pulled my family apart. I just look at my mum and think shes aged five years in one year knowing whats happened to me. Now I sit and think to myself how could somebody do that to somebody  I didnt deserve to be treated like that. I am definitely feeling positive about the future now. Now the dust has settled and theres an outcome, I want to help others. I want to start my own safe place just to say to other people there is an escape because you literally cannot see an escape when youre going through it.

Posting on Facebook months ahead of her  wedding, the woman gave four outfit options with size guidelines. She explained the rather unusual requirements are because the couple are planning a fun wedding video and the guests will all be a part of it.

When we spin and lt our feet, the effect will amaze you. However women who weight more than st should wear a black jumper and trousers with a pair of heels. Men who weigh between lbs and lbs are asked to wear a purple fluffy jacket and all white trainers.   If theyre over lbs they need to wear all camouflage with black trainers. After the evening ceremony guests must change, but there are more rules for the evening outfits. While there are no specic requirements, the bride has asked they look appropriate for the extremely upscale celebrations. Shes asked that guests invest in an outfit which costs around ,AUS.

On  Nov , I was privileged to participate in Girls Takeover Parliament. I was paired with Ms Gai Brodtmann, Member for Canberra and I had an amazing experience. I am very passionate about girls and young people having a voice in our country, which Gai mentioned in her  second speech to Parliament and I feel that I need to bring an issue to your attention. I was so excited to attend Question Time for the first time ever but was very disappointed and embarrassed by how a majority of the Parliamentarians behaved. Ella went on to explain that during her visit, she saw about six Members of Parliament get kicked out of the chamber and that these people were setting a very bad example for young people.   She continued: I think they should be setting a better example by behaving more respectfully, listening to each other, letting each others talk and express their ideas and not shouting at each other, because this achieves nothing. The youngster admitted she didnt think school children should visit Parliament House anymorethats how people were going to behave, but instead the MPs should come to her school to see how they run their student parliament. We respect others, listen when they are speaking, give supportive suggestions to their ideas and make sure to uphold our school values, everybody counts. She then pleaded with the Prime Minister to fix the problem: As Prime Minister you have the power to affect change and I ask you to be a change leader in creating a more respectful, inclusive, co-operative and supportive culture in Parliament.

The image, posted on Instagram by a New Zealand law firm, was taken after the young grads passed the challenging bar examination. Andyou look closely at it, you can see something isnt quite right - with some of the groups hands apparently clasping at thin air. This is because the grads - all above the legal drinking age - had been holding champagne glasses when the picture was taken. However, the glasses were edited out of the image by the firm, Simpson Grierson, before it was uploaded to the social media site. The edit was made in a bid to ensure the groups achievements were the centre of attention, according to the New Zealand Herald.The firm reportedly wanted to make the post all about the graduates admission to the bar and how important it is for them. The post, which has since been removed and replaced with a dferent image, read: Congratulations to our  law graduates. This talented bunch was recently admitted to the bar — keep up the good work team. After the digital edit was spotted, human resources consultant Poncho Rivera-Pavon, who is in charge of law graduates and summer clerks for Simpson Grierson, explained why it had been made.He told Newsroom: Were very aware of the media sometimes misconstruing things and making it look like its all about the young lawyers having a drink at work.  We wanted to make it all about their admission to the bar and how important it is for them, so we decided to remove the glasses. A Simpson Grierson spokesman said the glasses were taken out so the focus would be on the graduates awesome milestone. Speaking to Stuff, the spokesman added that the firm was sorry for any unwanted attention that the graduates had since received.The new picture, which replaced the digitally altered snap, shows the group smiling widely while gathered around a sofa.Founded in , Simpson Grierson has hundreds of employees based at offices in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.It is ranked among the top legal firms in New Zealand.

It can really hurt teams,” said Jim.“We didn’t utilise Jesse and Calvin’s pace nearly enough at Hibs but they are still young and they are still learning their positions.“We have that pace, though, andyou take our three midfielders last Saturday, although Paul McGowan doubled up as a striker because of the system we wanted to play, you look at Martin Woods, you look at Glen Kamara you look at Paul McGowan, every one of them can pick a pass.“They are clever players and they can spot a pass, sowe make the runs early enough we can use that. We have Kenny Miller’s nous as well because he makes clever runs up front.”Looking towards Wednesday’s vital home clash with Hamilton, Jim will have the same squad as was on duty in the capital to pick from.“There were a few bumps and bruises but nothing serious and they should all be OK.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dee boss macca demands more of men ahead of hectic schedule","story":"As he works to turn Dundee’s season round, boss Jim McIntyre has told his players to speak up – when things go right as well as wrong.Jim himself has never been slow to let players from the technical area knowthey’ve not been pulling their weight.He also believes praise, when praise is due, must be dished out.And he wants that attitude to spill over onto the pitch during games and even in training.“We need to be demanding of each other. It can’t just come from the manager, it’s got to come from the players who are on the park,” he said.“That’s what we’ve been encouraging since we came in the door.“If somebody needs a rocket, then they get it, but encourage after that.“If they need told ‘you need to do better’, then tell them. That’s a big part of the game, but then it’s got to be equal measure of praise as well and that’s important.”It’s something Jim wants from his squad as a whole because he knows most will be called into action during a December programme that will bring seven games in just three-and-a-half weeks.A run of games that starts with Hamilton on Wednesday and ends with the pre-winter break Tayside derby against St Johnstone on December , will stretch resources but the gaffer is viewing it as a chance to pick up vital points.“It’s the same for everyone. It’s just about making sure you are recovering well between games and getting ready to go. There’s not a lot of turn around between games.“It’s an opportunity for us to maximise as many points as we can and get back into the pack.“But we’re going to need every one of the squad.“It’s a tough, tough period and there will be times when we just make changes simply because we need to freshen it, not just based on the performance.”Between now and the winter break, Jim will pay particular attention to his “over s” like Darren O’Dea, Martin Woods, Paul McGowan and Kenny Miller.At , striker Miller is comfortably the old man of the Dens Park squad.Jim, though, knows ultimately their experience will help tell them how their bodies are and whether or not they need a break from games or even training.“As a manager, I’ve always made sure that I look after the older players in the group.“I think when you are that age it’s your mentality, you know what it takes to get yourself through a game.“You know what you need to do to recover, you know how your body is.“Equally, you know when to say ‘here we go again’, it’s game time and let’s get ourselves going.”Dundee’s U s are in action this evening when they travel to take on Hearts at the Oriam .And their Youth Cup cash with Clachnacuddin takes place at Station Park on Sunday week."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c07d657d12d4.jpg ","title":"dundee united can follow ayrs example in how to react to a rout","story":"Dundee United are licking their wounds after a mauling dished out by Ayr at the weekend – to get back on track, though, they can take a leaf out of the Honest Men’s book.The Tangerines were given a home humbling by former manager Ian McCall’s league leaders on Friday night to bring Robbie Neilson’s Tannadice revival to a shuddering halt.The United boss has described the result as a “boulder in the road” rather than just a bump and is hoping his side can put the result firmly behind them by going straight out and making it six wins from Robbie’s first eight matches in charge by beating Greenock Morton on Saturday.And for inspiration they don’t have to look too far.Just like United were going into Friday night’s clash, Ayr were riding the crest of a wave at the start of the season.Seven wins and two draws from their opening nine fixtures of the campaign saw them continue the superb form that led them to the League One title last season.That run included a - win at Dens Park against Premiership Dundee, where the Honest Men completely outplayed the top-flight side, and a - home win over a Dunfermline side that had started the campaign strongly, too.Then, however, came their own shuddering halt to the form that had seen them sweep almost all before them on September  at Palmerston.Queen of the South had enjoyed a fairly up-and-down beginning to the season and weren’t expected to be the first team to stop Ayr’s momentum.A first-half blitz, however, shocked the rest of the Championship as Queens rattled up a four-goal lead inspired by their main man Stephen Dobbie and his partner-in-crime Gary Harkins.A hat-trick inside  minutes had the Doonhamers cruising before Harkins curled in against his old side with  minutes on the clock.Dobbie added a fourth in the closing stages to seal victory and give the Honest Men their first real test of the campaign.Many expected the wheels to come off at that point, as has happened to plenty of teams before, and for the newly- promoted Honest Men to fall back down the table.That looked the case the following week, too, as Falkirk, under new boss Ray McKinnon, raced into a - lead within  minutes at Somerset Park.However, that’s where the rot stopped – something Dundee United will be keen to emulate this coming Saturday, though they’d prefer not to give hosts Morton a lead first.The second half saw Lawrence Shankland find the net before a quickfire double from Andy Geggan and a Leo Fasan own goal gave Ayr the kind of response Robbie Neilson is desperate for.From there, McCall’s side have lost just the once – to Ross County – and drawn with Queens and Morton to regain top spot in the table.And they more than cemented that on Friday night at Tannadice.The question now for Dundee United is whether they can emulate their title rivals by getting back on form as quickly as possible.Victory against Morton would be one step closer to the manager’s goal of promotion while anything  would allow both Ayr and Ross County to open up a sizeable gap above the Tannadice club.However, Ayr have shown the Tangerines how to recover from a hammering – the test for Robbie Neilson and his men is whether they can do the same to get that “boulder” out of their way, starting on Saturday at Cappielow."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/Filip-Zmudzinski.jpg ","title":"karate kids return to dundee with five medals from european event","story":"Sport Karate East’skids led the way as the club ed to Dundee with a haul of five medals from the seven athletes that took part in the Lisbon International Open.SKE were in Portugal at the weekend for the prestigious European tournament with youngsters Lewis Bryson, Liam Collins, Eve Watt, Daisy Hutchison and Filip Zmudzinski taking podium places on the Sunday.The year-end event, contested by nearly , athletes, also saw both Billie Ross and Matthew Pratt narrowly miss out on prizes – finishing fth and seventh respectively in their sections on the Saturday.However, SKE’s young guns were inspired to avenge for their club-mates and were magnicent on day two of the championships.Bryson and Collins were the first up on the podium – winning bronze medals in the male U  – kgs category.Next up in the female U  – kgs category was Hutchison and Watt who were able to take home silver and bronze respectively.Last but by no means least, Zmudzinski was on fire on the tatami in the male U  – kgs section.He was able to scoop a silver medal after battling his Italian opponent so hard to take gold across five rounds.Of his and the whole squad’s performance, youth development director Richard Mallinson said: “Filip is on the ascent as this was his first international final.

I could say ‘I’m going to change things’ and the team knew that, the coaching staff knew that and the club knew that as well but ultimately it comes down to results.“Outside influences can be strong and the club felt they wanted a change.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Darren Boyd, of Thornyflat Street in Ayr, admitted to assaulting David Mackie on July  this year at McLean Street in Ayr. He also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him. Boyd appeared before Sherf Scott Pattison at Ayr Sherf Court last week. The court heard how the -year-old ‘repeatedly punched’ Mr Mackie on the head. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin explained: “At around pm, the complainers were at their home when they heard a noise and went to see what it was. There was a household item lying in the garden. They went to speak to the neighbour about why this was there. “The accused was in the neighbour’s house and assaulted the complainer by repeatedly punching him on the head. “The complainer then went home and the accused went back into the neighbour’s house. The police were contacted and the complainer had a small cut on his lip - he was taken to AE. “Police were unable to find the accused as he had left the neighbours house at that time. “On another occasion, it seems that the complainers were driving to the locus and the accused was shouting towards them saying, “I am going to kick your c**t in”.  “Police were contacted again about these matters.” Defending Boyd, Tony Currie added that Mr Mackie was the neighbour of his partner and there had been “ongoing issues” between them. He said: “These incidents were because of his partner’s ongoing issues with the complainer. “She was receiving ongoing complaints from them. “He had been at his partner’s house at the moment the complainer came to the door, who was kicking the door and was challenging towards his partner. “She was heavily pregnant at the time.” Mr Currie added that there has been no further issues in the interim and the couple are hoping to relocate. Sherf Pattison said: “I was considering sending you to jail - you need to know that this type of violence cannot continue.” As an alternative to custody, Sherf Pattison ordered Boyd to carry out a community payback order with  hours of unpaid work to be completed in nine months.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13689315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS170228854.jpg","title":"ayr uniteds somerset park football","story":"NewsAyr Uniteds Somerset Park football ground damaged as car ploughs into turnstilesThe vehicle smashed into historic Somerset Park shortly before pm last night.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSomerset Park damaged after car crashes into ground\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football clubs stadium has been badly damaged after a car ploughed straight through its turnstiles.

Chemo treatment is to be axed at either Ayr or Crosshouse Hospital, a health board meeting heard on Monday. Heath bosses at NHS Ayrshire  Arran are considering a huge shake-up of cancer services.  Previously it was proposed Crosshouse Hospital would be home to the cancer unit but bosses insist they are now considering Ayr too. Peter Maclean, clinical director, cancer services, said: “The next stage is to determine where the site will be.” The NHS Ayshire  Arran health board meeting was told a new model for cancer treatment is being proposed across the whole of the West of Scotland. Non-executive board member Ian Welsh said there is concern about moving services away from Ayr. As well as the main cancer unit, new outreach treatment hubs could be available where but they would only cater for low-risk cases. Nurse director Professor Hazel Borland said the outreach service could be located at Ayrshire Central Hospital in Irvine. She added: “For the next  to  months there will be no change. It continues as it is.” Councillor Joe Cullinane raised the issue of consultation and said any change at Ayr would become political. He added: “At the end of the day cancer touches most people’s lives in our community.” Chief executive John Burns said the ambition was to deliver the “best care we can to our population”. He added: “We need to think of it as a pathway, not just a building.” Councillor Laura Brennan-Whitefield wanted more information on the outreach cancer treatment. She said: “There has been a question mark over Ayr Hospital since . For me it is such a big thing. We have to have a sight of what the final result will be.” The chosen hospital would undergo an upgrade to host the cancer unit. A paper presented to the board said it was proposed: “NHS Ayrshire  Arran would have one cancer unit and should seek to determine optimal provision of outreach services as appropriate.” The proposed West of Scotland service model was endorsed by the board.

Alexander MacKenzie, , of Galloway Avenue in Ayr, was caught with a sick collection of illegal material involving animals and others showing children thought to be as young as one-year old. Police discovered the sick creep had a total of approximately  images. One involved two women and a black dog. And images displayed naked kids – the youngest aged between one and three. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that police carried out a search on September  last year and uncovered a USB stick and HP computer terminal storing MacKenzie’s disgusting collection. Officers attended at the home MacKenzie shares with his elderly mother. She stated he was at work and told officers she only used the computer for online banking. His mum told officers that MacKenzie used the computer everyday – to go online, for Facebook and “something to do with animals”.  Mackenzie, who has a previous conviction, appeared at court last Wednesday for sentencing. Solicitor Chris Munro said: “This is something that has spiralled, causing him to possess the images. “It’s a fairly low volume of images. “This is a matter of possession rather than distribution. “He appreciates these are particularly serious matters and custody may be on your lordship’s mind. “He resides with his mother and Mr Mackenzie is her registered carer. “She clearly would face some problemsMr Mackenzie was sent to prison today. “He has a relatively close bond with his mother.” Sherf Desmond Leslie replied: “[I have] concerns with the previous conviction and the superficial appreciation of the disposal that was made at that time.”  Mr Munro replied: “There is clearly a risk here but that can be managed in the community.” Stepping back from custody, the Sherf imposed a y community payback order. The perv was sentenced to three years supervision and as a requirement must attend the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. He was tagged for nine months where he must remain in his home address from pm - am. And he was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years. MacKenzie pled guilty to being in possession of a quantity of extreme pornographic images depicting in an explicit and realistic way bestiality between adults and animals between June ,  and September , . He also admitted having in his possession indecent photos or pseudo-photos of children from June ,  and September , .

They would be used by mountain bikers, walkers and horse riders.ldquoI think a few folk have been getting excited thinking it is going to be the new Glentress. But just to put it into perspective, the Glentress area is  times bigger than the area we have here.ldquoThis project wouldnrsquot be a rival to Glentress. It would complement it as it would be another great attraction for the central Borders.Early drawings suggest the trails begin near Galashiels Golf Club, run over the Glendearg area and into Langlee.Mr Laing added: ldquoGoing by trails I have designed in the past, I am an optimist and would say the project would cost no more than poundmillion.ldquoThat isnrsquot a set figure, it could change.

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9105562.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ten-of-the-most-unique-scottish-food-brands","story":"For those hoping to shop local and support Scottish producers, there are a wealth to choose from using only the finest ingredients.From chocolate toconfectionery, fish to cheese, there are an array of producers throughoutthe country to pick from.Discover tenScottish producers who are admired year-round for their commitment to quality and great flavour.----------------------------------Bells Food GroupBells Food Group has been part of the Scottish food landscape since  when an enterprising local baker began working from home, selling a few tasty treats in his local town.

An intergovernmental concordat, setting out the proposals, is due to be published later this week.Appearing before the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee, Mr Mundell told MPs he would welcome a move to more joint trade delegations as this would produce better value for taxpayers.It was pointed out how on some occasions UK and Scottish Government representatives had visited the same country but separately.ldquoI am very open and conducive to working together, declared Mr Mundell. ldquoThere is continued scope for closer working. Irsquom sure thatrsquos what business and industry bodies want.Later, when quizzed about the possibility of the Prime Minister and First Minister going on joint trade missions, the Scottish Secretary told The Herald: \"I see no reason why that shouldnt happen. Businesses shouldnt have to choose whether they work with the UK Government or the Scottish Government. I see no impediment to that...Businesses would welcome that combined approach.\"George Hollingbery, the International Trade Minister, giving evidence alongside Mr Mundell, stressed that at present the UK Government ldquoengaged widely with the devolved administrations but suggested there would be more liaison going forward post Brexit, referring to the intergovernmental concordat, which, he explained, would ldquoincorporate the Scottish Government into the way the UK Government approached new trade deals.Askedthis meant Scottish Government ministers would be inside the negotiating room, Mr Hollingbery replied: ldquoThe offer we are making is a full and fair one and that will satisfy any reasonable observer that the devolved authorities are having a full part in the process of not only creating the outlines of our future trade agreements but also having a role further down the line.The SNPrsquos Pete Wishart, who chairs the committee, noted how people were waiting with ldquogreat excitement about what was about to be announced.However, the minister noted how one or two of the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposals to be involved in post Brexit free trade agreements were at the ldquofar end of the bargaining scale and that their suggestion of the need to get Edinburghrsquos consent was ldquonot on the table and will never be on the table.Mr Hollingbery later stressed: ldquoItrsquos not right, however close we want to bring the devolved administrations, to take their advice and for them to represent the interests of their particular areas and responsibilities, to allow them to have an effective veto at any stage.

With the Scottish Government having vowed to phase out new petrol and diesel cars by , there is a dawning realisation that going electric is no longer a green-themed lestyle choice itrsquos a necessity.Poor air quality is believed to contribute to more than , premature deaths in the UK annually, with emissions from cars and vans costing the NHS around pound billion each year.The answer to eliminating pollution is to invest in zero-emission transport. The big question is: are we prepared for a mass uptake of EVs One new study is positive, suggesting Scotland is accelerating in the transition to EVs faster than the rest of the UK.The report by Imperial College London and ETech, commissioned by the Drax Group, shows Scotland powering ahead in terms of numbers of EV charging points being made available and the purchasing or leasing of vehicles.Motorists registered  alternative fuel vehicles in Scotland last year ndash thatrsquos a % rise on the  sold in .Meanwhile, there were , such cars sold in the rest of the UK, a rise of only % on the , in .This article was published in the December edition ofBusinessHQ -Click here to viewThe uptake in purely electric cars raced ahead, with a % rise to  registrations in Scotland compared with a % rise to , in the rest of the UK.The Drax report also highlights the fact Scotland has seen a successful sht from dependence on fossil fuels to harnessing renewable energy, meaning the creation of a full circle of zero-emission power.There is support, too, for EV buyers in the form of the Scottish Governmentrsquos intention to expand interest-free loans for EVs and hybrids.Transport Scotland, meanwhile, is inviting notfor- profit housing associations and co-operatives to apply for a share of pound, to secure the services of EV car clubs.Matthew Eastwood, Head of Transport at Energy Saving Trust, commented: ldquoPlugged-in Households enables access to electric vehicles irrespective of income or location.ldquoNot-for-profit housing associations and co-operatives in Scotland can apply for grant funding to procure the services of a zero-emission car club for use by their tenants, their own use and that of the wider local community.The latest generation of EVs, themselves, are becoming more affordable ndash and more attractive ndash as manufacturers battle to win over customers.Wersquove come a long way from actor Leonardo DiCaprio extolling the virtues of the Toyota Prius.Todayrsquos EVs are much sexier: from the Tesla Model X to the BMW i to the Jaguar I-Pace, which won Car of the Year and Best Alternative Fuel Car at the  Scottish Car of the Year awards.The electric SUV has been championed by Scottish tennis star Andy Murray, who says: ldquoJaguar is a great British brand and has changed a lot since I was young. Itrsquos making modern, younger cars, like the electric cars ndash one of the first big companies to do it ndash and the I-Pace is great to drive.ldquoWrongly, I assumed you wouldnrsquot be able to go very far with it but you can go  miles, which is obviously a long trip, so itrsquos great.ldquoI charged up once in a service station and that was fine. Obviously itrsquos a little bit longer than filling up in a petrol station, but the reason for me having to do that was that I hadnrsquot planned in advance. Now I charge the car pretty much every night when Irsquom at home.Volkswagen, whose emissions tampering scandal was a catalyst for the debate thatrsquos seen diesel cars vilied, is upping production while reducing the price of its EVs. Its new strategy could see  million models produced, with pound. billion investment set aside for battery procurement.The German marque is aiming to produce , examples of a brand new EV, known as the MEB Entry. A direct rival to the Tesla Model , itrsquos expected to retail for around pound,. It is also building , of its mid-sized ID Aero in a plant currently making the fossil-fuelled Passat.While such models are expected to be more efficient ndash helping reduce range anxiety for motorists ndash they do rely on a charging infrastructure that must be fit for purpose while seeing a huge upsurge in demand.Figures released by the RAC Foundation show Scotlandrsquos chargers were used , times during August, , compared with , times in the same month in  ndashan increase of %.Research carried out by HSBC Commercial Banking found there are  publicly funded charge points for electric vehicles in Scotland, meaning there are  people for every charger. Although this means Scotland has an above-average number of public charge points per person, itrsquos evident more can be done.Scott McClurg, head of energy and sustainability for HSBC Corporate Banking, says: ldquoIf Scotland is to sht to electric vehicles in the long term, the overall volume of charge points has to improve across the board.ldquoWhile there are clear opportunities to meet rising demand through the private sector, local authorities and central government are also looking closely at this space to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.Scottish Power Energy Networks is also calling for more investment. Itrsquos already supported a range of decentralised energy measures through a Green Economy Fund.Established by the Distribution Network Operatorto support the Scottish Governmentrsquos ambitious climate change targets, pound million has been awarded to more than a dozen initiatives.These include the development of a mobile app, WattsUp, an EV route planner designed to guide drivers to their nearest charging bay.The Fund is also supporting the collection of information from network operators to offer motorists real-time data on available chargers.The Heraldrsquos newest partner in our Climate For Change campaign, Newton Property, has a range of clean and green ambitions that include fitting its nationwide property portfolio with chargers. Of course, innovation in charging capabilities ultimately will be key to making EVs a success. Shell is making great strides in new technology with the planned installation of its first ultrafast charging points in Europe.Derek MacDonald,Joint Managing Director of Newton Property ManagementIt claims they can add km of range to a carrsquos battery in just five minutes or fully recharge in  minutes ndash thatrsquos three times faster than todayrsquos best chargers.The downside is theyrsquore so powerful no car can use them yet.

Coupled with the geopolitical challenges on the horizon ndash from Brexit to Chinarsquos plastic recycling import ban ndashitrsquos understandable that firms are feeling some anxiety. But running an economy on fewer natural resources is a problem that Zero Waste Scotland is determined to crack.We have already seen the cost of raw materials become a big concern for Scottish businesses. Back in January, a Scottish Chamber of Commerce survey revealed that % of businesses were anxious about the rising costs of raw materials and their impact on prices.Responding to these pressures requires big ideas and new ways of doing business. And new ways of thinking are at the heart of the circular economy that Zero Waste Scotland is working with businesses across Scotland to deliver.This article was published in the December edition ofBusinessHQ - click here to viewWe want to help build an economy where resources are valued. Itrsquos a message with an environmental heart but also a hard-headed business sense. As materials become scarcer and costs more prohibitive, the need to make sure we keep them in circulation for as long as possible and extract their full potential economic and social value becomes more urgent.But this challenge has also inspired some great creative thinking.Zero Waste Scotlandrsquos business support service is designed to help companies with big ideas explore more circular ways of doing business which can result in resource efficiencies, improved profitability, higher quality products, increased customer base and alternative supply chains for your business. This support has already helped more than  SMEs in Scotland.Jenner Grfith and Mathew Bonner were at the event to collect EGG Lightingrsquos Circular Breakthrough award at The Heraldrsquos Global Game Changers Awards.One business to benefit from this support has been EGG Lighting, who are working to reduce the waste in LED lighting. LED lighting is much more energy efficient th fluorescent-style lights that us commonplace in most comme industrial buildings. However,with thetechnology advancing at a rapid rate,regular upgrades are leading to high levels of material waste. What makes this all the more frustrating is that while entire units were being disposed of, the technological changes only affected a small part of the physical infrastructure.EGG Lighting had a smart solution to this problem. They designed a modular system that allowed businesses to keep using the same fittings and replace only the parts that were essential for accessing the new technology.For six months, EGG has been working with the Scottish logistics, construction and distribution specialists W H Malcolm to put their modular approach to the test. The trial has been supported by Zero Waste Scotland, with support from European Regional Development Funds and the Scottish Government.EGG is pioneering a service model that would see businesses continue to receive regular upgrades to the technology, but without having to replace the entire unit. That way, they get the benefits of the latest LED technology, without constantly forking out for new lights and without having to dispose of the entire unit.Zero Waste Scotland also offers support through the Circular Economy Investment Fund, which has delivered more than pound million in support from the Scottish Government and the European Regional Development Fund. This funding has helped bring the latest D printing technology to Scotland,turn used coffee grounds into valuable bio-oils and kick start the creation of a transformational plastics recovery plant in Perth.From reducing costs to unlocking new markets, there are clear economic benefits in adopting a more circular approach to resources, products and services.

It was full of nettles and less than a metre wide. We managed to enter it and there was a section of boulders ndash we moved them out of the way and then there was a ft drop. That led to a spectacular chamber  yards by  feet ndash big enough to stand up in. The stones were blue and purple. It was some incredible sight.ldquoWe managed to explore  yards before finding the route choked with sediment. We plan towith a team in the New Year to dig it out and explore further.ldquoThe theory and hope is it could extend all the way to Smoo Cave which would make it by far the longest cave in Scotland and with the most spectacular of entrances ndash or exits, depending on the start point ndash at Smoo.Scotlandrsquos longest cave is currently the Cave of the Sloping Rock in nearby Assynt which is . miles long.The longest cave system in the UK is the Three Counties System in the Yorkshire Dales, with . miles of passageway, while the longest in the world is the appropriately-named Mammonth Cave in Brownsville, Kentucky with more than  miles explored.Smoo Cave is the largest coastline cave in the British Isles and has provided shelter for thousands of years. It is believed to have been a Stone Age home more than , years ago with Norse settlers later gathering here to repair boats and fish for herring.It has one of the largest entrances to any sea cave in Britain at  ft high. It was formed by a burn that runs down into the rear chamber, as well as erosion caused by the sea.Mr Greig added: ldquoIf it links up to the new discovery it will be one of the best caving experiences in the UK. It is a treasure trove for geologists. Over the two days we have explored the new cave we even found a white freshwater eel which has never seen sunlight.ldquoThe drought helped us because the cave floods in wet conditions, and up to the roof in places.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond. Sadly the whole of our public sector is suffering from the impact of funding cuts and we must now end austerity and fund the le line services that our people need.Share your views by emailing us at newsdesk@spp-groupThursday  Dec  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

She believes that voting for that deal is way to resolve these issues.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4839946.1544034461!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit s causes would remain even if it s prevented malcolm bruce","story":"The UK needs to find ways to improve the lives of justiably angry people who voted for Brexit, writes Liberal Democrat peer Malcolm Bruce.The Brexit referendum opened deep isions within the UK between those who feel ignored, frustrated and forgotten, and an apparently indferent establishment.Globalisation has left many better off. However, it has also led to rapid change which, for many people, has meant the decline of their communities whose economic reason to exist has moved where. We may have record numbers in employment, but many people find themselves stuck in low-paid, insecure jobs. People are angry, and justiably so. People have seen their pay cut and opportunities diminish while those driving the economy got richer even when it was their decisions had made millions poorer. The excesses of capitalism must be addressed. We must enact economic reforms to ensure a fairer society. Liberal democracy is based on markets, free trade and free enterprise. But these need to be servants, not masters of a liberal society. One major issue is the UK economy is consumer driven. We inflate the value of our real estate, borrow against these assets and buy goods and services which mostly we don’t produce.One way to tackle this would be to introduce land-value taxation. This would not only discourage speculative land hoarding, but it is an initial step in introducing taxes on wealth rather than income. It ensures that those iniduals with high-value net worth contribute fairly to the community. Land and property speculation should no longer be the principal driver of our economy.In Germany, their economy is driven by investmentand skills and company ownership is held more through direct investors and workers, rather than institutional shareholders looking for short-term gains. The Liberal Democrats have long called for workers representative on boards, the encouragement of worker share ownership, and partnerships and supervisory boards with wider responsibilities than just shareholder . Liberal Democrats believe that it is vital that everyone is given a stake in our economy, that we can only be united and competitive as a countrythe rewards are reaped by all.: Brexit deal will cost us £bn, says Nicola SturgeonThe UK still suffers tension between the roles of the state and the private sector, instead of the promotion of creative partnership. People are also being confronted with utilities raising prices ahead of inflation whilst delivering poor service. Rail services are equally expensive and unreliable.To answer this, Labour has revitalised its Marxist-Leninist credentials and is proposing wholesale nationalisation. To a younger generation with no memory of the Soviet Union or the tussles over Clause  of the Labour Party constitution, it might seem attractive to bring gas, electricity, water and the railways back into public ownership.After all, wouldn’t that mean fuel bills would be kept down and the trains would run on time with lower fares  Not necessarily. British Rail was famous for dreadful food, poor timekeeping and under-investment.How would Labour pay for the shares and how would utilities and railways secure funding in competition with health, education, and welfare  Seizing the assets would destroy investment and collapse pension funds. It would be far better to give consumers and rail passengers a more direct role in the running of these companies, rather than having to own them.: Police Scotland officers could be sent to Northern Ireland during BrexitMuch of the inequality in the United Kingdom can be attributed to where you live. Therefore, it is vital we unlock the positive energy of our communities. In Scotland, having our own Parliament with signicant powers gives us control of our domestic affairs to address our distinctive needs and culture. We should be using those powers to pursue policies to improve our quality of le and strengthen our economy, which remains too dependent on the public sector. That does not mean we should cut public sector funding or privatise sectors. Rather we should seek to grow the private sector and with it the tax base.However, we have seen over the past year what little regard the Conservative Government has for devolving powers. The Brexit process has been abused with powers being taken to Whitehall that should have been devolved. The loss of £. billion of European Structural and Investment Funds is only likely to make the problems faced by disadvantaged areas worse. Local authorities must have their powers and sources of funding guaranteed. Local autonomy with real financial muscle is the only sustainable answer to the regional ide. That is why the Government must support our call to devolve more decision-making power over key levers of economic development including transport, housing and skills. We must do more to tackle regional inequality where you are born should not affect your chance of prosperity.All of this makes clear that it is time for a new People’s Contract. We must end the politics of ision, espoused in ious forms by the Tories, Labour and the SNP and bring the country together. When looking at the referendum vote, we must not only call for a People’s Vote to end the Brexit chaos in the short term, but we must address why people voted leave in the first place. If we are to achieve a fairer, less ided society we must reform our economy so that everyone has the means to get by and the chance to get on.Malcolm Bruce is the Liberal Democrat’s spokesperson for Northern Ireland  Scotland in the House of Lords©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4291381.1479396040!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish new car sales motor ahead","story":"Scotland#s car dealers notched up a  per cent rise in new registrations last month, bucking the downward trend seen where in the UK.Industry leaders pointed to a resilient start to December after figures showed , new cars were registered to Scottish addresses during November, up from , in the same month a year earlier.Sandy Burgess, chief executive of the Scottish Motor Trade Association, said: “ has proved to be a very unsettling year for our industry, with the shortage of products that we experienced in our peak selling month of September due to the new WLTP regulations and the effects of that dreaded word Brexit on the consumer confidence.“It really is testimony to the resilience of the Scottish market that we are experiencing growth in the twilight months of the year.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

The college’s Patient Group is reminding people about the important ‘ Before GP’ message. Karen Mooney, chair, said: “This winter, we know that our GP practices are going to be under immense strain, and we can do our bit to help support our health service. Think about what you really need think  Before GP. “Can you care for yourself and manage minor ailments at home  Can you find the advice you need using safe and reputable online resources such as the NI Direct Stay Well website  Can you seek advice from your community pharmacist “We all have a responsibility to help protect our health services and to make sure that those who are the most ill and vulnerable in our society are able to access the care that they need.”Dr Grainne Doran, RCGPNI chair, said: “GPs strive to provide the very best care to all of our patients. Over the winter period, there is no doubt that our workload hugely increases. “For more minor conditions such as coughs and colds, patients can get great advice and over the counter medicines from local pharmacies.

This puts the whole of the United Kingdom in prime position to seize new opportunities as we leave the EU.As we establish our new relationship with Europe, the Industrial Strategy will help us to build the foundations behind our withdrawal agreement. Our prosperity and ability to build a strong economy is dependent on how we encourage innovation, develop high quality jobs and skills, and support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Northern Ireland has a world-leading reputation in key sectors, including construction and automotive, as well as future industries such as Articial Intelligence , cyber security and le sciences.The Industrial Strategy has led to specic partnerships between the government and these industries, which will help these major employers in Northern Ireland face the future outside the EU with confidence.Today I am pleased to announce, with the Business Secretary Greg Clark, £, of funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for the County Antrim-based le sciences company Randox. This will pay for the research and development of cutting-edge technology to enable diagnostic tools to be manufactured more quickly and effectively.Eventually, this will lead to more manufacturing jobs as a result.Northern Ireland is also benefiting from UK-wide funding programmes under the Industrial Strategy, including Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon who have successfully bid for £.m and Belfast for £.m as some of the  areas benefiting from the £m Full Fibre Networks Challenge fund, designed to increase connectivity across the UK.The UK has a strong economy, with eight straight years of economic growth, over  million more people in jobs, and higher employment and lower unemployment in every region and nation of the UK - we should be proud of this.We are open and enterprising, founded on invention, innovation and competition.In Northern Ireland, employment levels are almost at a record high, and the UK government is determined to build on this progress.We are at the forefront of scientic invention because we embrace change and use regulation to stimulate an environment for creativity.We have globally admired universities and research institutions, such as Queens and Ulster University, because we have nurtured our intellectual powerhouses with public investment. And we have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business because we have high standards, clear regulation and great partnerships.The UKs businesses can take on the world because they have access to a skilled workforce and modern infrastructure, and Northern Ireland is an important and growing part of that. The Prime Minister, the rest of our Cabinet colleagues and I will continue working to secure the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.At the same time we are delivering our long-term plan to support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Building on the great strides the Industrial Strategy has already taken so that after we leave the EU, our businesses and institutions are in the best possible position to build on our strengths and lead the world.Karen Bradley MP is Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"suzanne breen unionists united in opposition as remainers rally around backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted.

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"dog makes incredible save in argentinian league game","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The print industry is developing very fast and becoming increasingly technologically advanced, so the future will require staff with a strong background in STEM subjects.“While my male colleagues are great, it would be fantastic for all companies to engage with more women. I’m glad I work for a company which encourages me as a young woman in STEM. It’s very rewarding to be part of a business which is always changing, adapting and expanding. There are always opportunities to train and progress.”Although initially involved with Nuprint’s design team, developing artwork and ordering equipment, Lauren’s talents soon saw her chosen to be part of the company’s new digital department.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHaving invested heavily in a state-of-the-art HP Indigo digital printing press, Nuprint sent Lauren to Barcelona, where she learned to use the artwork pre-press software and received press operator training. She now works in Nuprint’s HP Digital Department, producing high-spec labels, sleeves and wraparound labelling for a wide range of commercial clients.Keen to raise awareness of STEM careers and companies supporting young people like herself into employment, Lauren recently helped to develop Derry City  Strabane District Council’s Business Youth Charter. The initiative highlights those local businesses helping young people into work as well as informing young people about the companies and industries.Gavin Killeen, Managing Director of Nuprint, said Lauren was a “shining example of a female in a male-dominated print industry excelling and embracing STEM.”He added: “Eager to learn new skills and increase her expertise in print, Lauren is undaunted by the challenges we constantly throw her way. With her positive attitude, ability to work under pressure and her clear thinking, she embodies Nuprint’s values and has now set a high standard for all our apprentices, both female and male. Everyone at Nuprint is very proud of Lauren and we’re delighted her hard work has been rewarded with her success at the Irish Print Awards.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch derry theatre company prepare present first ever panto","story":"Derrys Lilliput Theatre Company is putting the finishing touches to its first ever pantomime.Clare-Ellen Duddy, Senior Day Care Worker, Liliput Theatre Company said: “It’s that time of year again when we all look for something that has that “Christmassy feel” to get us in the spirit, well in true Lilliput style and to accommodate the  passionately talented actors Lilliput Theatre Company presents Let’s Do Panto - a cleverly written piece by Brian Hassan, Care Assistant at Lilliput, featuring a few of everyone’s favourite and iconic panto scenes including Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella and Peter Pan.Clare added: “Our actors have been rehearsing over the past six months and are looking forward to welcoming family, friends and the local community to their first every panto production.

To work so hard to organise this event and support fellow kidney patients is magnicent.ldquoAll their hard work and attention to detail certainly paid off and it was wonderful to be with them on the day to help out and see this couples infectious enthusiasm in action.ldquoOn behalf of Kidney Care UK I thank them for their hard work and efforts to rally so many people to support a cause which touches the lives of so many.Thanking Stephen and Christine on behalf of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, William Johnston said: ldquoIt was lovely to get the chance to join with Stephen and Christine in the beautul setting of Castle Ward and to see their enthusiasm for supporting our cause and delivering and Organ Donation message of hope.ldquoI want to say a special word of thanks to them for really pulling out the stops to put together an amazing event to help local kidney patients and their families..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaign to clamp down on dog fouling  ","story":"LOCAL council officials have unveiled a new campaign aimed at helping rid the district of its dog fouling problem.It is a particularly contentious issue and one of the single most complained about problems in the area and, despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed and there is virtually no town or village not affected by it.This week, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has launched a new awareness campaign to remind dog owners about the importance of cleaning up after their dogs.Rolled out after a survey by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul found that levels of dog fouling had increased from the previous year, the local authority is determined to get a grip on the issue.One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.While the mindset of these particular iniduals is hard to fathom and it is concerning that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind, council officials hope the new campaign can change minds.Dog owners are being reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so is leaving them open to an pound fine.In addition, dog owners are reminded that they are responsible for training their dogs properly to lsquodo their businessrsquo in their ownerrsquos garden where it can then be collected and placed in a black bin.Politicians have become increasingly frustrated at the blatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.There are a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district and council officials are prepared to do all they can to tackle the problem. Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained.

I will come back to our nineteen-year old later.Over  Gaels from Down, all over Ireland and beyond gathered in the Slieve Donard Hotel last Friday night to honour and to pay tribute to one of Downrsquos greatest ever footballers, none other than the great Colm McAlarney.His evening started with a knock on the door at his home in the Town when club chairman, Kevin Sweeney, and event organiser Kevan Owens surprised Colm in his kitchen with those immortal words ldquotonight Colm ndash this is your le.It was filmed and the first sign of his hero status became apparent ndash total shock and his humble disbelief. Then came his sudden realisation of what the meaning of the word lsquoOmertarsquo was ndash the code of silence.He didnrsquot see it coming or expect it. Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murlough runners in full flow  ","story":"ON a wet Saturday morning, some  Murlough AC members made their way across the province to Loughgall in Co Armagh to complete the third race in Born  Runrsquos Run Forest Run series.There is no other way to describe the day other than it chucked it down, our feet were well and truly soaked before the race began.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us. We are delighted with their support which I believe says a lot about this area. Our staff and parents are also very committed and we are involved in a shared education project with Sacred Heart Primary in Dundrum.Sara added: ldquoOur neighbours at St Colmcillersquos Primary School are also supporting us with the P pupils selecting Knockevin as their chosen charity and when some of the pupils visited us recently they used makaton signing to communicate with some of our students.ldquoI am lucky to be the principal of a school which enjoys the warmth and support of so many people. We have a great staff team and Knockevin has many, many family connections with the area which is so lovely..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Presentation night at Spa Golf Club  ","story":"FINAL closure on Sparsquos  playing season came on Saturday night when Marian Armstrong and Mark Smyth were named the clubrsquos golfers of the year.It was a remarkable achievement for Marian who claimed the title for a fourth time along with the addition of five other trophies she collected at Sparsquos presentation night.Meanwhile, the Spa team captains will soon be knocking on the door of Mark as they make their selections for the  inter-club matches.While this was his first golfer of the year award, he won three other trophies and over the course of the season has seen his handicap plummet from  to the present .Club captain John Robinson said it had been a great year for Spa for many reasons including the achievements of the ious teams.The Pierce Purcell squad reached the final of the competition while the Sam Rutherford and Rossmore teams also won through to the closing games.He thanked everyone for their tremendous support during his year in office including the council, club officers and staff including the green keepers who, he said, had protected and improved Sparsquos most precious asset.Congratulating all the winners, Mr Robinson said the consistent high quality of play meant it was never easy to win a trophy at Spa Golf Club, but to those who achieved their golfing ambitions in  it was a case of ldquovery well done.Lady captain Carol Shields also thanked the large number of club officers and staff who had made her term in office such an enjoyable experience.She said it had been ldquoan absolute pleasure to work with Mr Robinson, describing him as ldquoa perfect gentlemen who has been a great ambassador for Spa Golf Club.Menrsquos prizewinners: Golfer of the Year , Mark Smyth Winter League trophy, Greg Wilson, Tom Wilson and Julian Kelly Gordon Cup, Robert Gartley Sunbound Cup, Barry Stevens Shaw Cup Doubles, Larry Power and Tom Coburn Lowe Cup, John Munn Holmes Cup, Daniel Connolly Scotia Cup, David Corr John Smith Cup , Bobby Wallace and Mandy Murphy Vice-Presidentrsquos cup, Alan Stevens Mark Gibson Trophy, Gordon Martin Montalto Cup, Alan McNamara Boyd Cup, Mark Smyth Ferguson Cup, Larry Power Eric Dodd Cup, Brian McQueen Wallace Cup, Mark Smyth Joe Mulholland Cup, Chris Donaldson La Carte Trophy, David Kidd Sam Graham Cup, Daniel Connolly Action Press Cup, Daniel Connell H L Hegan Cup, Mark Smyth Plessey Cup, James Walker McIlveen Cup, Alan McNamara Caldwell Cup, Eamon Canavan D J Bell Cup, Brian Blythe Eden na Vadie Cup, Brendan McAlarney Summit Trophy, Sammy Gurr Brian Irvine Cup, Gary Simpson Walter Moore Cup, Alan Stevens Dominic Stratton Cup, Brian McGrillen Forthill Cup, Larry Power Spa Cup, Brian Rea Sunday Jug, Barry Stevens.Ladiesrsquo prizewinners: Golfer of the Year, Marian Armstrong Hugh Gordon Cup, Gwyneth Cordner Challenge Cup, Suzanne McLoughlin Caldwell Cup, Mandy Murphy Lindsay Cup, Lynsey Martin Josie Murray Cup, Gillian Earls Kinray Trophy, Beth Coburn Combat Cancer Trophy, Marian Armstrong  Challenge Trophy, Sally Ann Douglas Slieve Croob Cup, Vivienne Abernethy McRoberts Rose Bowl, Pam Trohear Harvest Cup, Catherine McEvoy Plessey Cup, Ellie Smyth Mr Presidentrsquos Cup , Lisa McCavery Victor and Rita Ginesi Cup, Mandy Murphy Sena Feneran Cup, Marian Armstrong Ladiesrsquo Foursomes Matchplay Trophy, Sally Ann Douglas and Carol Shields Howitt Cup, Gwyneth Cordner Montalto Cup, Alex Murphy Adams Aiken Trophy, Stephanie Rea McIlveen Cup, Gwyneth Cordner Hunter Cup, Marian Armstrong Lowe Cup, Gwyneth Cordner McEvoy Cup, Carol Shields Coburn Cup, Marian Armstrong Sarah Brennan Cup, Mandy Murphy Maureen Hanna Trophy, Gwyneth Cordner Lynne Robinson Trophy , Marian Armstrong..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Seaforde machine on target  ","story":"SO close for the Saints in this first round tie as they had the league leaders on the ropes for much of this match, with it only being decided on the final run of games.After last weekrsquos below par performance against the same opposition, the home side battled better in keeping the games tight as Francie McGreevy lost narrowly - to Derek McCann and Des McAuley lost - to David Boal.The next run of games saw another tight away win, this time Graham Christie beating Collie Brown -.

PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those. Over the past two years, ours was one of the community festivals that had been unsuccessful in securing council funding.Mr Casey added: ldquoAs we approach our th anniversary, it would be a boostwe knew we had funding in good time, allowing our festival to be included in tourism brochures next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17219962.meeting-support-for-necarne-plan-welcomed-by-developer/resources/images/9115843.jpg","title":"yacht club claim proposed new boathouse site by rnli would be a waste of donations","story":"Lough Erne Yacht Clubhas accused the RNLI of changing its mind over a proposed site for the building of a new boathouse and have claimed that the project would be a ldquowaste of donations.The LEYC has hosted the RNLI temporary boathouse on its site for the past  years but says that the proposed new site would ldquohave a detrimental effect on the club and sailing in the bay.Now, however, the RNLI has made a planning application for a new leboat station at Gublusk Bay and in a letter to members, seen by the Impartial Reporter, the LEYC has said that it will be objecting.In its letter, by Commodore John Carton, the LEYC has said that it is ldquodisappointed that the RNLI have decided to go ahead with their application to build a boathouse on the shore of Gublusk Bay.The letter goes on to say that the situation is ldquoespecially disappointing since the RNLI were originally given a site one mile away which would give them more visibility.In a statement the RNLI said: ldquoThe RNLI have submitted a planning application for the building of a new leboat station for Enniskillen RNLI, comprising a boathouse and associated facilities, including the erection of slipway, installation of holding tank, landscaping and associated site and access works on a site at Gublusk Bay. It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

the only child of James and Mary Millar of Aldfreck townland, Ballycarry, and she attended Mullaghmossin Public Elementary School at Magheramorne, where the principal was Mr DA Hawthorne and Miss Poag was another of her teachers.The family lived close to the main shore road through Magheramorne and she would walk a few miles up the braes from the Millar farm to Ballyedward townland, where she reached the county road which led to the school.It is a sign of the passage of time that the Mullaghmossin School she attended has long since closed down and Magheramorne, which once had at least three schools, no longer has any.The photograph of the classmates of  includes many of her neighbours Jack Millar, Tom Stuart, Tommy Liddle, Margaret Workman, Nancy Smyth, Mary Blair, Adam Semple,

raise two sons.Over the years she still maintained friendships which had been forged while she was growing up and living in Magheramorne and she always had a keen interest in the area.She was a former member of Glynn Women’s Institute, but her abiding interest was in the loyal orders, in which her two sons, Arthur and Thomas, were deeply involved over the years.Mrs Beattie was a member of the Old Orange Hall ladies committee at Magheramorne for many years, helping with events such as the installation dinners of the lodge, and also a keen supporter of Magheramorne LOL , RBP  \u2028and Magheramorne Silver Band. Among those who attended her funeral were many members of the local lodges and the Larne Black District Chapter, of which her son Arthur is Worshipful District Master.The funeral service from her son’s residence at Carrickfergus was to Raloo Presbyterian Churchyard, and was conducted at both locations by Rev Ricky Montgomery. A piper led the mourners to the graveside.Mrs Beattie was predeceased by her husband Hugh and her son Thomas, who died in .

She is growing more untrustworthy by the day. “The PM knows that once the withdrawal agreement is in place, Parliament has no say about the backstop.“The introduction of the backstop will be a legally binding arrangement as a result of the agreement, and the ending of the backstop is the responsibility of the EU, as they have the power to block it. “Lets assume parliament did have the ability to decide when the backstop would start she can’t bind any future prime minister as to what they would do. She is making promises she can’t keep.“Also,Parliament was faced with a choice of extending the transition period, which would mean the whole of the UK would stay fully in the EU and make a budget contribution of whatever the EU decided, with no rebate, do you honestly think any parliament is going to vote for that over the backstop “This is total desperation. She will say anything to try and get this deal over the line.“It shows she does not listen. We have explained to her that the only way she is going to change people’s minds is to change the agreement.”The backstop, intended to prevent theof a hard border on the island of Ireland, is highly controversial as Brexiteer MPs claim it traps the UK into obeying rules set by Brussels without a say over them.The government says it aims to conclude a comprehensive trade deal with the EU before a backstop arrangement would be needed.Backstop plan will ‘haunt us for years’, warns Trimble Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Meanwhile, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier reiterated that the agreement with Mrs May was the only deal on offer.try catch  TrendingSnow forecast for N.I. this week - tonights temperature to drop to -degCFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolGunned down in front of terried school kidsNI youngster, ,rushed to hospital after taking white powder          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Think about what you really need think  Before GP. “Can you care for yourself and manage minor ailments at home  Can you find the advice you need using safe and reputable online resources such as the NI Direct Stay Well website  Can you seek advice from your community pharmacist “We all have a responsibility to help protect our health services and to make sure that those who are the most ill and vulnerable in our society are able to access the care that they need.”Dr Grainne Doran, RCGPNI chair, said: “GPs strive to provide the very best care to all of our patients. Over the winter period, there is no doubt that our workload hugely increases. “For more minor conditions such as coughs and colds, patients can get great advice and over the counter medicines from local pharmacies.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade.

Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table.

The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.
