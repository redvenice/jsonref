Day-trippers are urged not to bring dogs.This is while extra police are on also on duty in the run up to the Fair. Last year there were 23 arrests, 17 recorded crimes and 115 incidents logged by Cumbria Police, who say it is of an equivalent level of crime to other similar events, like music festivals or football matches.\u0027Our priority is the safety of the public and minimising the impact on the local community,\u0027 said the Gold Commander.         This youngster seems to know what he is doing as he buckles up his horse as the lovely sunshine shines down on both of them          The village seems to be getting busier and busier throughout the day with many people lining either side of the streets          Raring to go!

This horse looks like it\u0027s having the time of its life as it gallops down one of the roads just outside of Appleby earlier today         Residents in Appleby have said the event has got too big for the small village. People can be seen watching while these men go through the village In the week before the fair there had been two incidents, one of abuse of a local take-away food retailer and one of serious sexual assault. In both cases offenders were caught within minutes and banished from the county.Last night, a police chase of a white van which collided with parked cars involved a local man, who was arrested.Despite the excitement around the fair not everyone is excited with many residents of Appleby having said they are fearing for their safety. Local residents are ided over the benefits, with some businesses closing down for its duration.But James Brighurst, aged 30, who runs a cafe in Bridge Street, within yards of the horse washing, said: \u0027The event brings more people into the town, which can be a bit sleepy the rest of the year.\u0027We have only had once incident in the six years we have been open, a young teenager showing off to his mates. But there is always going to be the odd incident with the number of people involved.\u0027Yesterday residents said the event has just gotten too big and that it wasn\u0027t what it had been 20 years ago.\u0027It was lovely you could walk round everyone was friendly. It\u0027s just got too big for the area.\u0027There is no respect for locals who are just trying to get on and you don\u0027t feel safe you feel threatened.\u0027         Caravans and mobile homes, as well as more traditional carts can be seen covering much of the village as people meet up and chat with each other          Those attending Appleby today are in for a treat as the weather looks to be balmy for the majority of the day - but is set to take a turn for the worse over the weekend          Decorative paintwork adorns a bow top caravan on the first day of the Appleby Horse Fair as the sun continues to shine down          Photo call!

This horse looked majestic as it received a full wash from its owners during the start of the fair todayYesterday a spokesman for the Appleby Horse Fair Multi-Agency Strategic Co-ordinating Group said: \u0027The first priority for all MASCG members is keeping people safe.\u0027In line with this priority and concerns raised about the safety of pedestrians, the MASCG is putting in place measures designed to improve pedestrian safety on The Sands.\u0027The pedestrian crossing at The Sands is to be guarded with barriers on both sides of the carriageway, keeping the pedestrian crossing free for pedestrians and removing the potential for horses travelling over the crossing to collide with people.\u0027A ersion is to be put in place, taking traffic from Battlebarrow to Bongate along Garth Heads Road.\u0027This will be the first year these measures have been put in place and they will be monitored closely by the different agencies.\u0027\u0027We continue to encourage anyone who experiences an offence to contact the police. We have a dedicated Appleby-specific 101 reporting line. Police cannot be expected to tackle issues if they are not reported.\u0027         One man was seen in shorts and a vest top as he took his horse into the waters if the river to make sure it look shiny and new              Horse grooming products can be seen on the river bed (left as one man soaps up his horse and washes it in the river (right)         Matching locks!

The food and drink offerings are superlative, and continue to raise the bar for chefs around the globe – California’s cities are among the most culturally important and politically progressive on the planet – and road trip opportunities abound, transporting you from challenging hikes to golden stretch-out sands. All in all, there’s a lot to see – so raise your expectations, glug a coffee, and get exploring.Must eat, must quaffOnce the promised land for farmers, California – with its almost supernaturally fertile landscape – now draws food obsessives from around the globe. There’s an embarrassingly varied selection of excellent locally grown produce, all spectacularly showcased in a farm-to-table dining scene that’s the envy of chefs around the globe. But what makes Californian cuisine such an extreme thrill ride is the cultural fusion – some of the best Japanese, Korean and Mexican food you’ve ever tasted can be found in San Francisco, Los Angeles or San Diego.Cooking and baking are competitive sports in California. Pick a winner in the almond croissant wars between cult San Francisco bakeries Tartine and Miette, and let the taco trucks tough it out for your affections in Los Angeles – start with sweet potato and feta at Guerrilla Tacos then try Guisados’ steak pisados.California’s wine country – all rolling hills and russet-hued vineyards – deserves a special mention for its culinary chops as well, and has tasting rooms made for lingering in. Whether you feast your way around Napa and Sonoma, or opt for the less touristy, yet reliably excellent, wineries and restaurants of Paso Robles and Santa Barbara, every sip and bite will be a highlight.Grapes are not California’s only fermented fruit, however. In San Francisco’s buzzy tiki bar scene, all manner of flavoursome cocktails are available – try a Hetchy Hetchy at Last Rites in the hipster Mission district – and distilled plants get a look-in in San Diego’s laidback North Beach neighbourhood grab a punchy mezcal to wash down the fish tacos at Cantina Mayahuel.Road trippingThe road trip originated in California with good reason open highways and dramatically changing landscapes, generously reward freewheeling travellers. The classic Californian coastal road trip – along the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), from San Francisco south to Los Angeles – should be high on any Californian itinerary. Driving south places you on the right-hand-side of the road for the best coastal views. Big Sur is a highlight of any PCH drive, so take time to linger under canvas in a national park campsite. Alternatively splurge on a luxury lodge like Big Sur’s Post Ranch Inn, where, after a day’s hiking among the redwoods, you can stargaze while you soak your aching muscles. Venture east out of Los Angeles and you’ll be in glamorous Palm Springs in about two hours hit the Kimpton Rowan’s rooftop pool for downtown vibes and mountain views. Explore the quirky desert towns around Joshua Tree, spending a couple of nights at the charmingly old-school Pioneertown Motel. Just a two-minute mosey down the streets of this old western movie is Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s tavern, serving up exemplary barbecue to a killer soundtrack of live acts.The state’s long-established road-trip culture has spawned a range of homegrown cafes and retro roadhouses that make every Californian pitstop an unexpected treat take a booth at the Sugarloaf Cafe in Pinyon Pines to sample dishes from top-drawer New York chef Wesley Barden.North of LA, a drive through Death Valley national park en route to Yosemite brings spectacular contrasts in scenery: the stark, sun-bleached grandeur of Death Valley dramatically segues into the verdant pines, waterfalls and soaring granite cliffs of Yosemite.The great outdoorsCalifornia is almost unfairly blessed with some of the world’s most awe-inspiring and erse outdoor scenery. Of the cluster of well-run national parks, Yosemite is obviously the big-hitter, attracting around 4 million people a year. Even so, it’s possible to get a slice of paradise to yourself, either by getting up early to beat the crowds, venturing farther on longer trails, or visiting in the winter months, when snowshoeing and cross-country skiing replace hiking and mountain-biking. Less than a mile from the national park’s south entrance, family-friendly Tenaya Lodge is a good option for overnight visitors.For many travellers, however, a relative lack of crowds makes a stay at Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks the more relaxed option. The two parks nestle side-by-side in the southern Sierra Nevada, east of the San Joaquin Valley, and it’s worth camping for a couple of days to take in the rugged foothills, deep canyons, lush valleys and some of the world’s largest trees. For a desert scenery fix, head to Joshua Tree, where you can hike – the two-hour Ryan Mountain trail is the park’s most rewarding – bike and climb.Beyond the national parks, Californian cities take getting outside seriously. Los Angeles’s Runyon Canyon offers a respite for city-weary Angelenos, and the city’s hip eastern suburbs of Silver Lake, Echo Park and Los Feliz are well-served by Elysian Park. But San Francisco takes the crown as a city that offers the best of both worlds: the cultural heft of a financial powerhouse just a 20-minute bike ride from rolling hills, soaring redwoods and vast beaches. Cycling over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito is one of the most memorable urban bike rides in the world.Culture, art and designLos Angeles and San Francisco possess very different characters, but both lay claim to serious cultural clout – particularly in terms of popular culture.Synonymous with the beat poets, jazz, and alternative rock, San Francisco also possesses a fiercely progressive spirit, having nurtured the 1960s counterculture movement and pushed LGBTQ rights to the fore in the 1970s and 80s. Today, culture lovers will enjoy wandering the murals of the Mission district as much as marvelling at the Louise Bourgeois room at SFMOMA (sfmoma.org). The Cartoon Art Museum near Fisherman’s Wharf, one of the quirkiest art museums in San Francisco, rekindles childhood obsessions daily (except Wednesdays).Los Angeles has hugely upped its cultural and architectural credentials in recent years, with a cluster of Frank Gehry-designed buildings, such as the Walt Disney Concert Hall, and Liz Diller’s Broad museum of contemporary art, that have transformed downtown Los Angeles into a cultural heavyweight.Beyond the big cities, the state still has much to offer in the way of culture, with plenty of independent galleries, and a supportive scene for local designers, artists and makers. Big Sur’s Henry Miller Memorial Library plays host to exhibitions and events, and the modernist mecca of the Architecture Design Center in Palm Springs showcases photography, architecture and design.The state is firmly on every touring musician’s itinerary too, and is a great place to catch emerging bands at revamped golden age theatres and battered-but-beloved beach town e bars – drop in at The Catalyst in Santa Cruz or Harlow’s in Sacramento to catch established acts and emerging talents.Beach vibesThe Californian coast has been rendered in our imagination through the lyrics of the Beach Boys, the novels of John Steinbeck, and films as varied as Point Break and Rebel Without a Cause, but nothing prepares travellers for just how fundamental beach culture is to Californians. Cycle the promenade between Los Angeles’s Santa Monica and Venice Beach and you’ll see all of life here, from wealthy retirees walking their poodles to gymnasts performing tricks on the outdoor bars and hoops, picnicking families, and Venice’s new tech community catching a few waves before heading to work at Google. Staying in a 1920s-styled bungalow at the Fairmont Miramar Santa Monica is the most starry way to do a seaside stopover LA-style.San Diego, a couple of hours south of LA (and easily reached by either rail or car) is a particularly beach-obsessed city, and a great place to linger on the sands, either at chichi La Jolla Cove Beach or at local surfer hangout Pacific Beach.North of Los Angeles, Pismo Beach is spectacularly beautiful and surrounded by wineries, and as you venture farther north, the scenery only gets more rugged and dramatic. Big Sur is a highlight for visitors, a beach community that has become a refuge for bohemians, solace-seeking celebrities, artists and writers since the likes of Jack Kerouac called it home in the 1950s.For many visitors, Santa Cruz is an unexpected delight, a surf- and music-loving town (spookily captured in cult movie The Lost Boys) that’s a great place to linger for a few days. Wipeout on a wave or two, then visit one of the city’s distilleries – head to Venus Spirits to try their award-winning gin – or breweries to dull the pain.Lovers of coastal scenery should also venture north of San Francisco to explore Point Reyes national seashore walk the Chimney Rock trail, eat oysters from roadside shacks, and feast on artisan cheese at the local cult favourite Cowgirl Creamery.California dreaming?

The rapper welcomed the results, telling the winning pair: “A lot of talented people don’t fulfil their potential, they are so talented but they sit on it. I call it the beautiful shame. But you guys have the confidence to write, to do something about it, and that’s amazing.”Radojevic, whose poems draw from “the joys, the confusions and the moments of sadness behind having one’s history scattered around the globe, and the way in which your identity is always worn on your skin, whether you like or not”, said that winning the award “has shown me that people can connect with the story I have to tell … It has given me a platform for my voice to be heard in a way that I have never before experienced.”Zayyan, who was born to a Nigerian father and Pakistani mother, said that she had entered the competition knowing very little about publishing, and that the award had shown her “that opportunities to have your work recognised really do exist … I am so grateful – and so excited – to have been given the opportunity to tell a story that I have wanted to tell for a long time.” Her novel brings together the stories of Sameer, the son of penniless refugees who graduates from Cambridge and works for a City firm, and Hasan, whose family moved to Uganda from India and whose business now s multiple locations in Uganda.More than 1,200 submissions were received for the award, which sets out to find “the stories that aren’t being heard”. According to the poet Kayo Chigonyi, who was on the judging panel alongside Stormzy, “reading for the prize felt like being given a vision of the future. There was innovation among these entries as well as a very welcome collapsing of received notions of literariness,” he said.Also on the panel were the writer Yrsa Daley-Ward, the writer and agent Nikesh Shukla of the Good Literary Agency and Susan Sandon, MD of Penguin Random House UK. The winners will receive representation from the Good Literary Agency and a publishing contract with #Merky Books, Stormzy’s imprint at Penguin Random House.#Merky Books has already published Stormzy’s own “story so far”, Rise Up, with its second book, Taking Up Space: The Black Girls’ Manifesto for Change by Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi out on 27 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ebbb76f8cb37c7b39ea9187c60747d1328455fd/0_119_3172_1903/master/3172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c900c10caa7e0065eea44e33020fc42a","title":"ford to close bridgend factory in september 2020","story":"Major blow to UK car industry as US company confirms closure, with loss of 1,700 jobs Ford has confirmed that it will close its Bridgend engine plant in September 2020 with the loss of 1,700 jobs, in the latest blow to the embattled British car industry.Workers at the plant were informed on Thursday morning about the decision, which is a major setback for the south Wales economy and an automotive sector bracing for the impact of Brexit.Ford blamed the closure on the imminent end to a contract for engine production for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) as well as a global decline in demand for the Ford engines made in Bridgend. The news comes in the wake of thousands of UK job cuts announced this year by Honda and JLR.Stuart Rowley, the president of Ford in Europe, said the closure was prompted by the US carmaker’s global cost-cutting drive, including about 550 white-collar job cuts announced in the UK last month. However, he added that Bridgend was more expensive than other plants building the same engine because it only had demand for less than a fifth of the 700,000 engines it produced in its peak years.He said: “Changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead.”Production of Ford’s 1.5 litre Dragon engines will cease in February, followed by the end of production for JLR in September 2020. The closure will cost Ford $650m (£512m) in redundancy and pension payments.Ford has three factories in the UK, the others being a plant in Dagenham, east London, which produces diesel engines for vans, and a gearbox plant in Halewood, on the outskirts of Liverpool. Rowley said the remaining two sites – which employ a total of 2,100 people – have a “very firm future” and that there were no plans for further job cuts at either.Rowley renewed Ford’s warnings that it would have to carry out a further review of its operations – including the possibility of closing more British factories – in the case of a no-deal Brexit. However, he insisted that Brexit was not a factor in the decision to close Bridgend.“This action has nothing to do with Brexit,” he said. “If Brexit had never happened would it have been a different decision? The answer to that is no.”Ford received some interest in taking over Bridgend, including from Ineos, the chemicals company owned by the billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, which is planning to manufacture a new off-road vehicle. However, those plans did not come through and Rowley said the plant was not a contender for much-hoped-for investment in battery assembly because of its distance from Ford’s car assembly factories.Ford is only the latest in a string of international carmakers to reduce their UK operations this year. Honda announced in February that it planned to shut its Swindon plant in 2021, with the loss of 3,500 jobs, and Nissan has reversed its decision to build the new X-Trail vehicle at its Sunderland plant. JLR, the Indian-owned company that runs Britain’s largest carmaking operation, is also cutting thousands of jobs.The Bridgend closure will leave Toyota’s Deeside engine plant and Aston Martin Lagonda’s new St Athan plant as the only major carmaking locations in Wales.Jeff Beck, a regional organiser at the GMB trade union, which represents workers at the plant, said the decision was “a real hammer blow for the Welsh economy and the community in Bridgend”. Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, said Ford had betrayed workers in “an act of gross industrial sabotage”.The plant indirectly supports the jobs of another 12,000 people in the local economy, according to estimates supplied to Madeleine Moon, the Labour MP for Bridgend. Ford will repay £11m in state aid given to it by the Welsh government to support the plant.While Ford insisted Brexit was not a factor, Moon said company executives had been outspoken in their warnings over the viability of the Bridgend operations to government ministers – even when offered similar support to the £61m awarded to Nissan.“They made it absolutely clear that a hard Brexit without a customs union and the single market would make it impossible to operate here,” she said.“You can’t keep throwing money at companies to get them to stay.”The Ford plant has manufactured petrol engines since 1980 and supplies the company’s factories across Europe.The company is undergoing a round of steep cost-cutting around the world. It announced widespread job losses across its European operations in January and said it would consider closing plants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce8f644edd2bd5cbd32a61fce9fa60d0380d43f4/0_9_1369_822/master/1369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd47f52071618032711504601330a3b0","title":"have you been affected by what has happened with the neil woodford fund","story":"We’d like to hear from those who have invested in Neil Woodford’s fund and are affected by his decisionThe UK’s most renowned fund manager, Neil Woodford, has blocked investors from pulling money from his flagship fund.

Neil Woodford looked to be in shock in his brief video message to his dwindling band of followers earlier this week, but he needs to wake up. You can’t expect to charge management fees at the old rate while the customers are not able to redeem their investments.But Morgan, if she intends to e deeper into this saga, needs to be clear on what her committee should investigate. Woodfood’s hubristic stock-picking approach in the past two years does not seem worthy of much parliamentary time. Nor does the mere act of closing the funds temporarily that’s within the rules and is designed to protect investors from a fire sale of assets (the pace of Woodford’s current selling looks scorching anyway).Sharon White was only ever a long-shot bet to be the next governor of the Bank of England, but punters could probably have named their price on her being chosen as chairman of the John Lewis Partnership.The outgoing chief executive of media regulator Ofcom has no retail background and her experience at the sharp end of the money-making game amounts to 18 months as a non-executive director at Barratt Developments, the housebuilder. “I readily recognise that Sharon is not the conventional retail choice,” the current chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, said. You bet.John Lewis is also making this appointment – a £1m-a-year executive role, so not ceremonial – during stormy weather in retail-land. The employee-owned business has suffered a downwards lurch in profits and has slashed partners’ bonuses. A risky hire, then? Well, yes, obviously. But do not call it illogical.When White was appointed to Ofcom five years ago, industry executives similarly muttered that she had no experience in regulation or media they probably expected to run rings around her. Instead, half a decade later, Ofcom looks in stronger shape that it has been for years. White’s primary battle was with BT over Openreach, the broadband ision, and she achieved roughly what she wanted by threatening, but not ultimately demanding, a full breakup. BT has picked up the pace on fibre investment and we have been spared the unnecessary tedium of a fight in the courts. From a regulatory point of view, that’s a decent outcome.Ofcom has 900 employees, whereas John Lewis has 84,000, so White will have to learn on the job. She can only be judged by results, but she could be a shrewd hire.Frank Field MP got there in the end. The one-week delay in the vote on Arcadia’s restructuring plan has created some time to look closely at the pension aspect of the plan, and Sir Philip Green’s former tormentor intends to use it. He wants the Pensions Regulator to explain why it is happy with a structure that would see Lady Green contribute £100m over three years and Arcadia give the pension fund security more than £210m of assets.Those numbers are large, but so is the deficit – £750m or so on one accounting measure.

Some results are freaks – the Liberals’ surprise win in Orpington in 1962 did not herald a great revival for the party, nor was Shirley Williams’s spectacular Crosby win in 1981 a harbinger of SDP mould-breaking. But sometimes byelections do signal seismic change.Today Peterborough bids to crack open the old two-party hegemony, with the new Brexit party favourite to win. Labour may yet hang on, its campaign benefiting from an experienced get-out-our-vote local team. But even if Nigel Farage just misses, he can still claim an extraordinary result, rattling the Tories deeper into no-deal extremism. Glumly resigned to their coming humiliation, the party’s large foolish tendency will persuade themselves that Boris Johnson can magic them out of the slough of despond.Labour is the party standing to lose most if Peterborough slips its grasp. Though its former MP’s prison sentence has some effect, the real struggle is to push Jeremy Corbyn off the fence of Labour’s failed Brexit policy. Win or lose today, watch both sides in Labour leap out to claim victoryloss was due to their favoured policy. The battle is on to reshape Labour policy not just for a referendum but to commit to campaigning vigorously for remain. Another Europe is Possible, Hope not Hate, Best for Britain and others are hitting the phone banks, calling round local parties to back a strong referendum-and-remain motion for the party conference.Labour can’t afford to wait for its party conference in late September – and all but the knot of Lexiters surrounding Corbyn know it. The shock of the disastrous European election results is turning MPs towards the only direction that can rescue the party. Jenny Chapman, shadow minister for exiting the EU and MP for leave-voting Darlington, is a bellwether. Once an adamant anti-referendumite, on Wednesday she strongly backed another public vote on the BBC’s Politics Live. “Take the bull by the horns now” she said. “I don’t see any other way than a referendum.”Other MPs equally conflicted by their constituents’ Brexit stance include Karl Turner, whose Hull East was a strong leave-voting seat. But he too has now switched to remain. “Yes, I would lose a few thousand votes but not enough to lose the seat. This policy is a disaster and I need to do what’s best for my constituents: I’m not their delegate.” He sees other Labour MPs now realising that even in leave seats, the loss of remain votes will do far more damage, and the very real prospect of a Tory no deal is terrifying. John McDonnell, on Wednesday night’s Peston programme, was even clearer than before: “Any deal has to be put to a public vote.”How long can Labour resist coming out unequivocally for remain? After a week of Trump and D-day, next week Corbyn speaks to the PLP and the shadow cabinet meets, where there will be an urgent push to topple Corbyn off the fence, in order to summon back voters lost by obstinately pursuing a policy the great majority reject. Shadow cabinet members warn that Labour needs a strong clear pro-remain policy now, before the Tories select their new leader next month. September is far too late, but the membership will force the policy change: better by far Corbyn is seen to make that leap himself.Here’s the curiosity in Labour’s position: all his life Corbyn followed the Bennite belief in the supremacy of party members to determine policy, yet now he defies them. Doubly odd is that he owes the security of his tenure entirely to that same membership who keep him there, despite his refusal to listen to them. Local parties report his perversely inert stance on Brexit is driving members away those not tearing up their cards will show up as non-renewers. Michael Chessum, national organiser of the motion to conference, says: “It is time for Labour to make a final and complete shift towards backing a public vote and opposing Brexit. The alternative is that the electoral coalition behind Corbyn’s Labour falls apart.”The Corbyn coterie tries to dismiss all critics as phantom “Blairites”, but this is the party’s left rebelling. They rightly see this as a fundamental culture war with the Trumpite alt-right, and demand “an agenda of internationalism, defending free movement and fighting for radical change rather than pandering to the nationalist right”. They see the CorbynLen McCluskey stand aligning with the right, clinging to an imaginary ideal of the perfect Labour voter as “old, white, male, with a regional accent” as if every other working Labour supporter doesn’t count. But they do, as poll after poll shows. Win or lose in Peterborough today, this is the battle not just for the heart of Labour but for its very survival. As one leader in the charge for the referendum-and-remain motion says: “Jeremy is MIA.”When the Tories select a no-dealer, the country needs a powerful opposition to mobilise every vote against a reckless new prime minister willing to drag the country out of Europe without public consent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3af1ade32703c4b9e794a954c2251573b6f0c7ee/0_0_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f13f646953c6f787c1e356ab00c0610d","title":"theresa may dominic raab no deal","story":"When Dominic Raab will not rule out proroguing parliament to force a no deal through, we have entered a dark placeEverything changes, but some things stay the same.To watch the Queen addressing elderly survivors of D-day this week was to be reminded that the point of monarchy is constancy. All hell might be breaking loose around her, but there she is, dressed as she has dressed for half a century and choosing her words with the care she always has. She has seen enough prime ministers come and go that one more presumably doesn’t make much difference. The rest of us, however, cannot afford to be quite so sanguine.Friday marks Theresa May’s formal relinquishing of the Tory leadership, which increasingly looks not so much like passing on the torch as dropping a burned-out sparkler and accidentally starting a grass fire. It will be almost the end of July before her replacement is foisted on the nation by those Conservative party members entitled to vote and, already, moves are reportedly underfoot to avoid the new leader facing a confidence vote in parliament. The will of the people has given way to the will of a few hundred thousand people who may barely represent Tory voters, let alone the nation. An awkward silence, meanwhile, shrouds the question of this unelected future prime minister’s democratic mandate.There is an extraordinary moment in Jeremy Hunt’s new campaign video where the wannabe leader suggests Tories should choose him because otherwise there might have to be a general election that Jeremy Corbyn could win. “Vote for me, and hide from the voters” is a dismal slogan but less shocking than Dominic Raab’s refusal to rule out hiding from parliament too this week he declined to reject hard Brexiters’ crazed pet idea that parliament be prorogued, or in effect suspended from sitting, to ram a no-deal Brexit through.It would be government by carjack, almost certainly impossible in practice. But when a prospective leader can’t bring himself to say that this is the stuff of 16th-century monarchs not modern leaders, we slide towards that dark place where people who can’t get what they want by democratic means begin weighing alternatives.Without wanting to be melodramatic, it’s in weeks like this that you realise how little stands between us and a prime minister of genuinely malign intent how many democratic norms rely on an understanding that those in power will do the decent thing, or that the Queen will mysteriously intervene at the last minute. The assumption is that party leaders will always voluntarily seek mandates because otherwise voters would punish their high-handedness at the next election. But when the Brexit party didn’t even bother producing a manifesto, that most basic contract between politicians and the people, it feels unwise to take much for granted.These are shark-infested constitutional waters, yet we’re sailing into them rudderless. May remains prime minister in theory, but government is on hold pending new management. The home, health and foreign secretaries among others are all in campaign mode, and anything the government does for the next six weeks will invariably get sucked into the vortex there are already rumblings about the appropriateness of publishing updates on no-deal planning during the contest. When the EU extended our deadline for leaving, Britain was warned not to waste that time. Yet the only party leader who has used it to the full is Nigel Farage.Votes in Peterborough are not yet counted. But whether the Brexit party gets its byelection scalp or not, the sidelining of the Tories in a marginal seat they held until recently has sent shudders through the party. There is no route to a majority for a Conservative party that can’t win a marginal seat even when its previous Labour MP goes to prison. But Farage’s party has been mischievously portraying the byelection as a fight between it and the Liberal Democrats, as if the two main parties barely existed just hard leave versus hard remain, nothing but tumbleweed between. Playing up the Lib Dems in a Labour-held seat is, of course, a cynical ruse to split the remain vote by sowing confusion about where it should go. But as ruses go it’s clever, tapping into a profound exasperation with the big parties that has left smaller ones calling the tune.Or more precisely, some of the smaller ones. If politics is now breaking open, then it’s not in the way a handful of Tory and Labour MPs envisaged when they abandoned their old parties to form Change UK, which this week duly split. They wanted to create something new but seem instead to have helped to revive something old, with the Lib Dems enjoying a popularity not seen since the days of Cleggmania as they reap the rewards of having fought Brexit before it was popular.But if the Tiggers failed to establish themselves as the answer, they were right to identify a problem with their respective old parties, and until Labour and the Conservatives have dealt with the underlying causes of their toxicity they have nothing to feel smug about. If the rise of the Brexit party continues, the change now coming might be the one some have long warned about: a vacancy opening up not in the centre ground of politics but the bigger space occupied by socially conservative voters, frustrated that their views have long been pushed to the fringe.Polling voters on how they might react to new party leaders is notoriously unreliable because people struggle to guess how they’ll feel in the future about someone they don’t yet know. But with those caveats, polling leaked to the Boris Johnson-supporting Guido Fawkes site this week was instructive. Of five Tory candidates tested, Johnson emerged as most likely to stop votes haemorrhaging to the Brexit party, which is why he’s the frontrunner. But none of them won over enough Labour and Lib Dem supporters to cobble together a majority, with voters scattering in at least four directions. This is the stuff of nightmare coalitions and Faustian bargains. No wonder Tory MPs want to put an election off for as long as possible, in the vague hope something else turns up.In hyper-volatile times, it’s not completely implausible that something might. Small parties generally thrive when bigger ones screw up, which makes them vulnerable to bigger ones getting their act together again. If Corbyn finally settled on a Brexit position capable of scraping his own lost voters back off the Lib Dems, things could turn upside down overnight. If the momentum created by last month’s election upsets peters out over the summer, and a new Tory leader manages to steal the limelight for something other than Brexit, then the smaller parties might once again struggle to get noticed their Achilles heel is supporters forgetting about them, or concluding that they’re a wasted vote.But the deeper the Tories descend into a bidding war over a no deal, the more they make everything about Farage, and the stronger he consequently grows. If that is where this leadership contest is ultimately leading, then they shouldn’t be surprised when the people demand a say on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20748b664ae5217c63567a5079aca71a578a9730/0_362_1920_2112/master/1920.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc9f0cd0705d1e98bffa0ddad9b2bc2e 660w","title":"70s bond girl caroline munro i loved roger moore his knitwear was really classy","story":"She spent her career being chased by vampires, 007 and David Hasselhoff. And she also found time to sing with Cream and Gary Numan. Was it all as much fun as it looked?One day, 50 years ago, a solicitor walking to work through Waterloo station in London noticed a 30ft-tall woman. She was dressed in an unzipped scuba top and was brandishing a knife drawn from a scabbard strapped to her bare thigh. It was his daughter. “Dad knew I was going to be the Lamb’s Navy Rum girl, but not that I would be on a billboard,” says Caroline Munro. “He said it was a bit of a shock.”Over the next decade, Munro’s parents got used to seeing their daughter writ large and wearing smalls. There she was on the cover of the Music for Pleasure Hot Hits 11 album, practising archery in a bikini and knee-high suede boots. There she was with Peter Cushing, exploring the underworld, in minimal clothes but lots of eyeliner, in At the Earth’s Core (1976). And there she was opposite David Hasselhoff in the 1978 movie Starcrash, her limbs swathed, but only in cellophane.For a decade, she remained the face of Lamb’s Navy Rum. “Join the Lamb’s Navy,” went the slogan. “It’s where the action is.” The Office for National Statistics holds no data on whether naval recruitment rose during the 1970s, but intuitively it seems likely that squads of would-be sailors signed up after seeing Munro wearing a naval jacket with epaulettes and little else.“I loved the job,” she says. “We had shoots in all kinds of exotic places.” And Cornwall. “I remember being in the sea in the winter. Not a good day.”Didn’t her religious parents object to their only child getting into the scanty end of modelling? “I think they were pleased that I found a career that I enjoyed. I had dyslexia which, for a long time, really undermined my confidence. I think my mother hoped I would become a window dresser.”The unexpected path first opened up in the mid-60s when a photo a friend took of her when she was 16 won the Evening News’s Face of the Year competition, which was judged by David Bailey. She doesn’t remember the snap, other than that she was freckly. Modelling gigs came quickly, including a shoot for American Vogue in which, she says, she had to sit in the sea off Malta modelling knitwear.I am agog at the news: Roger Moore – her co-star in The Spy Who Loved Me – also started off as a knitwear model. “Oh that’s right! I knew there was something about him I liked. His knitwear was very classic, really.”In 1967, Munro, who had sung in her church choir, released her first single, a breathy ditty called Tar and Cement, recorded at Abbey Road. Her backing band was Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, better known as Cream, alongside the future Yes guitarist Steve Howe. She remembers Baker driving her up the Mall in an open-topped Jaguar to the photoshoot an image in keeping with the Austin Powers-ish tang of her life at this time. But it’s the B-side, This Sporting Life, the 70-year-old Munro sings to me today over coffee. “‘I’m getting tired of hanging around  Think I will marry and settle down  Because this old night life  This old sport life  Is killing me.’ I was only 16, just out of convent school when I sang that. It was ridiculous, really. I didn’t know anything about living a sporting life.”Earlier that year, her dad had dropped her off at Elstree studios to play one of Woody Allen’s gun-toting guards in the James Bond spoof Casino Royale. “We all wore chain mail dresses and gladiator boots. My mum was thrilled. She loved Woody Allen’s work.”Her first speaking role came in the 1969 comedy western A Talent for Loving. “They wanted someone who looked Mexican. I had to speak with an accent.” What was the story? “My father has to marry me off because of the family curse – we love too much.” Essentially, the plot demanded that Munro’s character be cured of her ancestral nymphomania. “My love interest in the film was Derek Nimmo.” You mean Just a Minute’s Derek Nimmo? “That’s him. Lovely Derek!”But Munro’s big acting break, in 1972, was thanks not to such screen work but her continuing efforts for booze and seamen. James Carreras, head of Hammer horror, had also been transfixed by a Lamb’s Navy Rum billboard. As a result, she became – like Ingrid Pitt, Joanna Lumley, Kate O’Mara – fated to spend aeons being nibbled by gaunt men with false teeth.She signed a contract at the studio and starred with Christopher Lee in Dracula AD 1972. “That was when I realised I wanted to be an actor. It made me get serious and study for it.” In Captain Kronos – Vampire Hunter, she played the barefoot Gypsy girl Carla whom the eponymous captain saves from bloodsuckers. It has some fabulous dialogue. “What he doesn’t know about vampirism,” says the captain of his hunchbacked assistant, “wouldn’t fill a fly’s codpiece.”“They were planning a sequel, but it never happened,” says Munro, sadly.Despite a recent flip-flop-related fall that wrenched two fingers and left some nasty bruising on her face, Munro remains glamorous. Presumably she has been the victim of endless unwanted sexual advances? Again, her story is one of confounding sunniness. “I wasn’t! Everybody behaved very well to me. I didn’t expect anything else. I think it’s terrible what these women have had to deal with. I was treated with great courtesy throughout my career, though.”There was one near-incident, in fact, involving a Hollywood producer who had rented the whole top floor of Claridge’s hotel in London. “I walked in, and I ran out.” Why? “He was with his girlfriend, but there was something wrong. Something I didn’t care for. I just made my excuses and ran. It was an instinctive thing.” She declines to elaborate, but mentions the film she was there to discuss: Two for the Road, the Stanley Donen-directed romcom starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney.In 1977, the producer of the Bond films, Cubby Broccoli, cast her as Bond villainess Naomi in The Spy Who Loved Me. In one scene, Roger Moore’s Bond arrives in Sardinia, posing as a marine biologist. Naomi, sporting a bikini and diaphanous peignoir, sashays to her boat, as Bond comments: “What a handsome craft – such lovely lines.”Later, Naomi is tasked with killing Bond and his accomplice, which she attempts to do from her helicopter, shooting at the Lotus Esprit while Bond negotiates Sardinian corniches. Then 007 turns the tables: his car, souped up by Q, becomes a submarine, which fires a deadly rocket at Naomi’s chopper. What do you remember of the shoot? “Well, I didn’t fly the helicopter. That was a lovely stunt man in a black wig.” She filmed her scenes sitting in a helicopter in London.No matter. Munro became a Bond girl. She talks enthusiastically about sharing memories with fellow members of that elite club on the festival circuit. “The roles are getting better for women. When you think about it, the most iconic Bond girl is Judi Dench.”But after romping with Hasselhoff in space in Starcrash, whose spin-off merchandise includes a collectible Caroline Munro ray-gun-waving action figure (do leather bikini bottoms feature holsters as standard? Sure, why not?), she changed course. In the slasher film Maniac she played a photographer romanced by a New York serial killer who scalps his victims. It remains something of a cult favourite, although at the time it attracted some interest from some British police forces as a putative video nasty.Munro’s musical endeavours also continued: in 1985, she recorded a single, Pump Me Up, with Gary Numan, a piece of electropop very much of its time. “It was a big hit in Italy,” she says. She would still like to make more records – country rock, would be her preference, she says, before cautioning: “You haven’t heard how out of tune I sound on some of my records. I’m not exactly Aretha Franklin.”Her career could have taken a different turn had she moved to the US. “I went there to audition for some daytime soap in the 80s: Young and Restless or The Bold and the Beautiful – I forget which. But my parents were ageing by then and I didn’t want to leave them.” Her loyalty to them also meant she turned down the role of comic book heroine Vampirella, for whom she would have to shed her clothes entirely.Instead, she became a hostess on Ted Rogers’ Yorkshire TV gameshow 3-2-1 and had two daughters, Georgina and Iona, with her second husband, the writer-director George Dugdale who directed her in Slaughter High.The journalist and broadcaster Samira Ahmed once wrote an article about how being Munro’s neighbour made her re-evaluate her loathing of 70s objectification. “I saw her almost every day those unmistakeable exotic eyes on a middle-aged mum: in the supermarket, walking her daughter to school, signing autographs on the street for bedazzled men. Perhaps she serves to remind us to be wary of sweeping judgments about decades and attitudes. For all the horrors that lurked within the 70s, many who were there did, after all, make their peace with it and grow up just fine.”Ahmed is right: Munro made her peace and grew up fine. She is still wedded to 1970s horror, last year appearing in The House of the Gorgon, a crowdfunded Hammer homage movie directed by and starring a 23-year-old Texan, which was shot in six days. And she is also, with no apparent clash, “all for female empowerment” and recently went on the Women’s March in London. “I love the fact that women speak out now,” she says, even if she – remarkably – never needed to. “I never expected to become an actor. I’ve loved every minute of it and I’ve been very lucky.”The Spy Who Loved me is screened at the Regent Street Cinema, London, on 16 June, followed by a Q\u0026ampA with Munro"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bea0bcc959c22271476ca2dce243350eb92104d7/0_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bfb8d63c30aceb55e71f51834973d97","title":"liam gallagher as it was review music documentary oasis","story":"The charismatic swagger remains, but this disarming portrait of the former Oasis singer reveals a newfound humilityBros raised the candid rockumentary bar, and it falls to Liam Gallagher to respond: strange days indeed. This disarming portrait of pop’s pre-eminent monobrow picks up where Supersonic (2016) left off, with the sundering of the brothers Gallagher amid Oasis’s toxic 2009 tour. As It Was follows Liam through a challenging transition period.Their familiar braggadocio is still on display – within five minutes, the film’s subject can be heard declaring “I know how great I am” – but the opening half-hour describes the failures of multiple projects close to the singer’s heart: rebound band Beady Eye, fashion line Pretty Green, the dissolution of his marriage to Nicole Appleton. A man installed as a rock god in his 20s is suddenly confronted by a question familiar to mere mortals of a certain age: what next?The answer: an arguably long-overdue process of growing up. Directors Charlie Lightening and Gavin Fitzgerald offer some evidence of rock excess: video diaries from Palma (where Gallagher doused his demons with grog), an anecdote involving a confusion of psoriasis with cocaine that leaves Jo Whiley squirming. Yet much of these 85 minutes could be retitled The Re-Education of Liam Gallagher. He starts writing songs and he finds an ally in unflappable partner-manager Debbie Gwyther. This quest for maturity may have been conceived as a two-fingered riposte to those who said he’d be dead by 40, but our kid sets about it with the same unvarnished honesty that makes him good Twitter value.Though one very sharp montage nails the bewilderment of touring, much of As It Was resembles any other rock doc with an access-all-areas pass, and it has one of those contractual-obligation climaxes designed to dovetail with the wider promotion of new material. It benefits considerably from a subject who’s bolstered his charisma with a newfound humility, an awareness of the world beyond the Roman nose.Gallagher remains a showman what the directors reveal is the musician having to work doubly hard to win back those fans he mugged off a decade ago. Odds are this story has a third act. As Gwyther observes, re Liam-and-Noel: “He misses him. He’s his brother.” Meanwhile, even for those of us who voted Blur in the Britpop referendum of 1995, these count as heartening developments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/843457421f7d520fc7afc0189b70ec627644fd1a/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0a41b18279de7d485c3a526fe784f95","title":"womens world cup 2019 hopes expectations","story":"The most anticipated Women’s World Cup in history is just days away.

Now Bronze is a focal point. The 27-year-old is a two-times Champions League winner, a treble winner with Lyon, and is Neville’s pick as the best female player in the world. Her stock could hardly be higher.And the World Cup in Canada was where it all began. “We were successful and I scored a couple of goals and I think my football life changed overnight,” she says. “People knew my name and who I was, and I had a target on my back when I was playing, but it was something I enjoyed and always wanted.“I played with the likes of Kelly Smith, Rachel Yankey and Fara Williams – all these great players. Everybody knew who they were and I was turning into one of these girls who were always my heroes.”She no longer feels there is a target on her back, the load lightened at club and international level by the quality of the players around her. “At Lyon there’s 20 other superstars there – I’m not the best player there, I’m not the best player at England,” she says. “There’s players who are brilliant as well, so there’s shared responsibility and pressure. That’s the strength in the squad right now.”As the best right-back in the world and playing in arguably its best club team, she is hugely valuable to the England manager. So much so that with the absence of the injured Jordan Nobbs he has experimented with Bronze in midfield. Why? Because she embodies her second middle name, her mum’s maiden name: Tough.“Every day people are coming in to talk about the World Cup, to talk to myself or the Japanese, or whoever about it, and our president at Lyon talks about it all the time. It’s in the media, in the papers, most weeks.”France have underperformed on the biggest stages but there is a feeling that everything is clicking for them. “One of them said to me that if they win she will retire, and she’s one of the best players in the world, Amandine Henry,” Bronze says. “They are absolutely buzzing, the whole country is behind them. For me, they are probably the most talented team in terms of ability. They have some of the best players in the world and a lot of them – not just one or two. They are a top team and the nation will be behind them.”One of her clubmates will be missing, though. Ada Hegerberg, scorer of a hat-trick in the Champions League final and the Ballon d’Or winner, has chosen not to represent Norway, a disagreement with the football federation over opportunities for girls domestically and the way the team play at the heart of her bold decision.“She’s set in her ways about what she wants to do,” says Bronze. “The way she speaks and the way she is, she’s a trailblazer and she has a lot of strong opinions on a lot of things, not just in football. She wants to do what she thinks is right and push her country on.“It’s different for me – I’m in a very privileged position and the FA support us in such great ways … The way Ada is, she will change a lot of things in the game whether that’s with Lyon or Norway, or with football or women’s sport in general.”For England the growth of the game domestically has meant even the more inexperienced players are better prepared for a tournament. “It’s not just myself that went into the last tournament with a bit of the unknown,” Bronze says. “A lot of players were like that and in the last four years as women’s football has grown, we’ve grown with it, and the team has grown with it.“No one is lagging behind. They are up to speed people aren’t going to feel the pressure. Everyone is used to the cameras being in front of them – that’s women’s football now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a8e9a0fa8e890877848c32a01fe92a2f0220373/0_59_2177_1306/master/2177.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c4e382b9a9bb7fea0a073f0d883aefe","title":"netherlands england nations league semi final match report","story":"It was an ignominious way for England to lose and, ultimately, their collapse in extra time was probably best summed up by the image of Ross Barkley with his face down in the turf, not wanting to look up and survey the damage after his mistake for the third Dutch goal.Barkley was not the only player wandering round the pitch with the look of a zombie. For John Stones, this was a personal ordeal in keeping with a bittersweet season on the fringes of Manchester city’s success. The records will show it was Kyle Walker’s own-goal that gave the Netherlands their second goal. In reality, it was a fairly dreadful error from Stones that put England in danger, dilly-dalling on the ball with Memphis Depay in close proximity.Depay took the ball off Stones and took aim at Jordan Pickford’s goal. It was a fine save from England’s goalkeeper but the ball was loose and, even with Walker’s renowned pace, the substitute Quincy Promes slid in first to connect with the rebound.The ball went in off the luckless Walker and, unfortunately for Stones, the centre-half was also partly at fault again when Promes added the third goal with 114 minutes on the clock. It was Stones’s pass that put Barkley under pressure, losing the ball and allowing Depay to set up Promes.It was difficult to know which was the more calamitous goal and that made it a tremendous disappointment for Gareth Southgate and his players after they had taken the lead via Marcus Rashford’s first-half penalty and, at 1-1, celebrated what they thought was a potential winner from the substitute Jesse Lingard in the 84th minute, only for it to be ruled out by a marginal VAR offside decision.As has been the case for most of Southgate’s reign, it was a system built on quick, penetrative attackers, overlapping full-backs and an ability to switch seamlessly between different formations rather than relying rigidly on one system. One move, in particular, felt symbolic of the new era: Jadon Sancho dancing through the middle and having the impudence to slip the ball through Matthijs de Ligt’s legs before a beautifully weighted reverse pass to slip Rashford behind the defence. Denzel Dumfries saved the Netherlands with a brilliant tackle but it was still a fine snapshot of how Southgate wants England to attack, with vibrancy, wit and the courage to try new things.England also had the backing of three-quarters of the stadium and enough support to make it resemble a home game. There were only two corners of Vitória’s ground populated by the garish shirts of Oranje, which was probably an indication about how the Dutch remain aloof to this competition. Otherwise it was an English invasion and when they are not getting some strange kick out of their unpleasantness – exhibit A: whistling and singing through the Dutch national anthem – the people who follow Southgate’s team to these unthreatening destinations are capable of making a heck of a din.The volume was certainly turned up just after the half-hour mark when Marten de Roon turned the ball back to De Ligt in the Dutch penalty area. De Ligt’s status as one of the outstanding young players in European football is expected to lead to a transfer to Barcelona this summer. On this occasion he was badly at fault, taking his eye off the ball and allowing it to run under his foot.Rashford was quick to anticipate the danger and De Ligt, in his desperation to save himself, was a split second behind as he lunged in with the attempted tackle. He missed the ball, took out the player and Rashford, an increasingly confident penalty-taker, composed himself to aim the kick beyond Jasper Cillessen.Unfortunately for Rashford, he was hurt in the challenge from Dumfries that denied him a second goal. It was no surprise that he did not come back out for the second half, meaning the introduction of Harry Kane sooner than Southgate would have liked.Southgate did not start with any of his players from Liverpool and Tottenham. That meant Raheem Sterling taking over as captain – for the first half anyway – from Kane on the evening the Manchester City player won his 50th cap.Fabian Delph, who has not started a Premier League game for City since Boxing Day, was flanked by Declan Rice and Barkley in midfield, with Sterling and Sancho in the attacking wide positions and Rashford operating through the middle. Walker and Ben Chilwell both had the licence to push forward from their full-back positions and, in those moments, Rice tended to drop in between Stones and Harry Maguire, the two centre-halves.There were still imperfections, such as the moment early in the second half when Walker tried to run the ball out of defence, lost possession to Depay and was grateful Pickford was alert to keep out the shot.Chilwell was fortunate a few minutes earlier not to give away a penalty for a mistimed challenge on Steven Bergwijn and, late in the first half, De Ligt had a headed opportunity to change the complexion of his evening.Sancho should probably have done better with an unchallenged header from Delph’s cross but, as the game reached the hour mark, Ronald Koeman’s team were having a lot of the ball in encouraging positions. It paid off when De Ligt equalised with a powerful header."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06d78aad97a80a432ef3151749385cefe93a9ca3/165_20_3067_1840/master/3067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbc1c1fc73b72b2455ec6d27284284a5","title":"netherlands v england nations league semi final live","story":"Defensive mistakes cost England dear as the Dutch advanced to a Sunday showdown with PortugalDaniel Taylor was our man at the Estádio D Afonso Henriques in Guimarães. Here’s his verdict on another night of semi-final despair for the Three Lions.Sterling makes a strong point. If you’d told anyone this time last year that England would contest both the World Cup semi-finals and the Nations League semi-finals within 11 months, you’d have been told to put the pipe down. But this England team are now operating at the business end of big tournaments. There’s still plenty of work to do, and while tonight’s defensive calamities will get all the attention, the lack of midfield control needs addressing as well. But they’re heading in the right direction, and there are worse places to finish than third or fourth, right? Or maybe it’s still too raw for talk like this. “Not bothered anyway,” sniffs Christopher Lee. “Stupid tinpot made-up trophy anyway. Not even bothered. YOU’RE CRYING.”A word with a reflective Raheem Sterling. “I thought at times we soaked up pressure really well. Towards the end of the second half I thought we were the better team. But if you make silly mistakes at this level you get punished for it. VAR is one of those things. One day it might help us, but today it didn’t. We’re disappointed. They got their pressing right on the night, and we made a few mistakes. We tried but it didn’t work. We have to keep trying. It just wasn’t to be. I think we’ve still made progress to get to this stage, and it’s all about kicking on now, and trying to achieve the last bit.”England’s 53-year wait for a major final will go on. The Netherlands will play Portugal in the very first Nations League final! England face another third-place match, this time against Switzerland.120 min: Depay nearly latches onto a loose ball down the right, but Pickford is out quickly to gather on the edge of his box. A 4-1 scoreline would have been harsh on England.119 min: The English fans have been the noisiest for most of the evening, but now it’s only the Dutch who can be heard. They give it the olés as the oranje ping it around.117 min: Kane has a shot from distance. It’s deflected over for a corner, from which nothing occurs. England’s shoulders collectively slump.116 min: England have been the architect of their own downfall. Depay looks to add to their misery with a shot from 30 yards, but it flies over the bar. It’s not going to matter.Another Dutch goal, another English defensive fiasco. Stones, deep as can be, passes upfield to Barkley, on the edge of his box facing his own goal. A heavy touch allows Depay to scoot off with the ball down the inside-left channel. He draws Pickford, then cuts back for Promes, who lashes into the empty net.113 min: The Netherlands make their final change. De Jong makes his way to the far side of the pitch, because he’s the one being hooked. Strootman comes on in his stead, once he leaves.112 min: Walker slings in a fine cross from the right. Kane’s up in the hope of winning the header, but he’s too eager and bashes into a well-positioned De Ligt. A free kick, and the clock is now England’s sworn enemy.111 min: England have to take chances now, and there are gaps at the back. Holland nearly exploit this state of affairs when Depay screams down the right, but his ball inside, with Wijnaldum free, is too strong for his team-mate.110 min: Alli needlessly drags down De Jong, and Holland take their own sweet time to restart the match. Textbook game management, and very frustrating for England, who have no option but to suck it up.108 min: Kane bustles around the edge of the Dutch box, then turns on a sixpence and bursts down the inside left. He nearly breaks through but De Ligt slides in at the expense of a corner. No great loss, because Henderson’s delivery fails to clear the first man.106 min: Van de Beek is booked for coming straight through the back of Barkley.And we’re off again! England use up their bonus extra-time substitution, going for broke by replacing Declan Rice with Dele Alli.England needed to hear that whistle. They were going nowhere. And they need a goal desperately.103 min: An awful lot of aimless stuff in the middle of the park. This benefits Holland much more than England, the scoreline being what it is.101 min: A free kick for Holland out on the left. Depay fizzes it from a tight angle towards the bottom left. Pickford gathers. England counter through Sterling down the right. He’s sent free but miles offside. The flag doesn’t go up immediately, though, and England’s fans want a penalty as De Ligt bowls Sterling over. But they’re not getting it. Up goes the flag, and that’s that.99 min: Holland have their tails up. A corner on the left. Depay flashes a header goalwards at point-blank range. Pickford saves instinctively, brilliantly. Another corner, which Van Dijk meets with a header that’s going into the bottom left. Kane clears off the line.What a complete farce! Maguire plays the ball back to Stones, who faffs around on the edge of his own box. He’s stripped of possession by Depay, who is clear! Pickford parries the shot magnificently, but the ball breaks left. Promes is getting there ahead of both Pickford and Walker. His attempt to bundle home is going wide left, but he’s knocked the ball against Walker’s outstretched leg, over Pickford and in!95 min: And so Depay takes. But he doesn’t get it anywhere near the top right corner, where he was aiming, and it’s an easy claim for Pickford in the middle of goal.94 min: Stones miscontrols and then hacks De Jong to the floor. A free kick just to the left of the D. Depay fancies it.93 min: Space for Dumfries down the right. He curls into the centre. Van de Beek winds his neck back to head. Stones gets in the road to ert the ball out for a corner. From the set piece, Van Dijk rises highest and plants a header towards the bottom right. Kane clears off the line!91 min: Lingard is quickly scampering down the right, and gets two opportunities to cross. Neither is taken.Here we go again! England get extra time underway. The Netherlands were the better team for most of the second half, but England will take heart at their strong finish to the game. So this is going to be some 30 minutes. Holland swap Bergwijn with Propper.Extra time it is, then! It was always going to happen, wasn’t it? It’s a semi-final. This is how England roll.90 min +6: And now here he is sashaying in from the left and grazing a shot off the top of the crossbar! England yet again so close to the final!90 min +5: England have been much improved since the equaliser, and the introduction of Henderson, who has given them better shape. Sterling has been much more involved.90 min +4: England escape. Maguire is caught napping near the left-hand corner flag, at the edge of his own box. Bergwijn robs him and pulls back for Depay, who leans back and slices the ball high and horribly wide with the goal gaping. For a second, that looked like it.90 min +3: Lingard dribbles hard at the Holland back line. He’s got them retreating. Once he reaches the edge of the box, he opens his body and tries to guide a shot into the bottom right. It’s just wide.90 min +2: A free kick for England out on the left. Chilwell loops it towards the Dutch box. Maguire concedes a free kick by mounting Blind on the edge of the area, and there goes that pressure.90 min +1: The first of seven added minutes - thanks to VAR - passes reasonably quietly under the circumstances. But the tension in Guimaraes is palpable.90 min: The ball bobbles around the edge of the Dutch area. It breaks to Kane, who spins and whistles a first-time shot towards the bottom left. It’s just wide. Cillessen had it covered.88 min: Phew. Say what you will about VAR, it certainly delivers drama. Both of those decisions were correct. But England were so, so close to the final there. Millimetres away.87 min: Nope. The ball clearly hit his back, not his arm. But England still got away with one there, because the ball had broken off Chilwell to Bergwijn, who really should have scored from ten yards, but sent a poor effort off target.86 min: And then, adding to the VAR drama, Dumfries cuts in from the right and smashes a cross into Chilwell. Could this be a handball?!85 min: Lingard was indeed a boot offside. It’s all level again.84 min: But there’s a VAR check. A suspicion that Lingard was a smidgen offside.England split Holland apart with ease! Chilwell bombs down the left and cuts inside. He passes infield for Sterling, who flicks back for Barkley. The midfielder slips an instant pass down the middle to release Lingard, who draws Cillessen and slips the ball into the bottom right!81 min: Sterling has an opportunity to run at the Dutch defence, but inexplicably leaves the ball behind. A few players betrayed by their nerves right now.79 min: This is a wild end-to-end affair now. Sterling nearly releases Kane down the inside-right channel, but just as the England captain shapes to shoot, De Jong slides in to block. Then Dumfries is once again found in acres on the right, but can’t find a team-mate with England light at the back. A real sense, at the end of a long season, that nobody fancies extra time tonight.78 min: It’s not immediately successful, as Van de Beek is afforded a ludicrous amount of space down the middle. He slips a ball wide for Dumfries, who is free just inside the box on the right. The ball comes back to Van de Beek, ten yards out. He’s got the goal at his mercy but leans back and hoicks high over the bar. What a chance!77 min: Henderson comes on for Delph, presumably with a remit to wrest back control of the midfield.76 min: England enjoy their first sustained period in the Dutch half for quite a while. There’s some head tennis on the edge of the box, but the pressure’s relieved when Kane nudges De Ligt out of the way when the player’s in mid-air.75 min: Extra time and penalties, then?This had been coming. The corner’s curled towards the near post. De Ligt, at fault for England’s goal, makes up for it by rising over Walker and bashing a header down and into the bottom right. Unstoppable! Pickford had no chance.72 min: Promes is quickly into the action, and from a position 25 yards out, down the inside-left channel, he curls towards the top right. The ball’s deflected out for a corner, and the set piece comes to nothing. But Holland are beginning to pin England back, and Dumfries earns another corner, out on the right, off Chilwell.70 min: Kane is booked for an agricultural hack on Blind from behind. That was a saucy one. Another referee might have shown him a red, because he wasn’t going for the ball."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1840c37252b55010852dce730b30d2187376f32d/0_435_8087_4853/master/8087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d491119d953dbc0db2e921189eba248","title":"working from home the apps wifi and websites youll need to keep life on track","story":"When you’re juggling a job, kids and a busy social life, the internet is your best friend. Writer Sarah Pyper shares some handy tips and the best apps to help you stay on top of everythingLike 4.2m others in the UK – and a further 1.8m who’d like to – I often work from home. Once a euphemism for staying in bed and watching hours of daytime TV, working from home is now an everyday occurrence for those developing businesses, working flexible hours around the care of loved ones, or just avoiding spending time jammed into the armpits of their fellow commuters. All you need is a laptop, a reliable wifi connection and you’re set.But if you don’t have reliable wifi, it doesn’t matter how organised you are, how snazzy your tech is, or which shiny new game you’ve got to occupy your kids with, it will all fall apart. Thick walls, mirrors and even windows can create wifi blackspots that turn your home-working dream into a nightmare. However, Virgin Media’s new Intelligent WiFi with Hub 3, WiFi boosters and Connect app can be relied on to save the day. While the Intelligent WiFi system is designed to deliver the best wifi signal across your home, the Connect app also allows you to pause specific devices – which comes in particularly handy when you need to put the kids to bed.As someone who juggles writing and editing with social media side projects and caring for two children, my home isn’t just my castle, it’s my office, my gym, my laundry and my sanctuary – so I rely on home tech and some key apps to get it all done.Digital helpWith digital assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant or Apple’s Siri, you can delegate domestic tasks while you work. They can turn up your heating, adjust the lighting using smart bulbs, feed your pet with devices such as Feed and go Smart Pet Feeder, or control a video doorbell such as Nest Hello so you don’t have to get up to see who’s interrupting you. If it’s time for a break, your smart kettle can start making a cuppa, while your smart toaster warms a slice. Even better, you can link your assistant to a robot vacuum cleaner such as Roomba to clean your carpet, or iRobot Braava, which will mop your floor, meaning you can ace your deadlines and complete your chores at the same time.Keep the kids occupiedA bored child trying to join in your conference call, especially at a tricky moment, has the potential to shatter that illusion of professionalism you’ve been carefully cultivating– just ask Prof Robert Kelly, whose four-year-old daughter interrupted a live TV interview with BBC News. My deadlines and reputation have often been saved by a well-timed gaming app for the kids. Minecraft is a long-time family favourite where you can build entire worlds, and Roblox sees the kids connecting with their friends in a bid to run a pizza parlour, adopt a baby or take care of a pet kitten. If emergency strikes, relinquish your phone and let them take selfies with special effects filters until you’re done. Works every single time.Seek inspirationWhen I need to feel more productive, I listen to the How I Built This podcast’s interviews with successful business owners such as Bobbi Brown for inspiration. Or, for a quick energy boost, the 7 Minute Workout app gets you moving with a set of 30-second exercises. If all else fails, ask Siri to play an upbeat playlist on Spotify at top volume, and thank your lucky stars you’re not in a communal office.Beat the working-from-home bluesThe downsides of working at home can be the domestic distractions (the kettle needs descaling) and feeling isolated (there are only so many conversations you can have with the cat). If things get a little quiet, I switch on Coffitivity or Noisli, which provide background noise so you can pretend you’re strolling through woodland or a Parisian street while you sort out your accounts. To avoid procrastination, I turn to Forest or Tomato Timer. Plant a virtual tree on Forest and it will grow – but only as long as you focus on your work and don’t check any other apps. Tomato Timer helps you follow the Pomodoro Technique where you work intensely for 25 minutes then take a five-minute break when you’ve finished your task.Looking for faster connectivity? Or just fed up of losing connection halfway through your favourite TV series?

If it is ailing, we are all – in some inexplicably linked way – ailing, too. See also: the porosity or otherwise of Man United’s back four and M\u0026ampS lingerie sales. These are our bellwethers. I strongly expect Labour’s next manifesto to announce that Bond movies will be nationalised, so that the grumpily ripped superspy can shag incredibly hot women in spa hotels for the many, and not for whoever he’s doing it now. The Queen, I think? I rarely understand the plots.Anyway, each time a new Bond film is announced, shot and released, every aspect of it is picked over for clues as to Where We’re At, in a form of ination upon which we’ll confer the working title Bondomancy. How, then, are we to interpret news that there has not simply been an explosion on set of the latest iteration of the series, but that the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has begun an investigation? We shall come to various facetious answers to that question shortly.First, the details. Speaking of working titles, the movie in question is the 25th Bond film, and it was reported back in February that it would be called Shatterhand. Shatterhand was one of Blofeld’s aliases in the Fleming books – but, much more importantly, it’s just an innately silly word. Indeed, after the internet had spent a day having fun and games with it, Barbara Broccoli was fairly swift to stamp on suggestions that this was going to be the real title.That remains shrouded in secrecy, but the movie is filming at Pinewood studios, in west London, and it was here, on Tuesday, that the explosion took place. According to various reports, it occurred on a set dressed as a Porton Down lab, with an excess of gas causing a bigger series of explosions than was planned, which injured the crew member.But it is the involvement of the HSE that has captured the imagination. The body is rivalled only by the EU as a ludicrously miscast national bogeyman, and its arrival on the Bond set to begin inquiries has sent some into overdrive. Relishing the chance to unite two of its favourite obsessions, the Daily Mail suggested that the HSE will be Bond’s “most difficult opponent yet”.But all credit to the Sun, whose report features my Most Hyperrealistic Anonymous Source of the Week. Here we go: “A Bond source said: ‘Forget new villain Rami Malek, the only people putting the stoppers on 007 right now are the government suits. They marched in with their briefcases and told the Bond bigwigs they were investigating what had gone on. It takes a lot to put Bond in his place, but this lot have.’”My GOD – this is EXACTLY how humans talk! I hope the producers get this guy on board as a writer, as a sop to their endless quest to making the franchise feel fresh, modern and real. If not, he could literally write Sun copy at his talking speed, and should consequently be hired by that newspaper without delay.In the meantime, instead of resisting the ministrations of Health and Safety, surely the franchise should embrace them. What is Duty of Care, if not a ready-made Bond title in the mould of Quantum of Solace? Or even better: how about Tort of Negligence? Can definitely see Ed Sheeran finding a rhyme for that.Furthermore, couldn’t Health and Safety become an actual character in the movies, appearing in hi-vis jacket and hard hat at opportune moments? Here he comes just as Bond’s about to have to shag some secrets out of someone, with the instruction to use a condom. Here he is again, sealing off the Casino Royale in Montenegro after Le Chiffre’s bleeding-eye poker tell has let him down again, and refusing to reopen it until he is satisfied that no high-stakes gamblers have been exposed to blood-borne pathogens.Or perhaps the HSE character could serve as a sort of devoted bag carrier to 007, like Gary in Veep, always on hand with his bag of amenities to provide Bond with wound disinfectant, accident-in-the-workplace forms, or a warrant to inspect the cable installation in an evildoer’s lair? Something for producers to bear in mind, given the enormity of what the franchise represents.It was in Iron Man 2 that Tony Stark announced he had “privatised world peace” – a notion we ultimately don’t have time to discuss today. But which arguably tends toward the dystopic.Or does it? Perhaps inspired by his most famous role, Robert Downey Jr took to the stage at an Amazon futurology event this week to announce that he was setting up a project to use advanced technologies to end pollution on Earth. “Between robotics and nanotechnology we could probably clean up the planet significantly, if not entirely,” he declared, “within a decade.”I feel like “probably” is doing a lot of heavy lifting, there, but hey – at least he’s trying. I don’t see Chris Hemsworth announcing a robot asteroid mining firm that will free humanity from the bonds of labour this side of 2030.If Thor were to want to make such a declaration, though, the place to do it seems to be the conference Downey was at. Called Amazon re:Mars, it is hosted in a Las Vegas resort by world boss Jeff Bezos, one of those guys who absolutely believes in his unparalleled ability to make the planet a better place. Although not by doing little-people stuff such as paying tax, or decent wages, or taking steps so that his warehouse workers don’t have to piss in bottles to avoid getting the sack. Big stuff, you know. We should definitely trust him.So who’s to say that Downey couldn’t be just as right? Certainly not the experts he cited during his presentation at re:Mars. “God I love experts,” he told the audience. “They’re like Wikipedia with character defects.” A slogan for Michael Gove’s Tory leadership campaign, there, and we can only wish him all the best. (Robert, not Michael, obviously. That would be absurd.)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6128ae19bb1cccbfc85ea68a1642b0c7d69eeb/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e393c4223de977bb28e9d1a6a37cb3c0","title":"i had to honour him the friends who finished avicii final album","story":"After the EDM star died aged 28 last year, his family decided that his album Tim should be completed. How did the chosen collaborators handle such a sensitive task? Last summer, a carefully chosen group of producers was given a challenging task – to complete Tim, the third album by the late Swedish DJ and producer Avicii, AKA Tim Bergling. Released this week, the album was roughly two-thirds finished when Bergling killed himself on 20 April 2018 aged 28.His was the defining voice of EDM, the bombastic, Technicolor dance music that has dominated the charts in this decade. His 2013 song Wake Me Up, with soul singer Aloe Blacc, spent 26 weeks at No 1 on the US Billboard dance singles chart and was for a time the most-streamed song in Spotify history. Bergling became one of the world’s highest-paid DJs and collaborated with Madonna, Coldplay and Nile Rogers, who called him “one of the greatest natural melody writers I’ve ever worked with”.As Bergling’s fame intensified, so did his problems. After being hospitalised in 2014, he was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis caused by excessive drinking. He later had surgery to remove his gallbladder, was prescribed drugs (including the addictive opioid Percocet) for physical pain, depression and anxiety, yet continued his gruelling schedule.By 2016, he’d had enough. He fired his manager and retired from touring. “I know I am blessed to be able to travel all around the world,” he said at the time, “but I have too little left for the life of a real person behind the artist.” In 2017, he released a documentary, Avicii: True Stories. In the final scene, Nina Simone’s Feeling Good blares out as Bergling sunbathes on a tropical beach. It was during this period that he began working on Tim.Previous posthumous records, such as Aaliyah’s I Care 4 U, Eazy-E’s Str8 Off tha Streetz of Muthaphukkin Compton and Joy Division’s Closer, have served as more than just albums they are memorials to their creators. And the task of finishing the work of a person who dies in shocking circumstances presents obvious difficulties – especially when the creator was a producer, not a vocalist: how can you honour their sonic intentions?In the centre of Stockholm are Kinglet Studios, run by Carl Falk, and, a few streets away, Studio Gottefar, occupied by Vincent Pontare and Salem Al Fakir, AKA the duo Vargas and Lagola. These producers, who considered Bergling both a collaborator and a good friend, completed six songs on Tim. It is the most nakedly pop-sounding of all of his albums, edging away from the buzzsaw riffs typical of EDM towards gentler melodies with romantic rather than hedonistic lyrics.Sitting at his desk in Kinglet, Falk has ordered meatballs for lunch (“What a cliche,” he says. “I never normally do this”). He co-wrote One Direction’s What Makes You Beautiful and Nicki Minaj’s Starships, which he modestly calls his “poor attempt to do a Swedish House Mafia song”. It was Bergling’s father, Klas, who approached him to complete the album. “I remember it being not awkward, but definitely strange,” he says softly. “Like he was a messenger of Tim’s ... ‘I have a proposal for you, but I’m still his dad.’”The Bergling family have been working to create a legacy for their son. This year, Klas gave a keynote speech at Ibiza’s biggest dance music conference, the International Music Summit, about mental health in the industry, and the family launched the Tim Bergling Foundation, using Bergling’s immense personal wealth to work with charities dedicated to suicide prevention and mental health issues. The album is part of this legacy – all net proceeds will go the foundation – but despite the positives, it has still been an emotional process for those charged with finishing the songs.Klas approached Falk to finish three songs – Ain’t a Thing, Bad Reputation and Fades Away – which he and Bergling had worked on together. “There was never an ego with him,” says Falk. “As long as I do something that betters the song, I’m going to go for it.” He sits at the keyboard, explaining the DNA of Bergling’s sound with teacherly warmth: Bergling’s signatures are simple, repetitive melodies that mix major and minor chords within the same melody line. The major keys are “like Schlager hooks” – referring to the Germanic Europop tradition – and the minor keys come from country and blues, loaded with longing. When Bergling and Falk initially collaborated, they spoke about sampling south-east Asian and West Indian instrumentation. For the rhythmic steel-drum fill sounds on Bad Reputation, Falk drew direct inspiration from Helt Seriöst, a song by the Swedish rapper Kaliffa that Bergling loved.Falk says that Bergling would “recycle” clips from older songs, meaning he could do the same, even using parts for Bad Reputation from Bergling’s mega-hit Levels. Falk also knew that Bergling wanted to work with a live orchestra, so he programmed versions of his synth riffs for a string arranger, who interpreted them with an orchestra for the album’s last song, Fades Away. Falk has few moral or ethical qualms about the process. “When someone close to you passes, the emptiness becomes a mission,” he says. “He told me that this was the first time he’d enjoyed making music in years, so I had to make this as good as I possibly could to honour him and our friendship.”At Gottefar, Pontare stands tall and broad, with long blond hair, a thick beard and extravagant silver rings on each finger. He nods and hums while Al Fakir speaks with jittery enthusiasm. They began working with Bergling in 2012 and co-wrote and produced his breakthrough singles Hey Brother and Waiting for Love. They also worked on three songs for Tim – Piece of Mind, Tough Love, and Excuse Me Mr Sir – all co-written with Bergling.Al Fakir is keen to emphasise that the making of Tim was a happy time for the shy star. “Tim getting out of that bad place, exercising and meditating,” he says. “He was strong. Everyone could see it.” His sentences trail off when we talk about his death, and whether listening to Tim is a darker or more revealing experience than they had anticipated. They felt Bergling had the same energy and focus during the writing of Tim as during the sessions for his debut album, True. As with Falk, Al Fakir and Pontare evince typical Scandinavian discretion when talking about their friend, preferring gentle diplomacy to emotional outpourings. “There are still more questions than answers, because we’d seen him in a good place,” says Al Fakir.Still, they echo Falk’s impressions: that Bergling was brimming with melodic ideas, and cared more for detail than overall effect. “He was explaining how he wanted the ad libs at the end of the chorus to sound before we’d written the chorus,” laughs Pontare. “We used to say that he’d choose the china for the kitchen before the house was built.” In the years between his retirement from performing and his death, Bergling spent much of his time in Los Angeles, where Pontare and Al Fakir often joined him in his home studio. Drawing on his success with country crossover on Wake Me Up, Bergling was curious about incorporating 90s Californian rock motifs into Tim Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beck and Crazy Town’s 1999 skater rock-rap hit Butterfly were references.Pontare has fond memories of writing lyrics with Bergling while sitting on his balcony, talking about his recovery. Piece of Mind is about “a society that’s moving too fast” and is a song that the duo struggled to listen to after his death, while Pontare says that Excuse Me Mr Sir is about the “corporate world of dance music, and how one person clashes with that”. Listening to the songs after Bergling’s death, they find that they illuminate his state of mind how the DJ felt pressured to live up to the outwardly glamorous lifestyle of his profession, and how young fans might cope with having seen their musical hero struggle.Their roles in the posthumous production process focused largely on arrangement, editing and finishing vocal recordings. For the romantic duet Tough Love, they spoke with the Bergling family and agreed they would not seek out any new vocalists to feature. “I don’t know how much your heart must wear out, as a parent, doing this,” says Al Fakir. The duo re-recorded their guide vocals from the demo with Pontare and his wife, the Swedish singer Agnes, to keep it as close to the last Bergling-approved version as possible.Tim by Avicii is out today.

However, he cemented himself as one of the most hardline contenders when he refused to rule out proroguing parliament to force through no deal if necessary on 31 October.The former cabinet minister is a committed Brexit supporter who is clear she wants the UK to leave on 31 October and consulted clerks about the possibility of proroguing parliament, but has accepted advice against that course of action. She does, however, want to leave with a deal and has a plan to pass mini “bitesize” packages of legislation to demonstrate support for most elements of the withdrawal agreement.Boris JohnsonJohnson was first out of the blocks to declare that he wanted the UK to leave on 31 October – deal or no deal. He would not prorogue parliament to achieve that but has set out an ambition to secure a better deal from Brussels before that date. He favours “alternative arrangements” to avoid a hard border in Ireland, so as to facilitate a “managed exit” from the EU. Sajid JavidA former remainer, the home secretary’s position is that he wants to leave with a deal after a renegotiation with Brussels. However, Javid has said he cannot envisage a circumstance in which the UK would need another extension to the 31 October deadline o and is prepared to oversee a no-deal Brexit, putting him in a more hardline place than Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt.Michael GoveGove, one of the original Brexit campaigners, is clear he does not want the UK to leave without a deal and would be prepared to go beyond 31 October to achieve a better one. However, he is not ruling out a no-deal Brexit if nothing can be renegotiated. His red line is that Brexit must be delivered before the next election.Jeremy HuntHunt is a former remainer who is now clear he wants to leave the UK with a deal and believes that is possible by 31 October. He would send a new negotiating team to Brussels including members of the Democratic Union party and hardline Eurosceptics. If a renegotiation was not possible, then he would be prepared to go for no deal, but he has described that as “political suicide” as it would lead to a confidence vote and potentially an election.Mark HarperThe relatively unknown backbencher has not mapped out a detailed Brexit policy but he wants to leave with a renegotiated deal – like most of the other candidates. He says it is not credible to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October but is open to leaving without a deal if revisions to the withdrawal agreement are not possible.Matt HancockThe health secretary has made it clear that no deal is not an option for him so he would be asking MPs to choose between leaving with a deal and not leaving at all. He would also want to renegotiate Theresa May’s deal with a time limit to the backstop, which the prime minister was unable to achieve.Rory StewartStewart is arguing for a soft Brexit with a deal possibly involving a customs union. He rules out supporting both a second referendum and no deal.Sam GyimahThe former minister is the radical outlier in the contest because he wants a second referendum. He would like a two-step question of leave against remain and then May’s deal against no deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39c8b1420ea524749eb35c3cf96e6395feb1303d/0_364_5465_3279/master/5465.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aa1c0e649027d9e60ce76046f1f3dc6","title":"uk official in charge of brexit border plans resigns","story":"Karen Wheeler’s resignation stokes fears the UK will not be ready for a no-deal Brexit by OctoberThe government official in charge of delivering “frictionless” Brexit border arrangements, including emergency plans for Dover and Ireland in the event of no deal, has quit just two years into her job.Karen Wheeler, director general of Her Majesty’s Revenue \u0026amp Customs Brexit border delivery group, was the lead official coordinating a cross-Whitehall response involving police, ports, customs and freight interests.Her departure is being seen as a blow to the government and increasing the risk that the UK will not be as prepared for a possible no deal on 31 October.“Nothing is happening in Whitehall now. Lots of people have been stood down on Brexit no-deal preparations and there is a general risk that people are just going to see this hiatus as an opportunity to clear off and go into the private sector,” said a source who knows Wheeler.Jon Thompson, HMRC’s chief executive, said in a statement: “I would like to thank Karen for her outstanding work leading the Border Delivery Group to prepare the UK for EU exit and we wish her well for her retirement. We shall be announcing her successor in due course.”Thompson is seen as one of the most brutally honest Whitehall officials in relation to the realities of Brexit, and his openness in multiple appearances in House of Commons select committees warning of ballooning costs of border arrangements has had a knock-on effect in the culture of the department.It meant officials were unafraid of politically inconvenient truths, including Wheeler, who earlier this year said there were no magic technological solutions for preventing a hard border with Ireland in the event of no deal.Wheeler said the UK would need a customs union with the EU, plus something that looked like a single market, to have completely free movement of goods across the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. She was appointed as director general for border coordination at HMRC on 3 July 2017.HMRC declined to comment further on Wheeler’s departure, but there will be fears that other senior officials, including Theresa May’s chief Brexit negotiator, Olly Robbins, may also use the hiatus to seek pastures new.Joe Owen, the Institute for Government’s Brexit programme director, predicted earlier this week that “many of the 16,000 civil servants working on Brexit will now be looking for a change of scenery”. Wheeler is the second senior official to leave in as many months. Philip Rycroft, the civil servant in charge at the Department of Exiting the EU, left on 29 March, even though the UK did not, Owen noted.“There is likely to be even more churn in the levels below, even if it’s not as visible externally,” he said. “By October, with the Brexit deadline rapidly approaching, the officials in some of the key no-deal jobs could have been in post for little more than a few months.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88705694704df5c93698e1462ad0f1b6a8be0622/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=134729dacd0e4fda13855d29c049b607","title":"amanda anisimova shocks simona halep reach french open tennis semi final","story":"• Anisimova stuns defending champion Simona Halep• Marketa Vondrousova to face British No1The thunderstorm expected to rip through Roland Garros on day 13 will be forgotten soon enough if Amanda Anisimova and Marketa Vondrousova become the first teenage finalists in a major championship since 17-year-old Serena Williams beat 18-year-old Martina Hingis at the US Open 20 years ago.That possibility describes a cycle of change that Williams had strangled with her brilliance in compiling 23 majors, a run that has stalled since the 37-year-old grande dame of tennis became a mother in September 2017. She has not won a tournament since and her game has an air of anxiety about it.Her premature departure here – a surprise more than a shock – at the hands of another young prodigy, 20-year-old Sofia Kenin, played a major part in reshaping the draw, which now pits Anisimova against the doughty and clever Australian Ashleigh Barty in one of the semi-finals on Friday and Vondrousova against Johanna Konta in the other.Their task will demand more resilience of them if the stormy weather is as bad as forecast but they are at least in the same lifeboat. All have played some brilliant tennis to get this far. On Thursday under clear skies, the American Anisimova stunned then outlasted the defending champion, Simona Halep, 6-2, 6-4, to become, at 17, the youngest semi-finalist here since Nicole Vaidisova 13 years ago.Barty was equally impressive, if not as obviously dominant, in beating the 14th seed, Madison Keys, 6-3, 7-5. She said later: “That’s probably close to my best match over the last month on the clay - for all of one little blemish trying to serve out the match the first time. It was a really clean match. I felt like I was in control. I was able to put the balls in difficult positions for Maddie.”The glowing testimonies for all the semi-finalists filled every microphone and rippled through every corridor. Pat Cash, a London resident but always an Australian, predicted, tongue in cheek, “an all-Australian final” between Barty and Konta, who was born in Sydney and has called Eastbourne home since she was 14.Chris Evert, who won this title seven times and is now a sage voice on Eurosport, said: “Ash Barty has got more variety than any of the players. She can disrupt anyone’s rhythm. She will need that against Anisimova because she will hit you off the court. She showed power and composure and touch today.“Jo’s had two days since her remarkable win over Sloane. Can she keep that momentum up? That is the question. I think she can, I think she will have hunger and inspiration, but she cannot get down on herself if she doesn’t play up to that level.”She added: “We’ve always said women’s tennis is unpredictable, since Serena hasn’t been dominating the last two or three years. But Amanda played unbelievable today. I was stunned by Jo Konta on Tuesday. I was stunned again today by Amanda.”Evert gave the impression that her compatriot - born in New Jersey and raised in Miami, the American daughter of Russian emigrants – was the one to watch. “Look at this young lady, 17 years old, a star is being born right now. Her idol is Maria Sharapova. She plays like Maria Sharapova. Halep had windows of opportunity but just didn’t take advantage of them on the big points.”Anisimova does not lack for self-belief. A former girls finalist here in 2016, and a winner at Flushing Meadows in 2017, she told the New York Times two years ago, “I definitely want to become No1 in the world and win every grand slam One of each would be like super awesome. I hope to do that one day.”Konta, meanwhile, was glad of an extra day off because of the rearranged timetable in the wake of Wednesday’s washout. She has rarely looked as confident and relaxed before a big match. If she is to match the exact deeds of Sue Barker – the last British winner of the French Open, 43 years ago, as well as reaching semi-finals at Wimbledon and Melbourne, and the fourth round of the US Open – she will need all her composure against Vondrousova, a willowy 19-year-old with easy power on both wings and a keen tennis brain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f3bea09a886e6b05e4d3815d7d008f6eda229a6/0_231_4362_2617/master/4362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faed0fba4e932c977c98f0159f177692","title":"novak djokovic sails past zverev and into semi final with dominic thiem","story":"Novak Djokovic reached the last of his nine French Open semi-finals in 2016 but the world No 1 could hardly have announced his return to the concluding weekend of the tournament more emphatically than he did on Thursday in thrashing the No 5 seed, Alexander Zverev, in straight sets.Since losing in the quarter-finals last year against Marco Cecchinato Djokovic has won 26 grand slam tournament matches in a row. If the reigning Wimbledon, US Open and Australian champion can win another two here, he will hold all four majors concurrently for a second time. If he can extend that run to Wimbledon and New York, he will complete the first calendar slam since Rod Laver in 1969. It is some ask but he seems to have the enthusiasm and energy for it – and the fitness.If and when the rain lifts over Roland Garros on Friday, Djokovic will face a stiffer test in Dominic Thiem than he did in Zverev, who looked drained of imagination and spirit as the Serb cruised to what was an embarrassingly comfortable 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 win in just over two hours on Court Philippe Chatrier.In the other quarter-final Thiem made mincemeat of the inconsistent but dangerous Russian Karen Khachanov 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 in an hour and 47 minutes. They were two disappointing preludes to what will surely be a dramatic day 13.The old order is getting back together again: not only have the four top seeds proved the rankings right for the first time since the 2012 Australian Open but this is the first time since the French Open seven years ago that Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer (who meet in the other semi‑final) have been in the same final four of a major.It is a curious and revealing statistic, maybe. In one regard it says they are going nowhere just yet it also shouts that there have been incursions into their hegemony but not in a lasting way.“It’s a different time for us now than it was five years ago,” Djokovic said. “We’re a bit older but we have still been enjoying some of our best tennis in the biggest events. Dominic is deservedly where he is, one of the top four guys, especially on clay. He’s got that tremendous power with forehand and serve. His backhand also has improved a lot in the last couple of years.”Zverev never properly recovered from blowing his early chance, when he broke for 5-4 and served for the first set. Djokovic, who has hit another pitch here after a mixed run on clay, sensed the German faltering and took his chance.From that point on he had the mental edge as Zverev struggled. The end was limp, Zverev planting a backhand long. It looked as if he had been released from prison.“I had a few 15-40s, a lot of breakpoints,” he said. “I thought the first set should have gone my way. Then I played three really bad games. Once he’s in control he’s very tough to beat. He’s world No 1 for a reason.”For all his obvious talent Zverev has not delivered consistently enough outside the Masters to frighten his peers towards the end of a major. He admitted: “I feel like I’m at a stage where, quarter-finals, something like that, I could go further.”Thiem clearly loves the Parisian clay, a semi-finalist for the fourth year in a row and armed with the invaluable knowledge of a final against Nadal. He has struck a consistently high level throughout this tournament, and he hit flat and hard to leave Khachanov flat-footed.“I think every match I got better and better,” Thiem said. “I’m happy with the way I’m playing. It’s incredibly difficult to win a slam, especially for us players who don’t have one yet.“If everything is normal, we have to beat two players with 15 or more slams. I think everybody can imagine how difficult this is. But I will step on the court tomorrow, try everything and, of course, give everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492932600c874db468836ca76e92ae9f1660a8b1/0_9_4572_2745/master/4572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4a986f951dde1d2078851f7590c8780","title":"rafael nadal roger federer","story":"Nobody in the history of athletic endeavour has dominated a single geographical space the way Rafael Nadal has ruled the 2,106 sq ft of clay marking the boundaries of his work on Court Philippe Chatrier since 2005. His reign, surely, cannot last much longer but on Friday he resumes his duel with Roger Federer in a semi-final that is as significant as their first 14 years ago.The Spaniard, sleeveless and teenaged, beat Federer in the semi-finals that 2005 summer, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, and went on to win the first of his 11 French Opens. The Swiss could not get the better of him in three subsequent efforts, taking a set off him in the final the following year and another in the 2007 final. He then endured the most embarrassing of his 23 defeats in their 38 encounters when a rampant Nadal dispatched him for the loss of only four games in an hour and 48 minutes in 2008.they meet on Chatrier for maybe the last time. Nadal turned 33 this week Federer is 38 in August. It is a match loaded with possibilities. Every time these grand antagonists meet, and it is not so often latterly, the occasion has the air of a farewell. Nadal has not beaten Federer in five years but then Federer has not come to Roland Garros since 2015. Back in the Chatrier fortress, he will wonder if his legs – stretched in a tough quarter-final against Stan Wawrinka – can carry him through a long fight with Nadal.Nadal, by his standards, had an ordinary clay lead-in: knocked out in semi-finals in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Madrid, outposts of his empire, before beating Novak Djokovic in the Rome final. The last time he lost to Federer on clay was in Madrid nine years ago.As ever, they are giving little away, except mutual respect. And, as Federer pointed out, “There is always a chance – otherwise nobody would be in the stadium to watch, because everybody would already know the result.”He might never make a good bookmaker but, if anyone can defy the odds, it is Roger Federer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ead18d1b23b6cdaa33f6731c0c417a8f0576552/539_452_3726_2236/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=548aaa2cbb4ce837508d757542e646f5","title":"samsung galaxy s10 review the sweet spot","story":"Top-end smartphone balances a big screen with smaller body, good performance and triple cameraThe Galaxy S10 is Samsung’s middle-of-the-road top-end phone, featuring a large screen in a pretty compact body for those who don’t like the current breed of massive flagship superphones.The regular, non-plus versions of Samsung’s Galaxy S line have always been the sweet spot between size, price and performance. They offer big, beautiful screens in bodies that are practically tiny by today’s giant-phone standards.The Galaxy S10 isn’t all that small, of course, measuring 70.4mm wide and 149.9mm tall with a stunning 6.1in QHD+ AMOLED screen. It’s about the same size as Apple’s iPhone XS, and considerably smaller than the Galaxy S10+, Huawei P30 Pro and OnePlus 7 Pro. It’s also one of the lightest top-end smartphones on the market at just 157g: 18g lighter than the S10+ and a full 49g lighter than the OnePlus 7 Pro.Its size and weight make it one of easiest top-end phones to handle and pocket. Not once did the Galaxy S10 feel liable to being dropped, even when using it one-handed in packed trains.The design of the Galaxy S10 is attractive, particularly in its pearlescent white, but doesn’t rock the boat. The front is glass so is the back. They both curve at the edges to a thin polished metal band. The screen has a small circular cutout through which the selfie camera pokes.The display also hides Samsung’s ultrasonic fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone with your thumb on the screen. Arguably the most unusual aspect of the Galaxy S10 is the existence of a headphone socket in the bottom – a rare sight for a top-end smartphone in 2019.The phone is water resistant to IP68 standards, or depths of up to 1.5 metres in fresh water for 30 minutes. Drop the S10 in the loo and you’ll be able to rinse it afterwards.The Galaxy S10 has the same processor, memory and storage as the larger Galaxy S10+ and therefore performs similarly. In this US this means Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor, but outside in the UK, Europe and many other regions it means Samsung’s own Exynos 9820, as tested here.Generally the S10 is as snappy as most of the competition, with no noticeable lag. It won’t match the very fastest phones, such as the OnePlus 7 Pro, but it keeps up with the competition and is a big leap over the two-year-old Galaxy S8.Battery life on the S10 was a disappointing 25 hours between charges. With the screen set to FHD+ and the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone would last from 7am on day one until 8am on day two, dying on the train into work. That was while browsing and using apps for five hours with plenty of push messages and emails, watching 60 minutes of offline video, shooting about five photos a day and listening to about five hours of Spotify using Bluetooth headphones.The Galaxy S10 runs Samsung’s new One UI version of Android 9 Pie.One UI is a big upgrade over previous versions of Samsung’s software, refocused around making phones with large screens more usable. While more beneficial for the larger Galaxy S10+, the S10 still benefits from generally having the top half of the phone for viewing information and the bottom half for touch-based interactions.That puts menus, buttons and other touch-interaction points in easier reach of your thumb. Others are doing similar with Android, including Google, but Samsung is the most successful to date – something Apple and its back button in the top left of the screen should take note of.One weak point compared with competitors is Samsung’s gesture navigation system, which simply replaces the standard back, home and overview buttons with swipe pads that do the same thing in the same place on the screen. It’s less ergonomic and fluid than rival systems such as that used by OnePlus, Huawei or even Google’s upcoming Android Q.Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant is serviceable, but not as good as Google Assistant, often failing to understand what is said, so is safe to just avoid.The fingerprint reader is embedded under the screen, using ultrasound to read your ridges through the display. Most other in-display fingerprint readers are optical, which is less secure than ultrasonic sensors, but both can still be fooled like most biometric systems with the right equipment.Overall, the fingerprint scanner is more convenient built right into the screen, but isn’t as fast as traditional capacitive sensors or the fastest of new optical sensors such as that fitted to the OnePlus 7 Pro.The Galaxy S10’s triple rear camera is one of the better systems on the market and is the same as that fitted to the larger Galaxy S10+. It’s main 12-megapixel camera, 12-megapixel telephoto camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide-angle camera work together for easy and flexible shooting modes zooming from 0.5 to 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom.In good light the camera produces some really good photos, with great detail, colour and fast autofocus. In low light the S10 is solid but far behind the very best on the market, even with Samsung’s dedicated night mode.The ultrawide-angle camera is a lot of fun, as is the live focus mode, which records depth information so you can blur the background in portraits or perform colour isolation. You can also post shots straight to Instagram using a dedicated camera mode, while video capture is also excellent.Overall, the rear camera on the S10 matches rivals from Apple, but falls short of the best from Huawei. The S10 also has an excellent single selfie camera poking through the screen.The Samsung Galaxy S10 is an all-round great phone that thankfully keeps things at a manageable size.

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

September is an ideal month to experience the flat, car-free Bodensee-Radweg cycle path (total length 260km). You will see snow-capped Alps to the south, terraced vineyards, apple orchards and onion-domed churches. It takes in the fairytale medieval town of Meersburg, the Unesco-listed monastery of St Gallen, and the famous lion guarding Lindau’s harbour. Campsites abound, as do lakeside resorts such as Überlingen. Ferries crisscross the lake if time is short, and afterwards you can boast that you’ve cycled three countries: Germany, Austria and Switzerland. • bodensee-radwegRobertA great way to experience the northern Spanish peaks of Asturias is a loop around the Ponga natural park. Leave the car at the first (free) car park on the AS261 (near the N625 junction) and take your bike anti-clockwise right around the park. The scenery is breathtaking, initially following the Ponga river, and passing through villages as you climb up to get a better view of the mountains. We had a delicious Asturian lunch at Fonda Ponga (no website) near San Juan de Beleño, where we could prop our bikes by picnic benches. Don’t eat too much as the biggest climb is still to come and the most dramatic views. Then it’s downhill all the way. Rejoin the N625 at San Ignacio for a quick spin back to the car.

A non-taxing “taster” might be to follow a stretch (around 30km) along the meandering e Semois River, surrounded by lush wooded hills, You could start with a visit to the Abbaye d’Orval in Florenville, perhaps sampling the Trappist monks’ beer and cheese. Setting off north-west along the well-signposted route, you’ll want to stop after only 4km to visit Chassepierre, one of the “most beautiful Wallonian villages”. Then ride on through the quiet valley to explore the medieval town of Bouillon with its fortified castle. • walloniabelgiumtourismF ChaillierThe Lac d’Hourtin-Carcans area is full of cycle routes through pristine sand dunes covered in pine forests. There are many places to stay in the area that have direct access to the routes, but my favourite is Camping de la Dune Bleue (from €14 a night) in the forest with access to the lake. My favourite route is to Lacanau-Océan further down the coast, as you can take a circular route and rarely encounter any roads or any other people apart from cyclists. Stay at the campsite, leave your car in the car park and cycle everywhere. Awesome!SallyLast stop before the Swiss border in Lombardy is this valley where a family-friendly cycle route follows the river Adda for 114km from the mountain town of Bormio to Lake Como. Weaving through meadows, villages, vines and orchards, almost the entire route is traffic free. It’s clearly waymarked, the map is detailed and one-way bike hire works well with seven rental points. We took the train to Tirano, hired bikes and cycled gently downhill to Colico, a full day’s pedalling. As well as regular picnic spots, there are plenty of dining and sleeping options en route - our favourite was La Fiorida agriturismo (doubles from €102 B\u0026ampB) with a fab farm shop and an air of rustic luxury.• sentiero.valtellina.itMarthaThe Bay of Kotor is a huge fjord-like inlet on the coast of Montenegro. Cruising the road that hugs the shoreline by bike is a perfect way to see it from all angles. This is definitely a route for leisurely cycling: you’ll pass plenty of tempting waterside bars and cafes, and perfect spots for a dip in the clear blue water. The route is around 26 miles including a short ferry crossing at the narrowest part of the bay. There are plenty of places to hire bikes in Kotor town. HeatherMallorca is renowned for its beautiful mountains and beaches, but the Via Verde is a gorgeous cycle ride: 30km of railway converted to a rural path through the island’s flatter eastern side. Ramshackle windmills, the Llevante hills, fields of oranges and olives, and ancient castles. The smells alone will inspire you. Conclude the ride in Artà and delight in a late paella lunch at unpretentious Bar S’Estacio, or ice-cold sangria and tapas at La Casita Arta. Windswept Cala Mesquida close by is exquisite.• theothermallorcaAntony TFor an exhilarating downhill ride with breathtaking scenery, this sublime 80km mountain-to-fjords road route runs alongside the Bergensbanen and Flåmsbanen railway lines, so is easily accessible by train from Bergen or Oslo. One day adventurers alight at Finse, Norway’s highest railway station, at 1222 metres, and hire a bike from a shop right on the platform (finse1222.co.no, £68 a day). From the stunning Hallingskarvet mountain backdrop to the picturesque Aurlandsfjord, navigating steep hairpin bends to freewheeling past traditional farms, this 57km descent to Flåm does not disappoint.

It can be adapted for all levels of ability: you can climb higher on some stretches, or take the frequent train and ferry services between, say, Geneva, Lausanne and the delightful spa town of Evian, to complete shorter legs. Flower-bedecked towns and villages to visit along the way include Yvoires and Montreux. Cycling clockwise will keep you closest to the lake. • lake-geneva-switzerlandClareThe Inn cycle path follows the River Inn for over 500km from its source above St- Moritz in Switzerland all the way to Germany where it meets the Danube. We hired from Crazy Bikez in Innsbruck and spent five days cycling the path’s Austrian section, which was well-signed, predominantly traffic-free, and though the vistas were massive snow-capped peaks, the ride itself was free of any great ascents. The trip took us past medieval castles and fortresses, churches and monasteries. While in Tyrol make sure you visit one or two of their schnapps distilleries. • tyrolTimLooking for a holiday with a difference?

We’ve had an amazing run but there are five books left and who knows what could happen in a few years’ time?”She said “sometimes it’s good to leave people wanting more” but agreed that the “door had been left open” for more of the adventures of the Poldark family.However, any decision about the drama’s return would be down to the BBC and makers Mammoth Screen. “The BBC would need to say that they wanted more and we’d take it from there. The relationship with the Winston Graham estate and with the BBC has been wonderful – I like to think they wouldn’t want anyone else to do it.”Poldark has been a phenomenon for the BBC, made household names of its stars Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson and prompted an unprecedented interest in scything following Turner’s bare-chested wielding of one of the farming tools.The books were adapted before, in the 1970s, and this latest incarnation has shown the enduring popularity of the Graham books.One of the difficulties of a Poldark comeback, Horsfield acknowledged, would be getting the cast and crew back together. She is writing a new adaptation of a contemporary novel and some of the actors, such as Tomlinson, have gone on to star in Hollywood films.Ellise Chappell, who got her big break playing one of the younger characters, Morwenna, and recently appeared in acclaimed Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis film Yesterday, said it “would be great” if Poldark returned in future.The final series, which airs in July, is billed as one of the must-see TV shows of the year, with Ross Poldark and his foe, George Warleggan, dealing with the aftermath of the death of George’s wife, Elizabeth.In series five Horsfield has bridged the gap between novels seven and eight by, in consultation with the Graham estate, piecing together what happened in the intervening decade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4886d0adace264e89b4eaac327a09d64493ca2f8/0_257_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cda847d3c7b90a3203c9144731f0b4ad","title":"haunted me for rest of my life veterans recall d day landings","story":"Emotions conflict at 75th anniversary in Normandy as scale of human sacrifice is remembered It was a great day. It was a terrible day. So, as the dwindling few who bore witness to the monumental feat of endeavour and ingenuity of D-day returned to Normandy’s beaches, emotions were conflicted. Street parties, flypasts, swing bands and sing-a-longs contrasted with solemn ceremonies where the celebratory was vastly outweighed by reminders of the scale of human sacrifice.On the seafront at Arromanches, overlooking Gold beach where 75 years ago a blue-grey armada had filled the horizon as far as the eye could see, a lone piper marked H-hour. It was the moment at 7.26am when the first British soldier landed on Gold beach exactly 75 years ago.D-day was an invasion of France by allied forces. It was codenamed Operation Neptune, and it aimed to push Nazi Germany out of occupied France. Five beaches in Normandy, codenamed Omaha, Utah, Juno, Sword and Gold, were the main targets for landing a large number of troops by sea.At 10pm on 5 June 1944, troops began departing from British shores to head across the Channel. Five assault groups set sail under darkness in an armada of about 7,000 vessels. Just after midnight on 6 June, aerial bombardment of enemy positions on the Normandy coast began. Special operations troops were also parachuted into France.US troops landed on Omaha and Utah beaches at about 6:30am. About an hour later Canadian forces landed at Juno, and British troops landed at Gold and Sword. Soldiers had to get off their boats, wade through the water, and seize control of the beach, all the while under heavy and sustained fire from German defensive positions.Despite involving a large number of troops, keeping D-day secret was vital to the success of the operation. A disinformation campaign had led the Germans to believe that Operation Fortitude was the main plan for the allies to invade the continent, via a two-pronged attack involving Norway and Calais. Even once the\u0026nbspD-day\u0026nbsplandings had begun, German commanders were convinced they were just a ersionary tactic before the real invasion.The D in D-day actually has no particular significance to Operation Neptune. It was common practice in the military to make plans that used the term, where the D stands for the day when operations commenced. Military planners also set H-hour, the time at which a plan was to begin.By the end of the day, the allies had disembarked more than 135,000 men and 10,000 vehicles on to the beaches, and established bridgeheads of varying depths along the Normandy coastline. This came at the cost of 4,400 allied troops being killed, with thousands more injured or missing. There were also heavy casualties among German troops and French civilians.By 19 August, the allied forces had pushed down far enough to begin the battle to liberate Paris. German troops surrendered the French capital on 25 August 1944, two and a half months after D-day.The lone piper Maj Macey-Lille, of 19th Regiment Royal Artillery (the Scottish Gunners), stood atop the decaying vestige of the Mulberry harbour still embedded in the sand, to play Highland Laddie as crowds gathered.For veterans who had returned to Normandy, seeing the beaches and the quiet villages, now household names, that they fought their way through in France, is still overwhelming. Memories were of running for the dunes, bullets bouncing, shells screaming, beaches vibrating as the allied naval guns pounded German targets to provide cover for those going in.The cemeteries are particularly emotional. “You think to yourself, all them lying there, why aren’t I one of them? Because I were with them,” says Ray Mellors, 94, from Nottingham, who as an 18-year-old with the South Staffordshire Regiment, had waded through the sea, “in the dark and wet”, towards Sword beach shortly after D-day.“It’s haunted me for the rest of my life. I sit here now, and I think to myself ‘I shouldn’t be here, really. I should be under the ground where the others are’.”When his battalion was decimated, he was part of the reserves, waiting to be placed with others to replace men they had lost. He first joined the Welch Regiment, then the Black Watch, moving through France, Belgium, the Netherlands and finally, Germany. “And, I was always thinking to myself ‘my time is going to come, I know it is’. But it didn’t.”“There was a lot going on,” says John Eden, 94, from Silverdale, Morecambe Bay, who as a 19-year-old private in the 12th (Airborne) Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment landed the day after D-day. “This brings back feelings you don’t really want to feel.”He says: “Don’t forget, I was a terrified little lad.”He could not explain why he had been drawn back. “What can you say? I had four years in the army, and this was part of it, an experience that you can’t comprehend, can you? You can’t imagine how you did it”. At Ranville war cemetery, he planned to visit “two particular graves” for fallen comrades.Away from the cemeteries, there is a carnival atmosphere on Normandy’s streets during the 75th commemorations. Many, still find it unbelievable that local people will come up, shake their hand, and say thank you.Revisiting the small villages, Douglas Russell, 97, who lives in Morecambe, was surprised at the warm welcome. “All the people that have turned up, people shaking my hand. It’s nice. But I’m not a hero, just an ordinary chap.”This is the first time he has returned since landing on Sword beach, with the 43rd Wessex infantry ision two days after D-day. “Seeing all the crowds has amazed me. I am glad I came. At my time of life it’s the only chance I’ll get, isn’t it?” He went all the way to Berlin. His job was to treat the water from rivers and streams to ensure that his men had safe drinking water.James Anderson, 97, a signalman, was seconded to the Norwegian destroyer Glaisdale, which on D-day escorted the Canadians to Juno beach, firing on the German defences to soften them before the troops ran for the beach, then closing in to provide cover. “We were hitting machine-gun posts. “And, as the firing destroyed a house, the house would fall on the machine gunner and give them more protection, so we had to go really close in and get rid of them,” he says.He watched those on the landing crafts struggle through the waves under fire to reach the shore. “All the landing craft were flat bottomed, and I felt very sorry for the men because most of them were seasick. Then they had to go onshore against the enemy. Not very good.”He spent the rest of June 1944 protecting the beach, until his ship hit a mine, and he was injured. They were towed back to the UK where he was hospitalised for two weeks.“I know I am the only one left from my ship, now,” he says.This was the second time he had returned to Normandy. He had never wanted to come back before. “It’s unfortunately part of your life, and when the war finished, all I wanted to do was get back to my wife, and rear a family, and forget it,” says Anderson, from Manchester, who went on to work for an advertising agency.Visiting the cemeteries would be hard, he says. “I know I am not going to like it when we get to Omaha and see the American cemetery. Those numbers of graves are just too much.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc931fe54527b579483e245d06946362a0689916/0_38_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf2bcbae2d6c802f0132932d16b32895","title":"led not into temptation pope approves change to lords prayer","story":"New wording for Catholics asks God not to ‘let us fall into temptation’Its words are memorised by Christian children all over the world and repeated at almost every act of Christian worship: “Our Father, who art in heaven….”Now Pope Francis has risked the wrath of traditionalists by approving a change to the wording of the Lord’s Prayer. Instead of saying “lead us not into temptation”, it will say “do not let us fall into temptation”.The new wording was approved by the general assembly of the Episcopal Conference of Italy last month. It will appear in the third edition of the Messale Romano, the liturgical book that contains the guiding texts for mass in the Roman Catholic church.The pope said in 2017 he believed the wording should be altered.“It is not a good translation because it speaks of a God who induces temptation,” he told Italian TV. “I am the one who falls. It’s not him pushing me into temptation to then see how I have fallen.“A father doesn’t do that, a father helps you to get up immediately. It’s Satan who leads us into temptation, that’s his department.”According to the Bible, Jesus taught the words to his disciples when they asked him how they should pray.Some have expressed concern about changes to the wording. Meredith Warren, a lecturer in biblical and religious studies at Sheffield University, said: “This new version of the Lord’s Prayer tries to avoid implying that God has some hand in evil.“But in doing so the pope not only overlooks the many biblical examples where God works with the devil to tempt his followers and even his own son. The new version actually goes against the plain meaning of the Greek of the gospel text.”After French bishops altered the words in 2017, Philip Lawler, the editor of Catholic World News, a conservative website, said the change was “very upsetting” because the prayer was so deeply ingrained.“Pope Francis has made a habit of saying things that throw people into confusion, and this is one of them,” he told the New York Times. “It just makes you wonder, where does it stop, what’s up for grabs? It’s cumulative unease.”The Catholic church in England and Wales said it had no immediate plans to change the wording. “The Lord’s prayer has been changed in the Italian language – there are no plan at present for it to change in English,” said a spokesperson.“Each language will be studied to see the specific meaning and understanding of the language. I am sure there will be some consultation with the English-speaking nations.”Anglican worshippers can choose between traditional and contemporary versions of the prayer, but both include the words “lead us not into temptation”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af95e5853ba882c5e3068d6f408579ac1bb02425/0_140_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3ead50d3c9a0d1263b09db2cc92b8ff","title":"museum visitor cracks code to unlock secrets of mystery safe","story":"Tourist hails ‘lucky guess’ after random numbers open 900kg container sealed for decadesWhen Stephen Mills spotted a dusty old safe in a museum in Canada, he thought he’d try to crack the code, “just like in the movies”. But when he began turning the dial, he wasn’t expecting a Hollywood ending.For years, anyone who visited the Vermillion Heritage Museum in Alberta would have passed by a large, black metal box. Staff knew it had come from the long-gone Brunswick hotel and was donated to the museum in the 1990s. But its code and contents remained a mystery for decades – until Mills unexpectedly cracked the combination.Mills, a resident of Fort McMurray, also in Alberta, was visiting the museum with his family last month over a holiday weekend. As they wandered around the exhibits with the museum guide, Tom Kibblewhite, they spotted the safe.Kibblewhite told the family what he tells all other guests: the 900kg (2,000lb) black box with a silver dial had remained closed for generations.For years, the safe has confounded volunteers at the museum. The manufacturer was unable to provide advice on how to open its thick door. A locksmith suggested to the museum that years of inactivity might have slowed down the finicky gears, rendering it inoperable. After pressing his ear against the cool metal, he began spinning the dial. With numbers ranging from zero to 60, he turned clockwise three times to 20, counter-clockwise two times to 40, and then clockwise one time to 60.He was astonished to hear a click. “I jumped up and told everyone I’m buying a lottery ticket,” he said.Shocked and amused volunteers quickly gathered to see what treasure had remained hidden for more than three decades.

Either the Socialist party governs or the Socialist party governs,” he added.The 47-year-old’s party won 123 seats out of 350 in the general election on 28 April.“He is profiting from the fact that the opposition is very fragmented, and can’t organise any alternative majority,” said Pablo Simon, a politics expert at Madrid’s Carlos III University.Negotiations with other parties will not be easy – in all, 17 political groupings are represented in Spain’s fragmented national parliament.The far-left coalition Unidas Podemos, with its 42 seats, has already shown its willingness to back Sánchez in the traditional parliamentary confidence vote that follows any general election.But in exchange, it wants to enter a coalition government.“What would be most sensible would be if there is a progressive coalition government in Spain … that guarantees political stability for the next four years,” said Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias.The socialists are not keen on that scenario, preferring to rule alone in a minority government which would seek the support of other parties on a case-by-case basis when passing laws or reforms.Even with the support of Unidas Podemos, Sánchez will still need other regional parties to get the majority he needs.He will however try to avoid courting Catalan and Basque separatist lawmakers, which would be likely to lead to accusations that he is putting the unity of Spain in peril.Two weeks after municipal and regional elections, negotiations have already started at a local level and could also influence which parties decide to give their support or not.No date for the vote in parliament to elect a PM has been set but it is likely to be in early July, a parliamentary source said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15456202581321645e2575fb3cfa1e571f70a24d/0_206_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22f2272bf6242cfaa58c3f33de20edc8","title":"stonewall riots new york apology nypd commissioner ","story":"Action at Stonewall Inn that provoked resistance and catalyzed fight for LGBT rights was ‘discriminatory’ says James O’NeillNew York City’s police commissioner has apologized for the 1969 police raid at the Stonewall Inn in the city, which catalyzed the modern LGBT rights movement.Commissioner James O’Neill said on Thursday that “the actions taken by the NYPD were wrong” at the gay bar in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village neighborhood.He called the actions and laws of the time, which prohibited homosexuality and just being in a gay bar could prompt an arrest “discriminatory” and said, “For that, I apologize.”The apology comes just weeks ahead of the 50th anniversary of the raid and the rebellion it sparked on 28 June 1969. Bar patrons on the night, soon joined by others, fought back against officers, after frequent bar raids and arrests, and against a social order that kept gay life in the shadows.It wasn’t the first time that LGBT people had demonstrated or clashed with police, but it proved a turning point that spurred a wave of activism.After days and nights of protest and rioting, members of the LGBT population courageous enough to be seen in public supporting a campaign for equal rights began a march from “the village” through the city to protest against discrimination. Marchers were met with some cheers but faced a lot of yelled abuse from onlookers.The following June, the first official gay pride parade took place in New York to mark the anniversary of what became known as the Stonewall uprising, and continued through the 70s, the Aids crisis and into the era of campaigning for greater legal protections and same-sex marriage.The Stonewall Inn, on the village’s famous Christopher Street, was declared a national monument under the Obama administration in 2016 and is still a busy bar and nightspot.“Stonewall was the event where gay people finally stood up and fought back in a way they never had in New York before,” Charles Kaiser, author of The Gay polis, an acclaimed chronicle of American gay life from 1940 to 1996, told the  at the time the national monument designation was in process.Several exhibitions in New York are commemorating the uprising, which will culminate in the 50th anniversary celebrations later this month.He had spontaneously apologized at an event in 2004, in response to a question from the audience, the New York Times reported in 2010, after his death that year.Pine told the  that on the night in 1969, he and his officers were just doing their jobs, and were shocked when the bar patrons, sick of harassment, fought back, with the outlaw rebellion led by drag queens, gender non-conforming men and women, homeless patrons and queer prostitutes.“We knew something had happened that had never happened before. We’d never had any trouble, but it just came out of nowhere,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dc8693b173112b633eda98011a5309b36bf6c28/0_0_2556_1533/master/2556.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e48e6426dc97f00d6dce8b96e4df50af","title":"sudan african union suspension military rulers","story":"Expulsion heaps pressure on military rulers to establish civilian-led transitional authoritySudan has been suspended from the African Union (AU) amid growing fears that splits among the ruling military regime could lead to civil war and anarchy.The decision by the union – which has 54 other member states – will significantly increase pressure on the country’s new military rulers, raising the prospect of diplomatic isolation on the continent and sanctions if they do not hand over power to a civilian-led authority to allow an “exit from the current crisis”.In a strongly worded statement, the AU said it deplored the loss of innocent lives in recent days in Sudan and called for the military and security forces to ensure the full protection of civilians and respect for human rights and freedoms.The AU’s decision was prompted by the deaths on Monday of more than 120 people when paramilitaries attacked a protest camp in the centre of Khartoum. Many hundreds were injured.There is increasing anxiety among observers that the crisis will exacerbate isions within Sudan’s security establishment, raising the prospect of armed factions battling for power.“The isions … are real and very deep and … raise the prospect of army units turning their guns on each other,” said Rashid Abdi, a Nairobi-based analyst of east African politics. “That was already the nightmare scenario and now it looks more real than ever.”The AU had set repeated deadlines in a bid to force concessions from the transitional military council (TMC), which seized power when the dictator Omar al-Bashir was ousted in April after months of mass protests.Negotiations between the military and protest leaders broke down due to disagreements over whether a planned transitional body would be headed by a civilian or a military figure.The deaths on Monday have been blamed on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which is largely made up of militias accused of systematic human rights abuses during the war in Darfur.The force is led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who also serves as the deputy head of the TMC.Trained officers drawn from Sudan’s elite look down on Dagalo, a semi-literate camel trader turned warlord from the far south who was promoted by Bashir, and see him as swaggering and arrogant.Tensions also exist between senior officers who benefited from Bashir’s regime and want to retain much of the repressive system he put in place and the opportunities for enrichment it provides them, and younger officers who are more sympathetic to the pro-democracy movement.There are unconfirmed reports claim that hundreds of lower ranking officers of the regular army have been ordered to posts outside Khartoum, and that dozens whose loyalty has been deemed suspect have been disarmed and detained.Jean-Baptiste Gallopin, a political analyst and expert on the role of armed forces in revolutions, said the crackdown could be a trigger for an attempt by dissatisfied elements within the military to move against the current leaders.“A coup can only succeed quickly … A failed coup could lead to a civil war. It is a very dangerous situation,” Gallopin said. “The TMC has pushed itself into a corner by using this violence, the opposition is defiant and will not accept negotiation and at this stage it looks as if the only option for the TMC is a strategy of large scale repression.”Monday’s crackdown prompted outrage in western capitals, but China and Russia blocked a United Nations resolution condemning the attacks.Russia said on Thursday it opposed foreign intervention in Sudan and that the authorities in Khartoum should subdue what it described as extremists.The TMC has also received diplomatic support from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Both countries have also offered significant financial assistance.Khartoum and other cities in Sudan remained tense on Thursday, with further reports of scattered gunfire. Pro-democracy groups in Sudan called for supporters to avoid all violent confrontation with security forces.“Build barricades and leave. If they are removed we can return and build new ones later … Our revolution is committed to peace,” the Sudanese Professionals Association said on social media.Officials in the Sudanese capital have for the first time given a figure for the death toll in this week’s violence, claiming that 61 people were killed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43d3534461ed6f84420cbf3bbe91c0125ffc19a9/0_416_5376_3226/master/5376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00f70e8f849554e59d7e3386646d5656","title":"d day landings remembered on 75th anniversary in pictures","story":"Veterans and world leaders have attended ceremonies to mark 75 years since allied troops landed in France during the second world war"},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Pontiff agrees to rewording to remove implication God may lead people into temptationFingal County Council made planning application to An Bord Plean\u0026aacutelaInspectors \u0026lsquonot assured\u0026rsquo the water at Merlin Park community nursing unit was safeSeries of information sessions for school authorities began this weekKeeping small towns and villages alive is hard going \u0026ndash Trump\u0026rsquos hotel provides jobsHamilton insists ombudsman complained to PSNI about Loughinisland document \u0026lsquotheft\u0026rsquoIreland\u0026rsquos ambassador to the US Dan Mulhall and Senator Mark Daly in attendanceProtest organisers say the US president \u0026lsquothreatens us all\u0026rsquo as Trump returns to IrelandTwenty-five CCTV cameras at Shannon Airport and Doonbeg feed plethora of screensIrish men played an important part in the Normandy landings despite Irish neutralityCatholic archdiocese and centre\u0026rsquos management cite each other as responsible for moveFiona Wheeler (68) has opposed every US presidential visit but sees Trump as \u0026lsquothe most dangerous\u0026rsquoD\u0026uacuten Laoghaire-Rathdown and city councils issue notices expected to last seven daysExam Diary: \u0026lsquoTaking part in plays, I\u0026rsquom well-used to learning lines and scripts\u0026rsquoMajor new study finds cocaine use growing faster in Ireland than in most European countries\u0026lsquoThe loss of a father, son, brother is beyond words\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash family of Bryan CassidySylva Tukula\u0026rsquos friends say failure of State agencies to notify them of her burial was \u0026lsquodeeply offensive\u0026rsquoAoife Dooley receives dozens of abusive messages since Wednesday\u0026rsquos English exam"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3917305.1559846940!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il set to hold power across dublin as mayoral roles given out","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFinglas native Cllr Paul McAuliffe, a 10-year veteran of the council, is in line to run for the Dáil in the next general election. Fianna Fáil councillor Paul McAuliffe, is set to be elected the 350th Lord Mayor of Dublin on Friday in a voting pact with the Green party and Labour and the Social Democrats.On Thursday evening, Fianna Fáil was also seeking to secure positions of power across the three other Dublin local authorities.Any party can put forward a mayor for election, with the candidate who gets the most votes from their fellow councillors securing the chain of office for the next year.With no party strides ahead of another, it took longer than usual to determine what combination of parties and Independents would effectively “rule” the council, through what is known as the “mayors and chairs” deal.This voting pact determines who will hold the mayoralty for each of the five years until the next local elections. The Green Party will likely take the chain of office next year, and depending on the make-up of the pact Fianna Fáil or the Greens could take it again before the next local elections.The pact also sees the parties take up the more prominent chairing roles on the council, with the chair of the housing strategic policy committee generally the most sought after because of its high profile nature. However, councillors from parties not involved in the pact will also get to chair some committees during the five-year term.Draft documentThe arrangement is also based on policy agreements between the parties. A draft document shows a focus on climate change actions, including carbon, litter and pollution reductions. Transport and public realm issues, including pedestrian and cycling initiatives, such as the long awaited College Green plaza project, and the pedestrianisation of a number of city streets, are also set out. There are also measures aimed at increasing public housing provision and providing public toilets.Fianna Fáil has not had a Lord mayor in over a decade since Eibhlin Byrne in 2008, and before that its last was Royston Brady in 2003.Finglas native McAuliffe, a 10-year veteran of the council, is in line to run for the Dáil in the next general election, where the party hopes he will unseat Fine Gael TD Noel Rock, who he lost out to for the final seat in Dublin North West in 2016.Negotiations are continuing across the other Dublin councils ahead of their meetings on Friday, but coalitions on the councils are emerging.In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fine Gael, despite being the largest party on the authority with 13 out of the 40 seats, is set to be excluded from its majority coalition for the first time in 25 years.Fianna Fáil’s Shay Brennan is lined up to be mayor, with the majority coalition comprising Fianna Fáil, the Greens, Independents and the Social Democrats.Fianna Fáil councillor Eoghan O’Brien is also in line to be mayor in Fingal, with the arrangement set to be a combination of the Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, Labour and Independents.On South Dublin County Council, Fine Gael is likely to have Vicki Casserly as the first mayor of the council’s term, with Fianna Fáil’s Trevor Gilligan her deputy in a majority grouping combined of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and Independents.Full results and in depth analysis of the local elections"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3917502.1559853432!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord population of doonbeg aren t forelock tuggers cap doffers or eejits","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Donald Trump  seated beside his wife Melania and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders  in the restaurant at his hotel and golf resort in Doonbeg on Thursday evening.   Photograph: Stephen KearonThe Post Office in Doonbeg closed last October.It didn’t command international attention or trouble the national headlines. But it was a big loss to the village. The older people would come in on pension day and there’d be a good buzz around the place. Now, Friday is the same as any other day with most of the pubs staying closed until the evening time.This is not a major story, just a familiar one in many small towns and villages around the country. Keeping these communities alive is hard going.Doonbeg is lucky, though. And that’s down to the Trump hotel and Golf resort and the employment opportunities it has given to the local area.When the TV satellite vans have moved out and the roaming herds of photographers and journalists have left for the next gig, the hotel will still be there, along with the jobs.So on Thursday, as villagers scrolled through their social media feeds and saw themselves labelled “gombeens” by people they never met, and restaurant owners found scathing reviews appearing on Tripadvisor from people who never visited, they laughed and got on with life in the same way they did before the president of the United States of America nearly came to town.Doonbeg was in recovery following the big party the Wednesday night when Eric and Donál Óg Trump called into every pub to mark their father’s arrival in his eponymous hotel. They pulled pints (badly) and put on a good-humoured show for the crowd. They exaggerated the depth of love they believe Ireland and Doonbeg has for them and their father. They splashed the cash and called for drinks on the house, in every house they visited.The local parish priest arrived on the scene and presented them with a painting. There were lots of flags.Scenes from their exuberant progress from hostelry to hostelry upset an awful lot of people.Tiny populationThe population of Doonbeg is tiny. Fewer than 300 people. They aren’t forelock tuggers or cap doffers or eejits. The Trump brothers, Eric in particular, are not strangers to the village. Wednesday was not their first time in those pubs.Strip out the journalists and news crews and the crowd welcoming them would have been small.The village is adorned with some red white and blue bunting, and some of the green white and orange variety too. But it’s a bit sparse. There is the odd American flag about, but it isn’t hanging from the top window of houses and there aren’t any special signs welcoming Donald Trump to the neighbourhood.But his company is a valued employer, people don’t speak ill of the Trump hotel business. Of course they would give the Trump boys a big welcome and there would have been one for president Trump too, had he materialised.The appearance by the two lads fuelled speculation that they were sussing out the territory in advance of a visitation by their father. The happy images of people cheering them to the rafters as céilí dancers spun around in the street and pints of stout were flying out of the pubs would look well back home.Now, if only it could be replicated for the president.All day, Doonbeg was a town in suspense. Streets deserted, apart from hordes of media people and the same amount of Garda officers cooling their heels in the sunshine. Busloads of gardaí went up and down the Quilty Road, which was closed off to the public.Hiding from CNNAll day, the photographers waited. They photographed a man driving a cart with shire horses. They photographed a garda petting the horses. They photographed any publican they could find.We went in to talk to one landlord who wasn’t keen to come to the door. “I’m trying to hide from CNN. They have me persecuted.”Then a man wearing a Vietnam Veteran cap materialised in Tubridy’s bar to the immense relief of the journalists who dutifully recorded his utterances. “I absolutely love Trump,” he declared. And so on, and on.And a Mayo native from Boston appeared who is “an original member of the club” and who, on Wednesday night “met the whole crowd” in the hotel. Except Donald.Back at the small café, sticks of Doonbeg rock were snapped up by visitors – a euro each, six for a fiver.A local told us that some of the Garda sub-aqua team treated a few of their land based colleagues to a trip in the rib out into Doughmore Bay. But the water was a bit choppy. “The lads were sick as dogs.”As the hours slowly passed it was beginning to look like this would be the greatest danger the gardaí would find themselves in during Trump’s visit. A large communications mast attached to a cherry-picker was stationed at the entrance to the village with a very bored man wearing a laminated ID minding it.The last number of weeks have been a triumph of marketing for the Trump brand, but Doonbeg sur Diageo is a marketing haven for Guinness. Every outside wall is emblazoned with the firm’s retro livery.VisitationAnd still, everyone waited and wondered if there might yet be A Visitation. The Garda Public Order unit did a few sweeps of the Main Street. Secret service operatives were spotted in around the back of Tubridy’s pub while a clatter of them were seen entering Morrissey’s bar and restaurant.They only went in to have their dinner.The proprietor, Hugh McNally, had a pristine tricolour folded up and resting on a chair in reception. His dog Pepper – she rules the roost – was away being spoiled at another location. Was this a sign?In the pub, RTÉ’s Brian O’Donovan did his thing from the picturesque riverbank beside Morrissey’s. The room fell silent when he mentioned speculation mounting over a Visitation. But then again, it could be “fake news”. Everyone cheered.A photograph was tweeted showing Trump eating his dinner in his hotel restaurant with the 18 green in the background and the tomato sauce in the foreground.Back in the village, hopes were beginning to fade.Local man Brian Heppell – twenty years in the place, married a woman whose father was from Kilrush but she “ran away with the lead singer of a band” – was not particularly interested in seeing Donald Trump, should he visit.“I’ll think about it and see how I feel – depends on the weather.”Brian is originally from Windsor in the UK and recalled seeing a Royal procession many years ago.“Everyone was peering into this Rolls Royce when it passed. And it turned out to be the Queen mother. We got an absolutely glorious smile and wave from her. It was absolutely genuine and I’ll never forget it. Now, if Donald waved to me, I don’t thing it would have quite the same effect.”The hotel is a good thing for Doonbeg, he says. Only for it, young people who are now living locally would be rearing their families in America or Australia.The photographers stuck it out, but it looked like the most famous person to visit the village (and be universally loved there) continues to be the tremendously tremendous Marty Morrissey.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3917425.1559849175!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"commons cannot be suspended to achieve no deal brexit says bercow","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJohn Bercow: ‘Parliament will not be evacuated from the centre stage of the decision-making process.’ Photograph: Dan KitwoodGettyHouse of Commons speaker John Bercow has warned Conservative leadership candidates they will not be able to suspend parliament to stop MPs from blocking a no-deal Brexit. Mr Bercow was speaking after former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab refused to rule out proroguing parliament to ensure that the UK leaves the European Union on October 31st.“Parliament will not be evacuated from the centre stage of the decision-making process on this important matter. That simply is not going to happen, it’s just so blindly obvious it almost doesn’t need to be stated,” Mr Bercow told the Commons on Thursday.Other candidates condemned Mr Raab, who is competing with Boris Johnson for the support of hardline Brexiteers and has promised to take Britain out of the EU on schedule, with or without a deal. International development secretary Rory Stewart said the idea of proroguing parliament was “as disturbing as it is ludicrous”, and health secretary Matt Hancock wrote to all other candidates calling on them to rule it out.“To suspend parliament explicitly to pursue a course of action against its wishes is not a serious policy of a prime minister in the 21st century. What kind of message would this send around the world about our values when so many have given so much for the rights of democratic freedom?” Mr Hancock said.Tory leadershipTheresa May will resign as Conservative party leader on Friday but will remain acting leader and prime minister until her successor is chosen. Nominations close next Monday, with hustings before the backbench 1922 Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday and the first round of voting on Thursday.The committee has gone to great lengths to prevent voter fraud, insisting that MPs show their parliamentary pass to vote and printing ballot papers for each round on a different-coloured paper, with the colour decided the night before each ballot. The committee’s acting joint chairs, Charles Walker and Cheryl Gillan, set out a timetable on Thursday that allows for up to six ballots for MPs to choose two candidates to go before the entire party membership.Mr Walker said the committee wanted to avoid a repeat of the contest in 2016 when party members were not involved because Andrea Leadsom withdrew, leaving Mrs May as the sole remaining candidate.“The expectation is that if they are in the final two, they will put themselves through the membership hustings. We’ve had a conversation with those who have indicated they are going to put their papers in. There is a great recognition across the parliamentary party that this does need to go to the membership this time. Potential candidates are fully aware of that and hopefully relishing the prospect,” he said.Eleven candidates remain in the race after two withdrew this week but candidates need the support of at least eight MPs to get on to the ballot. The party hopes to have a new leader in place in the week beginning July 22nd."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3915844.1559752326!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"janan ganesh the big chinese elephant in the uk us honeymoon suite","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS President Donald Trump and Britain’s prime minister Theresa May during a dinner at Winfield House on Tuesday. The question of the tech giant Huawei came up during Trump’s state visit to the UK. Photograph: Chris JacksonAFPGetty ImagesA populist is someone who abhors the metropolis and demands its respect. According to the cultural right, big cities are teetering Babels, lawless and ghettoised, but also wealth-hoarding success stories that look down at the conservative provinces. “You crammed and besieged losers,” this Tom Wolfe-ish attitude to urbanites seems to say, “we are just as good as you.”All of which helps to explain why some British populists back a foreign president over the mayor of their own liberal capital. The running tiff between Donald Trump and Sadiq Khan is modern politics – closed versus open – in miniature.But there is more behind the courtship of the visiting president than that. There is foreign policy at work. The British right sees the US as a natural companion in a post-Brexit world. If a no-deal Brexit puts the UK out in the European cold, it hopes to warm its hands on the fire of a fast-growing America.That hope should be checked. British conservatives have been misreading American ones since Dwight Eisenhower declined to look away as the Suez Canal was summarily invaded. Yes, there is a promising bonhomie between Trump and Boris Johnson, the former UK foreign secretary. And the US right cherishes the nation state, not the EU, as the last word in human organisation. Both countries also talk an excellent game about a bilateral trade deal.Divergent interestsThey just happen to have ergent interests on the largest question of the century, that’s all. Even before Brexit, the UK viewed China as a commercial opportunity. Its disposition will have to become even warmer once it loses full membership of its own continental trading bloc. It is not in a position to pick and choose its economic friends.All the while, the US is moving in the opposite direction twice as fast. It is actually more suspicious of China than it was when it began its tariff campaign a year ago. What could then have been explained away as one quixotic president’s attempt to secure better trading terms has become a wider confrontation.Trump’s views have caught on in formerly laissez-faire boardrooms and in once-orthodox Washington symposia. To call it a consensus is a leap. Some eminent Americans hope to rattle China a bit and leave it at that. Others aspire to nothing less than the eventual decoupling of the two economies. But the general direction of US thought, and its incompatibility with the UK’s Chinese interests, is unmistakable. And possibly intractable.Odd partnershipIf this seems a more theoretical than actual problem, then look to the recent past for a case study. In 2015, when London signed up to the Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Washington chafed at this “constant accommodation” of China. And that was under the Barack Obama administration. Imagine a replay under Trump or another populist.Because Britain has long been out of the superpower business, the rise of China has no implications for its own status. Its economic interests and its foreign policy can be almost the same thing. The US is in a very different predicament. It is a ruling power facing demotion by (in its mind) a revisionist one. Its foreign policy has to go beyond entrepreneurial nimbleness.No doubt, close partners can bicker over one thing while remaining in broad concert. But it is an odd partnership that contains such opposing views on quite so important a third party. As time wears on, this strategic tension cannot be glossed over with the usual grammar of UK-US meetings: the one-sided flattery, the talk of “cousins” that belies the non-British ancestry of even most white Americans.This week’s state visit had its stresses. The question of the tech giant Huawei, which the two countries view with differing levels of suspicion, came up. Such wedge questions are likelier to multiply than to recede over the years.Ultra-intimateSingapore, Germany, Australia, Brazil: lots of countries hope not to have to choose between the US and China. But the UK plan – to be ultra-intimate with the one while profiting from the other – is another order of ambition.That British conservatives put so much hope in Trump, and found Obama’s anglophilia so wanting, only defeats their own argument. The “special” relationship, it seems, is a transcendent fact of the world, as immutable as force equals mass times acceleration, and yet entirely dependent on whoever is in the White House at any given moment.Well, for now, that occupant is Donald Trump. Sympathy for Brexit is certainly one part of his worldview. But mistrust of China is much the larger. It is not a mistrust all countries can afford."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeD-Day commemorations: Prince Charles says today is \u0026#39probably last chance to pay everlasting respect\u0026#39 to veterans - latest updatesFantasising about killing your boss is normal, leading psychologist says Biodegradable plastic is misleading because most will not break down in compost heaps, UCL scientists sayBoris Johnson best placed Tory candidate to challenge Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn, poll findsBrexit Party has 3,000 applications from wannabe MPs wanting to fight the next general election Matt Hancock vows to \u0026#39save\u0026#39 high street with tax cut for small retailers funded by new Amazon taxComment: The next Tory leader will owe far more to Cameron than ThatcherLimit of human endurance discovered by Duke University and pregnancy is very close to maximum\u0026#39Most Isil fighters are from Saudi Arabia\u0026#39: Qatari Sheikh hits back over regional blockade in rare interviewEastEnders, the return of Zammo, review: a cheeky, cheery but all-too-brief Grange Hill cameoJeremy Corbyn ally used external email address to intervene over anti-Semitism caseSecond yellow vest protester charged with harassing Anna SoubryKenneth Noye has pulled the wool over parole board\u0026#39s eyes, says policeman who helped bring killer to justiceMadonna claims Harvey Weinstein \u0026#39crossed lines and boundaries\u0026#39 when she worked with himFailed NHS trust faces third inquiry to investigate patient deathsSenior policeman refuses to apologise to journalists accused of stealing confidential documents Comment: The roaring success of Trump\u0026#39s state visit proves the Special Relationship is alive and wellJoe Biden beats Donald Trump in Texas poll as he breaks from Democratic party line on abortionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

In June 1944, as a Switchboard Operator recently trained in the new technology of VHF radio, 17-year-old Marie Scott practically skipped down all 350 of them, deep into the tunnels underneath the cliffs of Fort Southwick.Living, working and sleeping in the tunnels was not very pleasant: eight-hour watches in a 24-hour duty, then off for a day. For the staff of the Naval Command headquarters just outside Portsmouth, the fetid air and lack of natural light underground meant the steps provided welcome exercise on their way back to the surface.Day and night meant nothing to Marie and her colleagues: the wireless operators, plotters, planners and telegraphists from across the services, who sat at their stations in the windowless offices or slept in small, cramped rooms on three-tier bunks.Even so, they knew their hardships were nothing compared to the men they would be speaking to on the other end of their wireless sets. They’d been informed on June 4 that a big operation was planned for the next day, but hadn’t been told why a 24-hour delay meant that it would now be starting on the sixth.Marie Scott at Southwick House, Portsmouth. She was a 17-year-old switchboard operator on D-DayWhatever was happening up there on the surface, in the air and on the sea off the south coast of Britain, the nine WAAFs, Wrens and Auxiliary Territorial Service personnel in Marie’s section knew this was no rehearsal it was the real thing.“I grew up on that day,” Mrs Scott says. “I became aware of the reality of war.”General Dwight D Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of Allied Expeditionary Forces in Europe, had arrived in Southwick House on June 2 to establish his headquarters for the invasion. Chosen because of its proximity to the port, and to the underground naval command headquarters dug into the cliffs, Southwick House had been requisitioned for the Royal Navy’s navigation school earlier in the war.The date for D-Day was dictated by the weather. With a full moon and suitable tide, the period June 4 to 7 was optimal, with a few days from the 18th as Plan B.If they didn’t go in June, the next suitable tide was not until September and by then the secret would have undoubtedly slipped out. The Germans knew an invasion was coming - the mass of Allied vehicles, manpower and ships meant it was only a matter of time - but they didn’t know where, and they didn’t know when.But there was a problem. The British and American meteorologists had different ways of doing things and couldn’t agree on the most suitable date. The situation was not helped by the fact that James Stagg, Eisenhower’s chief weather adviser and a civilian later given the notional rank of Group Captain in the RAF so as to be more readily accepted by the military, was actually a geophysicist.An intense rivalry had developed between him and the weathermen. Meteorology at this time was more art than science and there hadn’t been any significant advances in the subject since the First World War.  On June 4 Stagg recommended to Eisenhower that the weather was so bad, with high wind and cloud cover, that D-Day, planned for June 5, should be postponed.Eisenhower asked his component commanders their view. “Chancey,” said Air Chief Marshal Leigh Mallory, the air commander. “Do-able but risky” thought Sir Arthur Tedder, Eisenhower’s deputy. General Montgomery, the overall ground force commander, in charge of all British, American and Canadian troops (and later Polish forces) was unequivocal in his belief they should launch.Eisenhower made his decision. “OK, we’ll go,” he said to Stagg. A signal sent to London and Washington stated ‘Halcyon plus five’ (Halcyon being the code word for June 1). The invasion was on.Despite knowing an attack was coming, the remarkable success of Operation Fortitude, under General George Patton’s First US Army Group, had convinced the Germans that any attack in Normandy would be just a ersion for the main assault at Pas-de-Calais.General Patton was considered by the Germans to be the best allied general and therefore certain to be the commander of the coming invasion. He based himself in Kent, with real soldiers bolstered by dummy equipment available for the eyes of German intelligence.Operation Fortitude worked so well that even after D-Day the Germans held many of their best troops in the Calais area expecting a second invasion.Further afield Britain’s secret agents, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), were doing their bit. In some areas, the Germans were using carrier pigeons to send messages. The SOE put birds trained to fly towards Britain in German army pigeon lofts so the messages were delayed or simply disappeared. The French resistance blew up the radio land lines, to force the Germans to use other means of communication which, with Enigma cracked, enabled the Allies to listen in.Pigeons had a vital role in the war Dummy paratroopers were dropped across Seine-Maritime, Calvados and Manche and an SAS team, parachuted into the Cotentin peninsula five miles west of Saint-Lo, installed loudspeakers to play combat noises, including explosions and the sound of soldiers swearing.  The RAF’s 617 Squadron - made famous by the Dambusters raid in 1943 - dropped strips of metal foil known as ‘window’ miles away from Normandy. German radar operators were fooled into thinking they were seeing an approaching naval fleet, where in fact there was none.The deception plan was working. Just as well, there was no way now of stopping the vast armada of ships and aircraft departing on the biggest operation of its kind ever mounted what Eisenhower later called “the great crusade”.Having made his decision, Eisenhower was rendered temporarily powerless as the massive machine of war stirred into action.On the afternoon of June 5, he had been driven to Greenham Common to visit the troops of the 101st Airborne Division, a force expected to have one in every two men killed, wounded or captured. He handed out cigarettes and talked to them about fly fishing a photo from the time captures him with hands aloft, as if explaining how to cast.Eisenhower gives the order of the day to US paratroopers on June 6, 1944 Returning to Southwick House he stood on the ridge to watch the deployment. It was said to be the only time he showed emotion a certain moisture around the eyes. New challenges would face him in the future, but nothing ever again on the scale of D-Day.Just after midnight on June 6, paratroopers from the British 6th Airborne Division, the first of 23,400 airborne troops, jumped into Normandy. The German artillery battery at Merville needed to be silenced before it could fire on to the beaches where British and Canadian forces were due to land a few hours later. Two bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne were to be seized to prevent German reinforcements arriving from Calais.The glider-borne assault on the bridges was so successful - 15 minutes from landing to capture - they were renamed Pegasus and Horsa Bridges, after the emblem of British airborne forces and the gliders they had flown in on.Lieutenant Herbert Denham ‘Den’ Brotheridge, killed just after midnight on the 6th while leading a charge to seize Pegasus Bridge, was the first allied soldier killed on D-Day.Pegasus Bridge: No 1 glider (in background) piloted by Jim Wallwork landed within feet of the planned targetAt 02:40 Field Marshal von Runstedt, commander of the German Army in France, was told of fighting in Normandy, but still believed the main invasion would be at Pas-de-Calais.Although the potent 21st Panzer Division was available, Hitler was asleep at Berchtesgaden and his staff were too nervous to wake him up to order the reinforcements, as they still thought the fighting was a ersionary raid.It was another two hours before Von Runstedt ordered the 12th SS Panzer Division into action, but his decision was rescinded at 06:30 by General Jodl at the Armed Forces High Command, who still wanted to wait for Hitler to wake up.Assault routes into Normandy - DDAYIn the early hours of June 6, the invasion fleet arrived at the assembly point south of the Isle of Wight called Area Z - better known as Piccadilly Circus - and passed through a lane cleared in the German minefield which extended to Norway. It then turned south, towards the Normandy beaches.At 04:30, an hour after the assault troops had started cross-decking into the landing craft far out in the English Channel, struggling to descend the nets into vessels that were pitching uncertainly below them, and just as Von Runstedt was ordering the Panzer reinforcements, two British X-class midget submarines surfaced off the Normandy coast.For the preceding two days, each craft and their five-man crew had sat silently, waiting for the invasion. Their mission: erect 18-foot telescopic masts equipped with navigation lights and radio beacons to guide British and Canadian landing craft to the beaches.Canadian soldiers from 9th Brigade land with their bicycles at Juno Beach in Bernieres-sur-Mer on D-DayAs H-Hour approached, the time of the ground invasion, rocket launcher barges started firing salvoes onto the beaches in a bid to clear the minefields. On Gold, Juno and Sword beaches in the British sector, where 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadian soldiers were to land, 20,000 rockets blasted the sand, with a similar number fired at Utah and Omaha beaches in the American sector, where 73,000 US troops would be arriving shortly.  However, Forward Observers out at sea struggled to see through the clouds of smoke and brick dust being thrown up from the coast by the naval gunfire. Consequently, much ammunition was wasted on targets randomly picked off the map. As the landing craft approached the beaches, smelling of diesel, sweat and vomit, the men geared themselves for the imminent assault unaware that much of the German coastal defence remained intact.Security around the operation had been rigid. The secret map board in Southwick House, depicting the coasts of England and Normandy and which showed all the locations of the deployed forces, covered an entire wall.Produced by carpenters at Chad Valley toys in Birmingham, the section was one small part of a larger piece that had been ordered, showing Britain and the entire European coastline from Norway to Spain.When the carpenters had erected the section they commented that the invasion was obviously planned for Normandy. “Yes,” came the answer, “and you’re going to jail.”Allowed to do odd jobs around the house by day, the two men were locked up each night. They had only planned to stay for the weekend but were kept at Southwick House until September. History does not record what they told their wives upon their return.Not even the tea ladies were allowed in. One Wren, Marsi Taylor (known as Aunt Marsi),  had worked in the headquarters throughout the war but had never seen the map room before visiting in 2014.Two bizarre security incidents had particularly concerned the authorities and show how seriously efforts to deny the plan’s discovery by German spies had been taken.In early 1944 codewords related to D-Day were revealed in the ’s crossword puzzle: Gold and Sword were dismissed as commonly-used crossword answers, but then more exotic words started to appear.On May 22 came the clue ‘Red Indian on the Missouri (5)’. The answer: Omaha, codename for the beach to be taken by the 1st US Assault Division. Then, on May 27, came Overlord, the name for the entire Normandy campaign. Coincidence? Perhaps.But on May 30 came Mulberry (the floating harbours used in the landings) and on June 1 the solution for 15 down was Neptune (the naval assaults onto the beaches). Alarm bells rang and MI5 visited Leonard Dawe, the ’s crossword compiler, who later said “they made me sweat”.Troops landing on D-Day at Sword beach. The picture was taken from a photo reconnaissance Mustang aircraft of II (Army Cooperation) SquadronThe second case involved Helen Duncan, a spiritualist and clairvoyant. She was the celebrity mystic of her day and had supposedly given seances to King George VI and Churchill. She was also a con artist who used to spit out fluid claiming it was ectoplasm, while her husband rattled the windows.She claimed she could talk to the dead through the spirit of an Able Seaman who had been on HMS Barham, a battleship sunk in the Meditaerranean with the loss of 861 men. The Admiralty was concerned as it had not released the details of HMS Barham’s loss.In the febrile and paranoid security atmosphere ahead of D-Day, Duncan was put under surveillance and later arrested after a seance attended by two superstitious naval officers who thought she might reveal the secrets of the imminent invasion. She was acquitted of fraud but found guilty of witchcraft under the 1735 Witchcraft Act and sentenced to nine months in Holloway prison.D-Day 75 years on | Read moreAt 06:30 US troops from the 1st and 29th Divisions landed over a four-mile front at Omaha beach. The US 4th Division put ashore the first of 23,250 men on Utah beach at the same time.Immediately there were problems at Omaha. Many landing craft missed their targets or were swamped in the choppy seas. Of the 29 Duplex Drive tanks (modified Shermans with floats) in the first wave, 27 sank. German resistance - from the 352nd Infantry Division - was stronger than anticipated.On one landing craft a flamethrower operator had been hit and his weapon exploded, blasting him into the sea and spewing blazing fuel over the decks. The vessel caught fire and continued burning all day, periodically lit up again by detonations from exploding 20mm Oerlikon ammunition.At 07:25 the British 3rd Division landed at Sword beach, intending to take the town of Caen and the Carpiquet aerodrome by nightfall. The seizure of the La Breche strongpoint covering the beach took three hours and cost the South Lancashires 107 men killed. On one part of the beach a solitary French girl was seen wading through the surf to help wounded men out of the water.Five minutes after Sword, Gold beach was assaulted by the British 50th Division who must hold the position to allow the two Mulberry harbours - vast prefabricated structures vital for offloading the two million troops and critical supplies - to be established.Marie Scott, manning her VHF Switchboard in Fort Southwick, was shocked when the soldiers on the beaches started radioing back. “When they passed their message you could hear gunfire, cannon fire, all the sounds of war,” she said.“Suddenly you realised that this was the reality of war. Men were dying there. And at 17, and being rather naive, I don’t think it had fully registered, until the moment I got the first message back and could hear the sounds of war.”British troops take positions on Sword beachAfter hours without a decision, and with Hitler still asleep, at 07:40 General Edgar Feuchtinger unilaterally ordered his 21st Panzer Division to reinforce the eastern beaches. Hitler woke up an hour and a half later, but regarded the news from Normandy as excellent, still thinking - thanks to Operation Fortitude\u0027s chain of deceptions - that the morning\u0027s events were a cover for the real invasion at Pas-de-Calais.The assault on Utah progressed well, even though the tide had taken the landing craft a mile south of their intended positions. Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr, the 56-year-old son of the former president, was in the first wave.Meanwhile, wading towards Sword beach, in a bid to rally the men of 1st Special Service Brigade, Piper Bill Millin struck up Hieland Laddie as his Cameron tartan floated around him. The man behind him was hit and sank, but Millin kept going. Once ashore he did not run, but walked up and down the beach, blasting out a series of tunes, including The Road to the Isles. German prisoners later admitted that they had not attempted to shoot him because they thought he had lost his mind.Piper Bill Millin strikes up Blue Bonnets as 1st SS Brigade Commandos wade ashore at Ouistreham on Sword beachThe 3rd Canadian Infantry Division landed at Juno beach at 07:45, having had H-Hour delayed by 10 minutes due to rough seas. But even then some craft were late. As a result, many hit obstacles submerged by the tide and the coxswains could do little to prevent the landing craft becoming entangled. The Engineers struggled to clear a path and almost a third of the vessels were destroyed by mines. They took heavy casualties.Likewise, the situation at Omaha was becoming desperate. Vehicles were stuck in the deep water and wounded men on the beach were drowning as the tide came in. General Bradley, commander of the US First Army and in charge of the assaults on Omaha and Utah, watched the chaos from the cruiser the USS Augusta. He came close to stopping the operation and considered erting troops from Utah.Pinned down on Omaha, Colonel George Taylor, commander of the US 16th Infantry Regiment, shouted to his men: “Two sorts of people are going to stay on this beach, those who are dead and those who are going to die. Let’s get the hell out of here!” There were hundreds of bodies on the beach and floating in the water. Commonwealth personnel, nearly all British and Canadian, outnumbered the Americans on D-Day. Of the 156,000 men landed in France on June 6, 73,000 were American, and 83,000 were British and Canadian, while the Commonwealth naval contingent was twice that of the Americans. The Germans were formidable opponents, and by this stage of the war the British Armed Forces were tired, having been fighting for nearly five years. The Americans wanted to get the job done and some questioned why it was taking Britain so long. But in truth the country was almost exhausted and close to bankruptcy.In late 1943 the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, had told Churchill that Britain was unable to replace any battle casualties. Consequently, Montgomery was fighting the war with the Army he had, rather than the one he wanted, and morale was fragile. He was criticised after the war for excessive caution, but the priority at the time was to preserve his fighting power. He had been told by Churchill to win well and sufficient for Britain to maintain her world power status.Ron Smith was a 19-year-old electrical technician on Landing Craft Tank 947 when he left Gosport early on D-Day. He thought at first it was another rehearsal, like he was used to in Scotland, but the skipper said they were going to France instead. “Do we need a passport?” asked one of the crew.The craft landed on Sword beach at 07:30, closed up, at action stations, carrying six 80-tonne Churchill tanks, with a rocket ship behind Ron blasting the mines on the beach. “I don’t reckon a whelk could have survived on that beach,” he said.Ron Smith, who was on landing Craft Tank 947 which was sunk by shellfireRon’s landing craft was hit by shellfire. The third tank was immobilised, blocking the exit ramp, and the torpedoes on the landing craft exploded, killing a number of men on board. They managed to get off the beach but the craft was partly submerged, due to the damaged tank on the ramp, and was mistaken for a submarine on their way back to Portsmouth.Despite the shock of the action Ron, now 94, was impressed with the whole operation. “It was beautifully organised,” he said, “if you can say that in a war.”Back in Eisenhower’s headquarters at Southwick House there was a frenetic atmosphere. The map room was a hive of activity and noise, with telegrams coming in, phones ringing and signals presented to staff officers. Along one wall a huge gantry seated service men and women reporting the progress of the landings. The room was enveloped in a fug of cigarette smoke.People rushed to put things on the map - and remove them. Sybil Parker, a Wren working in the headquarters, had a Canadian boyfriend called Captain James Morley. Sybil watched as the small wooden marker denoting his ship was removed from the map board after being hit by enemy fire. She found out 10 weeks later that he had been killed on D-Day at Juno beach.Sybil Parker only learned her beloved had died when his ship was removed from the big map In the middle of it all was Eisenhower. Under huge stress, he ate little and slept even less, surviving on five packets of cigarettes a day and a lot of coffee.  Billetted in tents in the grounds of Southwick House, Eisenhower relaxed by reading cheap cowboy books and was known to have a volcanic temper that disappeared as quickly as it had flared.With his political master, Roosevelt, 3,000 miles away in Washington, Eisenhower was under great pressure from Churchill. Repeatedly dragged to Chequers, he was served tepid Irish stew, for which he developed a lifelong aversion, and had to endure Churchill’s rambling, alcohol-fuelled monologues.Churchill could be a “terrible pest” in the words of Field Marshal Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff. He had turned up at Southwick House unannounced on May 3 with General Charles de Gaulle. His force of nature character was unwelcome, as was his earlier insistence that the British and Canadian beaches should be called Goldfish, Jellyfish and Swordfish. He was told men shouldn’t have to die on a beach called Jellyfish. It was changed to Juno and fish was dropped from the objective names.  The first tanks enter Sword Beach, near Ouistreham Churchill’s extraordinary ability to lead was beyond question, but he did have one particularly concerning trait: a desire to be in the thick of the action. A soldier at heart, he was never entirely happy allowing the admirals, generals and air marshals a free hand and often wanted to see things for himself.His insistence on being able to watch the beach assaults for himself aboard HMS Belfast  and then set foot on the French coast presented Eisenhower with one of his more delicate diplomatic conundrums. He elected to speak to Alan Lascelles, Private Secretary to King George VI, who, in turn, took the matter to the Monarch.Winston Churchill visiting the Normandy landing beaches in France with Field Marshal Montgomery the month after D-DayThe King wrote a letter to Churchill. It read: My Dear Winston, I want to make one more appeal to you not to go to sea on D-Day. Please consider my own position. I am a younger man than you. I am a sailor and as King I am the head of all three services. There is nothing I would like better than to go to sea, although I have agreed to stay at home. Is it fair that you should then do exactly what I should have liked to do myself?He went on:  You will see very little but you will be at considerable risk. You will be inaccessible at a critical time when vital decisions might have to be taken. However unobtrusive you may be, your very presence on board is bound to be a very heavy additional responsibility to the Admiral and Captain...Churchill stayed at home.De Gaulle likewise was a prickly house guest. He had just arrived from Algiers and was livid to be told about the invasion - which his staff had had no part in planning - and that Eisenhower, rather than he, was to run a provisional government in France.That the US Treasury had been printing ‘French occupation dollars’ was a further point of tension. De Gaulle, already deeply suspicious of what he saw as an Anglo-Saxon plot to marginalise France, objected to the term ‘occupation’.It was at this point Eisenhower’s true greatness shone through. He had the ability to calm things down and was the embodiment of a coalition soldier, able to hold together a very fractious group.Eisenhower had walked in the gardens of Southwick House with De Gaulle. They smoked, and the American let the Frenchman, whom he outranked by three stars, harangue him about the plan. In an inspired moment, Eisenhower tuned and said “General, do you have any further advice for me?”De Gaulle, acknowledging Eisenhower’s patience and position, then said “Mon General, if I were you I would delay no further” and he left. Churchill departed also, in a huff because he had not been allowed to interfere in any way. He said to the staff “good luck and God speed, but I’ve been told not to talk to you,” before storming off.By early afternoon Juno, Sword, Gold and Utah beaches were largely stable and the situation at Omaha was improving, although many hours behind schedule. Lord Lovat and his Commandos, accompanied by piper Bill Millin, had relieved Major John Howard and the 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry at the Bénouville bridges. Georges Gondrée, proprietor of the Café Gondreé, approached with champagne for Lovat. He was waved away with the words: I\u0027m working.The forces of 50th Division had pushed inland four miles from Gold beach towards the town of Creully and 47 Commando Royal Marines had taken Port-en-Bessin to close the gap with the US forces at Omaha. Caen, home to 60,000 civilians, was bombed at 13:30 by over 70 B-24s of the 2nd Bombardment Division in an attempt to cut German communication lines. Despite a leaflet drop over the town earlier, warning civilians of an Allied air attack, there were many casualties.Winston Churchill talking to British and Canadian troops in Caen, in July 1944  At 15:00  the first sections of two massive artificial harbours code-named Mulberry headed across the Channel. Built of concrete and steel they were critical in the resupply of the Allied forces. It was not until 20:55 that the town of Arromanches, south of Gold beach, was captured, enabling the safe deployment of the Mulberry harbours. Reinforcements started to arrive by glider in the evening. Operation Mallard launched 250 gliders, with RAF fighter escort, in support of the British 6th Airborne Division. Denzil Cooper, then a 23-year-old Sergeant in the Glider Pilot Regiment, flew the third aircraft into Ranville at 21:00, towed behind an Albemarle. Horsa gliders were designed so that the tail could be detached once on the ground, for the easy deployment of the vehicles or men inside.Approaching Ranville in attack formation, he saw the tail of a neighbouring glider suddenly drop off, causing the aircraft to plummet to the ground. “I thought, hmm, that’s the end of them,” he said.Aerial view of pieces of the Mulberry Harbour at Arromanches, built to help troops and machinery onto the beach By the end of the day the 159,000 Allied troops, marines, airmen and naval personnel ashore had successfully established four sizeable beachheads. The invasion front remained vulnerable to German counter-attack, and there was still terrible fighting ahead, but a crucial step had been taken towards liberating Europe.Professor Richard Holmes said of the Normandy campaign: “The forces of a mighty coalition had entered the continent of Europe and mistakes not withstanding, struck a telling blow at its occupiers. They deserve our gratitude.”A month after D-Day, on the afternoon of July 11, Eisenhower found a handwritten note inside his wallet. It had been written on June 5 as he was driven to Greenham Common to visit the 101st Airborne Division.He had prepared the note in case the landings were repulsed and the operation had failed, in a bid to shield his staff from criticism.   The note said: Our landings in the Cherbourg and Le Havre area failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.As the longest day - as D-Day became known - drew to a close 4,413 Allied soldiers were dead. German losses are thought to be between 4,000 and 9,000. The whole Normandy campaign lasted 77 days (Montgomery had expected 90) and resulted in the destruction of the German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army.In total 209,672 Allied soldiers were killed, wounded or listed as missing. This casualty rate, including the Germans and civilians, was 6,674 killed a day, each day of the Normandy campaign- a rate that exceeds the attrition rate of Verdun, the Somme and Passchendaele during World War One. An infantry Platoon Commander had a one-in-seven chance of surviving longer than two weeks.Casualties and Deaths - DDAYMarie Scott is now 92, and on June 5, 2019 will be presented with the Legion d’honneur, France’s highest award, as a mark of the respect France continues to have for the men and women who helped liberate the country.Mrs Scott says the significance of D-Day dawned on her only in retrospect. “To have been awarded the Legion d’honneur was remarkable, almost unbelievable, truly overwhelming.“But in comparison to the men who landed on the beaches and were injured or died, there is no comparison.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

by boat and even by parachute. They came to pay their respects to their fallen brothers.Britain\u0027s future King took part in a number of events around Normandy to mark the anniversary, and said: I remember the last time we were there, I will never forget the determination that they still exude by being there. Being at the cemeteries and being at the commemorations. They always remember their comrades and their friends and the people they had to leave behind. This country lost countless special people and we owe it to them and their families to go on commemorating this.Asked whether this 75th anniversary would be particularly poignant, he added: It\u0027s probably the last chance to pay everlasting respect to these remarkable people who wanted above all to do their duty.Earlier, Theresa May addressed the D-Day veterans at a commemoration ceremony in Ver-sur-Mer, and closing her emotionally-charged speech said: Here in Normandy, the names of those British men and women who lost their lives will forever sit across The Channel from their homeland.  We\u0027ll always remember their courage and conviction. And to the veterans that are here today - I want to say the only two words I can: Thank you.World War II reenactors stand on Omaha Beach, in Normandy, France, at dawn The British Normandy Memorial, funded by the Normandy Memorial Trust, is being built on a hillside in Ver-sur-Mer, overlooking Gold Beach, one of the key sites for British troops during the Normandy Landings.A sculpture created by David Williams-Ellis was unveiled marking the beginning of construction for the memorial.After the memorial inauguration, Mrs May, in one of her final official engagements as Conservative leader, joined veterans and the Prince of Wales at a cathedral service in Bayeux.The moving service saw veterans and religious leaders deliver speeches to honour those who made the ultimate sacrifice during the Second World War.D-Day 75th anniversary: The Portsmouth and Normandy celebrations, in picturesMany veterans flocked to the town of Arromanches for a series of events, which included a fly by performed by the Red Arrows.Later, Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt joined US Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe in laying wreaths on Juno Beach.The day began with a lone piper playing a lament on Port Winston signalling the minute the invasion began and the moment the first British soldier landed on Gold beach.Veterans then descended on the town square as part of a parade with Tobias Ellwood, the minister for Defence People and Veterans, and chief of Ministry of Defence general staff Mark Carleton-Smith among crowds.The day concluded with a fireworks show.Stay with us all day for live updates. You, the readers, have been sharing your memories of D-Day, and we have compiled them into this article, covering the build up to the allied push, the conflict itself, the home front, and the aftermath.\u0026#039It\u0026#039s a memory so clear, it\u0026#039s as if it were yesterday\u0026#039 - D-Day as told by  readersA six-year-old boy proudly wore his great-uncle\u0027s medals to Bayeux War Cemetery to mark 75 years since the D-Day landings.George Sayer, dressed in a suit and tie, visited the cemetery with 10 members of his family to honour uncle George.Due to wearing the medals, he was allowed to join veterans who walked the half a mile from a service at Bayeux Cathedral to the cemetery.His great-uncle, who was also called George Sayer, was in one of the first landing craft on Sword Beach at about 7.35am on June 6, 1944.Mr Sayer planned to come to mark the anniversary at Bayeux with his family but passed away about 18 months ago, aged 93.Six-year-old George Sayer paying tribute to his great uncle, who landed on Sword Beach on D-DayPat Sayer, George\u0027s Jnr\u0027s grandmother, said: We decided to come as a family - there were 11 of us here today - to pay our respects and honour Uncle George.Uncle George\u0027s son Kerry requested that little George wear his medals.George was in one of the first landing craft on Sword Beach, at about 7.35am on June 6 1944.He was in the Navy and was bringing troops over. He also spent time helping to build the Mulberry harbour at Arromanches.She added: We took him back to Sword Beach once. It was a beautiful sunny day.

Crouched beside one veteran, she asked him what his medals were for.One little boy was so awestruck at meeting a hero of the Second World War that he didn\u0027t want to let go of the soldier\u0027s hand as he went past in a wheelchair.Bernard Kempster, 88, was among the veterans who joined the procession through the town to loud applause from the hundreds of well wishers lining the streets of Arromanches. The former corporal in the Intelligence Corps said he had been moved by the members of the public of all ages who had thanked him for his service. “Quite a lot of people have been clapping us and shaking hands with us.

He writes:American D-Day veteran Jack Ewald, 94, from Suffolk Virginia gazed at the calm sea and sunlit Omaha beach below, which he said could not be more different than the atrocious conditions that faced Allied troops that day.“It’s pristine now. It was so bad and pitiful that day. Now it’s so beautiful,” said, in full view of the beach he scaled under German machine gun fire 75 years ago.Mr Ewald came back in 2010 and he said he wouldn’t have missed the 75th anniversary for the world. “It’s given me more energy than I’ve had in a decade,” he said.Some 4,400 Allied troops died on the first day of the landings, more than half at Omaha beach. Me Ewald was in the 115th infantry regiment.“I’m no hero, just a plain old guy like most of us,” he said beside his granddaughter Megan Forbes, 34.“We didn’t do anything special. We all protected each other. We knew we had to do it and we did it. There weren’t no hero business about it.”PFC Warren Goss, 94, landed with the first wave of soldiers on nearby Utah beach after a gruelling training programme in England and three days at sea.“Most people were seasick. We could hardly see land. The Germans could see us but we couldn’t see them. We didn’t know when a Higgins boat was hit it would sink and guys would drown, that we would be machine-gunned as soon as we opened up the front gate and the ramp,” he recalled.“I jumped off the side. I had water up to my chest and had to bounce in, bounce in. My job was to lay down covering fire for the engineers so they could clear that beach. They blew up the beach wall and did a good job. Our job was to keep the Germans pinned down so they could work. He remained in Normandy for a month before fighting all the way over the eastern French border to Saarbrücken in Germany.The scene in Colleville-sur-Mer as soldiers walk on the beach during the D-Day celebrationsThere is still plenty to look forward to tonight, with celebrations set to continue long into the evening.

Well worth reading properly.Len Fox, the veteran who sang part of We\u0027ll Meet Again during the remembrance service in Arromanches, said it was a delight to take part.The 94-year-old, who lives in Norwich, landed in the town on D-Day with the 53rd Welsh Division as a dispatch rider.He said: Being here for the anniversary is my way of paying back a little to my comrades who didn\u0027t make it.I wasn\u0027t a hero, I was a frightened 19-year-old. They were the brave heroes.I think it has been a wonderful day and I loved signing in the service - it was very moving.Mr Fox also laid a wreath with his grand-daughter Sally Brooks.Len Fox, second from the left, sang part of We\u0026#39ll Meet Again at the Arromanches serviceGeorgina Stubbs, a Press Association reporter in St Petersburg, writes:Vladimir Putin has brushed off his lack of an invite to the commemorations marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day, saying he has a lot business to do in Russia.Speaking in St Petersburg on Thursday as world leaders gathered in Normandy to mark the occasion, Mr Putin said: We do not invite everyone to every event, so why should I be necessarily invited somewhere?Am I a person to be present at every event? I have a lot business to do here in Russia.But if we are imagining conspiracy theories, maybe western leaders wanted to have their own chit chat before having some contact with us.That doesn\u0027t really matter. What matters is the truth about the history and about this horrible tragedy that happened to humanity during the Second World War.This is something we should always remember.Just five years ago Mr Putin attended the 70th D-Day anniversary commemorations but was notably absent from the events in Portsmouth on Wednesday and Normandy on Thursday.Speaking to the heads of international news agencies on the margins of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, the Russian president said tributes must be paid to the heroes of the resistance in Germany and Europe, and to the young men who died on D-Day.Of those who crossed the English Channel on June 6 to storm the five French beaches, he added that they were the real, true heroes, and this is something we should remember.Russia was not involved in the D-Day campaign but was crucial in defeating the Nazis.Touching on this, Mr Putin drew attention to how the Allied invasion was the second front, and emphasised that the first front was formed by the Russians.Valdimir Putin has been speaking about D-Day in St Petersburg todayWith the help of a veteran,  Leon Gautier, one of three surviving French commandos from the Sword Beach push.Macron and Gautier arm in armMacron presents a young commando with his green beretThe Commando and Gautier shake hands and have a short conversationJune 6, D-Day. A day when history shifted. One of those dates when the destiny of France, Europe and the world was at stake. No need to tell you the year. 6th June was the sunset of Nazism.Today, before us, there is an open horizon, clear peace. 75 years ago at the crack of dawn there were squadrons, the greatest fleet ever seem. The sands of the pearl beaches are luminous today but 75 years ago they were red with the blood of men.Today, coming together in brotherhood, we pay homage.Against all odds they made progress. After hours and hours of endless combat silence followed. On the beaches of Sword, Juno, Omaha everyone was brothers in arms. In the following days, everything had to be defended and it all relied on a thread of courage.France knows all that it owes to the soldiers of the landings. On June 6th 3,000 lost their lives. To those heroes thanks to whom we live freely, we realise their glory.When the battle of Normandy was over, 21 commanders had given their lives.All knew the risk of their mission. All accepted to carry it out.Today, on this beach which is at the heart of the epic story, France bows for the lost veterans of D-Day.Let us continue to embrace the freedom of spirit and courage. Long live the republic and long live France.French President Emmanuel Macron inspects troops in NormandyThe French leader is at a service by Sword Beach, in Colleville-Montgomery.Watch it live here.The \u0027s Henry Samuel, in Colleville-sur-Merhas been analysing Emmanuel Macron\u0027s speech, and the message he sent to US president Donald Trump. He writes:Emmanuel Macron has urged Donald Trump to stand up for “true American values by backing multilateral institutions, including the EU, which he said symbolised the spirit of D-Day.”We must never stop working for the alliance of the free world, said Mr Macron. “That is what the US did by creating the UN then Nato. That is what the leaders of this continent did by creating the EU.”This was, he said “the lesson of Colleville-sur-Mer”.In an apparent swipe at Mr Trump’s unilateralist “America first” policies, Mr Macron said: “American is never as great as when it fights for the freedom of others, when it remains faithful to the universal values of its founding fathers.”D-Day was won because forces from Britain, Canada, the United States as well as the French resistance came together in the name of freedom, he added.We must prove ourselves worthy of this heritage of peace that we have been bequeathed, said Mr Macron.He said being worthy of this promise of Normandy meant never forgetting that free peoples can overcome all the challenges when they unite”.This was at the “heart of the true United States,” he said.Despite the apparent French barbs, the body language between the two leaders at Colleville was warm.Taking the podium, Mr Trump hailed the “unbreakable bond” between the US and France as he paid tribute to the D-Day veterans present.You are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live, he told the huge crowd who frequently gave the veterans a standing ovation.You are the pride of our nation, you are the glory of our republic and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.”“Today American embraces the French people and thanks you for honouring our beloved dead.”Mr Trump conceded his relationship with Mr Macron has always been smooth but said: “It’s been good sometimes and sometimes it hasn’t been, but right now it’s outstanding. So the relationship that we’ve had together has been really terrific and I appreciate it very much.”US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron shake hands this afternoon The Royal Air Force Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) complete three flypasts, greeted each time to applause from the crowd below.Steve Bird, who is there, writes: The Conservative MP Tobias Elwood and General the Lord Richard Dannatt, former head of the Army, were among the VIP guests at the commemoration service in Arromanches. An RAF DC-3 Dakota and Spitfire made three raucous fly pasts to rapturous applause from the audience.The service ended with The Orange Liberation Band parading through the street. The veteran carrying regimental colours, including those of the Gloucestershire Regiment, Royal Signal Association and the Normandy Veterans Association, marched through the street to yet more applause.A pipe and drum band played Scotland the Brave leading another procession of veterans through the streets ended the afternoon’s events. In around 15 minutes, we are expecting a parachute display by UK Red Devils and US Golden Knights.Planes fly over the service in ArromanchesOur Senior Reporter Steve Bird is in Arromanches and has met a 94-year-old veteran with a fascinating story.William Blount is one of the few D-Day veterans who can say he never ever set foot on the beaches of Normandy 75 years ago.However, the 94-year-old Royal Marine played a pivotal role in decimating the German war machine targeting British, Canadian and America troops storming the beaches.For exactly 100 days, the gunner loaded hundreds of shells into the 4.7 calibre gun aboard a Landing Craft Gun (LCG) vessel anchored just off Juno beach.“I never set foot ashore. Everyday I was putting shells into that gun, then the cordite before firing ashore,” the former gunner said sat in his wheelchair in Arromanches this afternoon.He struggled to hear the heartfelt thanks from the many people queuing up in the Normandy town to ask for his autograph or wanting to shake him by the hand.“I’ve suffered from tinnitus ever since because of the sound of that gun firing. It made a lot of noise,” he added.“But, it was worth it. We fired nearly every day at Caen. Eventually a Forward Observation Officer ashore told us, ‘You just hit the Germa headquarters. Well done. Keep it up.’ So we did.”For years, Mr Blount kept his experiences aboard that vessel largely to himself. But, after his wife, Hazel, died 13 years ago aged 83, he began to open up about the reality of war to his son Keith, 64, and daughter, Jan, 67.“I watched two torpedoes go by our 180ft LCG,” he said, posing for another photograph with a well wisher in the Normandy town. “There was nothing we could do. It was horrendous. We just had to watch and wait as it passed by.”Mr Blount, from near Woking in Surrey, has returned now more than 13 times to the beaches he had only first seen through binoculars.His daughter, Jan Sturge, said: “Coming here is therapy for him. He never really used to open about it. But, that changed after mum died. He comes here to remember and show respect for the fallen.”Mr Blount, who plans to live to 100 and return again to Arromanches, added: “It’s great being here. The French are very good towards us veterans. I’ve got to know quite a few of them here. They always say it’s nice to see me here.”He recalled how when they eventually sailed the LCG back to Portsmouth it needed its gun replacing because it had become worn out during the onslaught.“We had fired that gun so much at Caen that when we returned to Portsmouth they asked, ‘What the hell have you been doing with it?’ We told them we did a good job with it at targeting the Germans.”William Blount, centre, flanked by Gary and Jan Sturge\u0027God Save the Queen\u0027 rings out, followed by a rousing operatic \u0027La Marseillaise\u0027 and a round of applause.There is now a blessing and a rendition of \u0027The White Cliffs of Dover\u0027.Veterans and their families in ArromanchesThe hymn written by William Whiting in 1860 tells of the dangers of the sea, and is often associated with the Navy, and is evoking strong emotions among those gathered in Arromanches. \u0027Eternal Father, strong to save, Whose arm does bind the restless wave, Who bids the mighty ocean deep Its own appointed limits keep O hear us when we cry to Thee  For those in peril on the sea.\u0027O Savior, whose almighty word, The winds and waves submissive heard, Who walked upon the foaming deep, And calm amid the rage did sleep O hear us when we cry to Thee  For those in peril on the sea.\u0027O Holy Spirit, who did brood Upon the waters dark and rude, And bid their angry tumult cease, And give for wild confusion peace O hear us when we cry to Thee  For those in peril on the sea.\u0027O Trinity of love and pow\u0027r, Your children shield in danger\u0027s hour From rock and tempest, fire, and foe, Protect them where-so-e\u0027er they go Thus, evermore shall rise to Thee Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.\u0027Veterans singing \u0026#39Eternal Father Strong to Save\u0026#39We have a live stream here...A minute\u0027s silence has taken place, and a bugler has played the last post. Now veterans are laying wreaths at the Arromanches service.Among the veterans in Arromanches is 93-year-old Harry Billinge, from St Austell in Cornwall.He is on a final pilgrimage to Normandy to see how thousands of pounds he raised is helping the construction of a national memorial honouring his fallen comrades.He handed over more than £10,000 to the Normandy Memorial Trust after relentlessly collecting donations in his local high street and Arromanches.As an 18-year-old Royal Engineer, he landed on Gold Beach at 6.30am on June 6 1944 as part of the first wave of troops.Mr Billinge said this was his swansong and he did not think he would return again, but he was eager to see the first foundation stones of the monument laid on Thursday morning before the service in Arromanches.Veterans lay wreaths at a sunny ArromanchesThe Prince of Wales has chatted to D-Day veterans in France, including one who met his own grandfather, George VI.Alfred Hicks, an RAF sergeant during the Second World War, met Charles after the memorial ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day at the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery on Thursday.Mr Hicks was working with the Armed Forces Filming Unit when he was sent to document the Normandy invasion on June 6 1944.In the lead-up to the landings, the 94-year-old filmed the king inspecting preparations in Portsmouth.He said: The prince said I got a chance he never got, I got to meet his grandfather, and described the king as a lovely man, a really nice man.Mr Hicks, who landed at Sword Beach on the first day of the campaign, said: I wanted to get off at the beach and film the others coming in, but they then took us to the front line, and then we had to walk all the way back, it took us 12 hours.Charles also met 93-year-old Gerard Robertson, who had an unusual experience when he arrived on Juno Beach aged 18.He trained with the Durham Light Infantry, but got separated from his colleagues after they landed on the beach on D-Day.Mr Robertson said: We got off the boat and I couldn\u0027t find the company, and I never did find them. We ended up going up the beach with the Canadians.The following morning, after we found a ditch to stay in overnight, we found another company, the Engineers.Mr Robertson ended up sticking with the Engineers for the rest of his military career, and joked: The only reason I ended up with the Engineers was because I could fix a bicycle chain!British veterans will descend into the square in Arromanches for a series of informal events hosted by the local authority where there will be music from the Central Band of the Royal Air Force.The Band of the RAF Regiment and the Pipes and Drums of 19 Regiment Royal Artillery will provide support during the celebration events involving a Red Arrows flypast and Red Devils parachute display.Events in Arromanches will conclude with a firework display at 11.30pm.Here is the rundown of what to expect (all local times): 3.15pm - Veterans take their seats3.20pm - Parade Steps Off into the square3.45pm -  Speech from a VIP veteran4pm - Arromanches Mayor speech followed by exhortation by a Normandy veteran and a minute\u0027s silence4.50pm - Band of the Royal Air Force concert5pm - The Royal Air Force Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) complete three flypasts5.20pm - Parachute display by UK Red Devils and US Golden Knights5.35pm - Finale by RAF Regiment Band to include Vera Lynn – We’ll Meet Again, The White Cliffs of Dover and Auld Lang Syne8pm - Concert in civic squareCrowds of visitors have gathered in the square at Arromanches overlooking the beach for a service of remembrance.During the commemoration, wreaths will be laid by British veterans.The veterans were applauded by the crowd as they arrived.An MP has called for a giant new forest to be expanded across the United Kingdom as a tribute to people who fought and died for the freedom of this country.As the world marks the 75th anniversary of the D Day landings, Labour\u0027s Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) said MPs should think profoundly about the young men and women who fought and lost their lives in the Second World War.He said a planned new forest in the North of England should be extended across the entire country.Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Sheerman said: As a fitting tribute, can we actually seriously look at something that I am passionate about, and that is the growth of trees to remember people, to remember their contribution?There is going to be a new Northern Forest stretching all the way from Hull to Liverpool, 50 million trees.Could we expand that across the United Kingdom as a real tribute to those people who fought for us in the war, many of whom died fighting for the freedom of this country?Commons Leader Mel Stride replied: We should seek whatever means we can to pay tribute to those who fought on our behalf in the Second World War.You have referenced the planting of trees and I remember, as a young boy actually, Plant A Tree In \u002773, I think is what we were urged to do way back then.I assume there are forests of these giant trees here today as a consequence of that particular initiative.You referred to the great Northern Forest, which I think is an excellent and an imaginative approach.Mr Stride advised Mr Sheerman to bring the matter up at environment questions, which he said would be an excellent opportunity to bring up the idea with ministers.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have posted their own tribute to the D-Day veterans. On their official Instagram account, they took an excerpt from Prince Harry\u0027s speech to the Chelsea pensioners earlier today. It said: Don’t ever underestimate the joy that you bring to everyone you meet. You represent something really quite special, you are special, and society will always recognise that.That is an important part of your legacy....It’s a community that focuses on supporting each other with kindness, respect and compassion, as well as reaching out to serve the wider community....On this 75th Anniversary of D-Day, I can comfortably speak for everyone when I say we are honoured to be in the presence of six Normandy Landing veterans.Phoebe Southworth is in Arromanches for The . This afternoon it will host a commemorative ceremony overlooking Gold Beach. It will feature music from the Central Band of the Royal Air Forces. There has been activity in the Normandy commune all day, and as the tide came in, so did an amphibious US military vehicle called The Flying Duckman, which parked up in the harbour with its  Stars and Stripes flag swaying in the the breeze.The Somme Battlefield Pipe Band also filed through the centre of Arromanches wearing kilts playing traditional Scottish and Irish airs.Formed in 1989, the band aims to promote the music and history of the Scottish soldiers and their Regiments during their time in Northern France and the Somme Area in 19141918 and during the second World War.D-Day veteran Len Cox, of the 56th Brigade, 2nd Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment, is one of the poster boys of the D-Day anniversary and his war-time portrait appears on WWII heroes posters around Arromanches.Visitors walk in a street of Arromanches in NormandyA fanatical singer and dancer, he gave an impromptu performance of some of his favourite songs to crowds vying for their pictures of him to be signed with his autograph following a military ceremony.He told The : In the early days I used to jitterbug. Have you ever heard of the move \u0027necking the chicken\u0027? It\u0027s when the girl straddles the man with both legs and you bob your heads on either side of each other.Nowadays I couldn\u0027t get down on my knees like I used to or I\u0027d probably never get up!He added: Today is important because it\u0027s the 75th anniversary, which is very special. If it hasn\u0027t been for those men then we wouldn\u0027t be standing here today.This is Harry Billinge. He won\u0027t accept it, but he is a D-Day war hero. He told BBC Breakfast his story. Disclaimer: It might make you cry. Second World War veteran Jimmy Ockendon wept as he remembered those who lost their lives on D-Day during an emotional memorial service in Portsmouth.The 97-year-old wiped away tears during the commemoration at the Southsea D-Day Stone, which was attended by thousands of members of the public who paid their respects during a minute\u0027s silence.Royal British Legion standard bearers along with the Band of Her Majesty\u0027s Royal Marines and a platoon of Royal Marines Cadets escorted veterans as they marched along the seafront to reach the memorial stone.The service was conducted by Canon Bob White and featured the Portsmouth Cathedral Choir.Mr Ockendon said: It was very emotional, the main person I was thinking of was my uncle who went on the Hood, his wife had died just beforehand and he left two young children and my father and mother adopted them.I was also thinking of my father.As well as wearing his own service medals, Mr Ockendon, from Portsmouth, donned those of his father, Sergeant James Ockendon, who was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre and the Victoria Cross for his role in the First World War.Mr Ockendon, who was serving at the time of D-Day but not directly involved in the operation, said: We were just off France and I heard on the Tannoy what was happening.We didn\u0027t worry much in those days, we just got on with the job.Jimmy Ockendon lays a wreath at the D-Day stone in SouthseaMr Ockendon, who attended with his wife Joyce, 84, attended the service after earlier this week naming a train The D-Day Story Portsmouth for South Western Railway in recognition of the 75th anniversary.The service was also attended by Portsmouth South Labour MP Stephen Morgan, whose grandfather James Kaminski landed on Juno Beach as part of the Normandy operation at the age of 17 while serving in the Royal Army Service Corps.Mr Morgan said: He lied about his age and joined the Army four months early and his first major operation was landing on the beach.One of my biggest regrets is not asking him enough about his story but he was quite reluctant because it was such a traumatic experience.He added: Yesterday we saw Portsmouth can do these events brilliantly at an international level, with Her Majesty the Queen and 15 heads of state in our city, and today, yet again, we have demonstrated we can do these events locally.This shows to me Portsmouth is a place for reflection, recollection and remembrance.The Duke of Cambridge this morning paid tribute to the fallen at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, spending time with veterans after pledging to remember all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, writes our Royal Correspondent Hannah Furness. As the Duke bent down on one knee to better hear elderly servicemen, Royal Navy veteran Victor Brunt, 94, joked: I thought it was us who had to go on bended knee to you. Duke of Cambridge talks to veteransPrince William told him: Not you guys. It’s not a problem. John Jack Cannane, 95, of the Royal Electrical Engineers, told the Prince that he was under constant fire as he and his team tried to clear the stranded vehicles and landing craft so that the each wave could land.It was carnage. But I was a young man, only 20 and at that age you don’t really have any fear. Except of course the shock of seeing the bodies of young men on the beaches or floating in the water.But you just keep thinking to yourself that it isn’t going to be you. That’s the only way you survive I think, he said.Earlier this morning, a solemn Duke paid tribute to the D-Day fallen by reading aloud the words of his great grandfather King George VI.  His reading said: Four years ago our nation and empire stood alone against an overwhelming enemy, with our backs to the wall. Now once more a supreme test has to be faced. This time the challenge is not to fight to survive but to fight to win the final victory for the good cause. At this historic moment surely not one of us is too busy, too young, or too old to play a part in a nation-wide, perchance a world-wide vigil of prayer as the great crusade sets forth.Prince William lays a wreath in the pouring rainThe Duke, a former serving Army captain and RAF helicopter pilot, joined more than 20 D-Day veterans, and members of the public, at the service in Heroes’ Square then laid a wreath at the Normandy Campaign Memorial. The service of Remembrance has been organised as part of The Royal British Legion’s commemorative programme for D-Day 75, and will be led by the Honorary Arboretum Chaplains.Laying a wreath of poppies in the pouring rain, he left a message reading: In memory of all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We will remember them. William.Prince Harry, who is spending the morning with six D-Day veterans at the Royal Chelsea Hospital has delivered a speech in which he pays tributes both to their service and their everlasting sense of fun, Royal Correspondent Hannah Furness writes.Sharing his amusement at their late night cricket in the hallways and synchronised buggy drills, he said: I stand here before you to not only acknowledge the incredible contribution you have made to this nation but to acknowledge that you, my friends, are also seriously good fun to be around!You will always stand out in your scarlet coats and white gloves, but to me, whether I see you at Westminster Abbey, the Chelsea Flower Show, Twickenham Stadium, or the pub, I notice that you are always smiling.Don’t ever underestimate the joy that you bring to everyone you meet. You represent something really quite special, you are special, and society will always recognise that. That is an important part of your legacy.Here, I see a community that continues to value the importance of teamwork which military service in particular can teach you.It’s a community that focuses on supporting each other with kindness, respect and compassion, as well as reaching out to serve the wider community.The Duke of Sussex salutes the Chelsea pensionersMarking the significance of today\u0027s anniversary, he said: On this 75th Anniversary of D-Day, I can comfortably speak for everyone when I say we are honoured to be in the presence of six Normandy Landing veterans.To all who are on parade today, I can only say that you are a constant reminder of the great debt we owe those who have served this nation.You embody the fitting home that awaits them in the peace and tranquillity of the Royal Hospital, should they want it.But more widely, wherever you are, your presence is a symbol of the sacrifices that have been made by all veterans to sustain the freedoms and democracy we value so deeply today.Ladies and Gentleman, could I ask that those who are able to, please stand in recognition of our veterans. We stand together and remember those who have sacrificed their lives for our freedom.And for you here today, who have served us so greatly and with such honour, I congratulate you on the smartness of your turnout and the steadiness of your bearing. I thank you for inviting me here today and I wish you all the health and happiness you so richly deserve.A number of events are continuing in Britain away from the poignancy of northern France. Veterans are still milling around at Bayeux cemetery, paying their respects to those fellow comrades who were killed in battle. In London, the six inch guns aboard HMS Belfast were fired on the Thames to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. The six inch guns on board HMS Belfast in London are fired to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landingsThe Prince of Wales and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall are walking around the cemetery in Bayeux, observing the graves of those who lost their lives during the Second World War. Prince Charles and Camilla walk amongst the gravesGod Save The Queen is blasted out at the cemetery as D-Day veterans salute the memorial of their fallen comrades. This is followed by La Marseillaise. War heroes, immortalised with their gallantry medals glinting in the sunshine, then watch as the procession leaves.Theresa May is among those to lay a wreath in honour of those who lost their lives in Normandy. The Lord Is My Shepherd is then played out as the Normandy veterans are invited forward to lay wreaths for their fallen comrades. Normandy veterans lay their wreathsUnder blue skies, distinguished guests and veterans alike stood as the last post was played. They then observed a two-minute silence. Some D-Day heroes could be seen welling up as they looked out at the sea of graves that belong to their comrades. The Last Post was played by the Band and Bugles of The Rifles, followed by a two minutes silence.D-Day veteran Alan Harris then read: When you go home, tell of us and say, for your tomorrow, we gave our today.The Prime Minister is on stage giving a reading. Wearing a commemorative poppy on her blazer, she addresses the crowd with a section of the Book of Micah.As she does so, war aircraft pass overhead. Joe Shute, who is at the ceremony for The , believes the flypast was mistimed: Theresa May\u0027s address to the service was interrupted by what appeared to be a mistimed flypast overhead.Before the Prime Minister reached the and of Micah 4:1-5 a spitfire and bomber in D Day black and white livery roared overhead momentarily drowning out the Prime Minister delivering perhaps the final speech of her official term. This is followed by the singing of the hymn Abide With Me before D-Day veteran Ray Lord then read: They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old.Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.At the going down of the sun, and in the morning, we will remember them.War hero Frank Baugh, who trained at HMS Collingwood in Portsmouth, is delivering his speech at the cemetery in Bayeux. Our Senior Features Writer Joe Shute is watching the ceremony. Read his account below. During the ceremony at Bayeux Royal Navy signalman Frank Baugh addressed the crowd with his own painful memories of D Day.The 95-year-old was tasked with transporting 200 troops from 2nd Batallion King\u0027s Shropshire Light Infantry from Newhaven to Sword Beach.On the way they received a direct hit meaning the men had to bail out into four feet of water.We were talking moments before but they were cut down by machine guns, he said.They fell into the water floating face down and we couldn\u0027t get them out. That is my abiding memory and I cant forget it.The Prince of Wales is among the guests at the cemetery in Bayeux where there are almost 400 unidentified graves. The Duchess of Cornwall and Prime Minister are also attending the cemetery service.The Royal Yeomanry and its band are providing a Guard of Honour and Royal Salute at the Bayeux Cemetery Service, with the Band of The Rifles in support.The road alongside the cemetery is Boulevard Fabian Ware, named after the founder of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Bayeux War Cemetery is the largest Commonwealth war cemetery of the Second World War in France.Both the cemetery and the memorial were designed by Philip Hepworth.The Latin inscription on the memorial recalls the Norman invasion of Britain in 1066 and reads: We, once conquered by William, have now set free the Conqueror’s native land.Our Royal Correspondent Hannah Furness has been keeping an eye on the royals at the D-Day events. Here are the thoughts of the Prince of Wales.In an interview with the BBC, the Prince of Wales has spoken of the deep significance of the 75th anniversary D-Day commemorations, saying it is probably the last chance to pay everlasting respect to these remarkable people who wanted above all to do their duty. I always think of people all around this country whose relations took part in D-Day and will be thinking so much about their grandfathers, fathers or great-grandfathers, he said. I\u0027ve been lucky enough to know so many of these veterans over my lifetime.  After the 70th anniversary, the Prince commissioned a series of 12 portraits of veterans to capture their spirit for centuries to come. I\u0027ve always felt that it\u0027s absolutely key to try and have a record of people who have given so much to this country in one way or another, he said. We looked at some of my old regiments, of which I\u0027m colonel-in-chief and very proud to be, and those veterans were sitting for different artists.They are very evocative. There were some wonderful figures in that who were chosen. I met them all and I\u0027m thrilled that we have something that will mean their memory is immortalised along with so many others who died with them.Of the importance of the Normandy services, the Prince said: I remember the last time we were there, I will never forget the determination that they still exude by being there. Being at the cemeteries and being at the commemorations. They always remember their comrades and their friends and the people they had to leave behind.This country lost countless special people and we owe it to them and their families to go on commemorating this.Asked whether this 75th anniversary would be particularly poignant, he added: It\u0027s probably the last chance to pay everlasting respect to these remarkable people who wanted above all to do their duty.The US president paid tribute to the greatest Americans that have ever lived and the pride of the nation. Midway through his speech, he turned around and applauded the veterans sat behind him at Omaha Beach. The US veterans, in turn applauded their president. Mr Trump delivered a long address, recalling D-Day through the viewpoint of a number of veterans present.  The \u0027s France Correspondent Henry Samuel is at Omaha beach. Here is his take from the sandy beaches. Under brilliant blue skies, thousands have gathered for this morning’s tribute to the fallen at Omaha beach. The sun and calm seas could not be more different than the atrocious conditions that faced Allied troops that day.It’s pristine now. It was so bad and pitiful that day. Now it’s so beautiful, said American D-Day veteran Jack Ewald, 94, from Suffolk Virginia, in full of the beach he scaled under German machine gun fire 75 years ago.Mr Ewald came back in 2010 and he said he wouldn’t have missed the 75th for the world. “It’s given me more energy than I’ve had in a decade,” he said.Some 4,400 Allied troops on the first day of the landings, more than half at Omaha beach. Mr Ewald was in company K, 115th infantry, 29th ision.I’m no hero, just a plain old guy like most of us, he said beside his granddaughter Megan Forbes, 34.We didn’t do anything special. We all protected each other. We knew we had to do it and we did it. There weren’t no hero business about it.Our Senior Features Writer Joe Shute is in Bayeux, where hundreds of people have lined the streets to clap and cheer D-Day veterans as they parade from the cathedral service to the Commonwealth War  Graves cemetery ahead of a memorial there later today. Veterans are waiting in Bayeux cemetery for the annual commemorative service to begin.Veterans at Bayeux cemetery Afterwards the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall as well as Prime Minister Theresa May will mingle with the war heroes.The Duke of Sussex has arrived at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London to review the Chelsea pensioners at the annual Founder\u0027s Day Parade.The parade commemorates King Charles II\u0027s founding of the institution in 1681.Founder\u0027s Day is also known as Oak Apple Day referring to the oak tree that Charles hid in to avoid being captured by Parliamentary forces after the Battle of Worcester in 1651.Harry, a former Army officer, arrived wearing his Blues and Royals frock coat and like all the pensioners and guests wore a sprig of oak leaves in honour of Charles.At a commemoration service at the National Memorial Arboretum, the Duke of Cambridge delivered the D-Day address made by his great-grandfather King George VI in 1944.He said: Four years ago our nation and empire stood alone against an overwhelming enemy, with our backs to the wall.Now once more a supreme test has to be faced.This time the challenge is not to fight to survive but to fight to win the final victory for the good cause.At this historic moment surely not one of us is too busy, too young, or too old to play a part in a nationwide, perchance a world-wide vigil of prayer as the great crusade sets forth.In a lovely moment during yesterday\u0027s coverage, Simon McCoy was interviewing Eric Chardin in Portsmouth. He was just 19 when he landed in Normandy 75 years ago. In a poignant interview, he refused to call himself a hero or even brave, saying: you have to admit, one was scared. Wrapping up the interview, McCoy asks Mr Chardin if anybody has recently said thank you to him for his service. When the war hero says no, the BBC presenter responds: Well can I, on behalf of everybody watching, just say thank you.Mr Chardin appears taken aback, and replies: Well, thank you. Thank you for your courtesy.McCoy then thanks him again for the interview before beginning to turn to the camera when Mr Chardin interrupts, saying: Have you finished?He continues: What will you do with it?

They were essentially the car of the army.He added: It is important to remember the sacrifices that everyone who fought here made.In the same way we remember those who died fighting for their country in the First World War, we must also remember those who died in the Second World War.Jeeps driven on the beachWe are aware that there are so few veterans left, just a handful now, and they love seeing our vehicles.They say things like \u0027oh yes, I drove one of those from Normandy to Berlin\u0027.Seven local police officers from the gendarmerie in Arromanches directed the Jeeps, tanks and amphibious military vehicles as they snaked their way around the shore, the drivers showcasing them to crowds of onlookers.Many took the opportunity to snap selfies behind the wheel of unmanned vehicles parked up on the beach.A harmonica player with a whistle around his neck, flanked by two guitarists and a man with a tambourine, set up camp at the entrance to the harbour.Crowds of music-lovers quickly formed a semi-circle around the band, called Herbie Blues, and clapped along to their country-style American songs.Theresa May has paid tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice at an inauguration ceremony of a new British Normandy Memorial in France, 75 years on from D-Day.She joined French President Emmanuel Macron at the event in Ver-sur-Mer, Normandy, on one of her final official engagements as Conservative leader.They laid wreaths at the foundation stone for the new memorial, which will list the names of all 22,442 members of the British armed forces who died in the Normandy campaign in summer 1944 and overlooks Gold Beach, where many of the troops arrived on D-Day.Speaking at the service, Mrs May said: It\u0027s incredibly moving to be here today, looking out over the beaches where one of the greatest battles for freedom this world has ever known took place.And it is truly humbling to do so with the men who were there that day.Theresa May standing in front of the sculptureShe continued: Standing here as the waves wash quietly on to the shore below us, it is almost impossible to grasp the raw courage it must have taken that day to leap from the landing craft and into the surf despite the fury of battle.If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world, that day was June 6 1944.The Prime Minister also paid tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice, saying: They laid down their lives so that we might have a better life and build a better world.The sculpture was created by David Williams-Ellis to mark the beginning of construction for the memorial, funded by the Normandy Memorial Trust, which is expected to be completed within a year.David Woodrow, 95, from Norwich ahead of the Inauguration of the British Normandy Memorial site in Ver-sur-MerMr Clements was a petty officer in the Royal Navy on board the 900-tonne frigate HMS Mountsea, protecting the convoys approaching the landing beaches on D-Day from Nazi attacks.He helped drop depth charges at U-boats with little success, including targeting one which had earlier sunk an Allied troop ship and was then destroyed by a Canadian vessel.Mr Clements, from Whitstable, said he was not scared at the time, despite heavy shelling.Now 98, he said it is fantastic that the memorial is being built.He said: It should have been done long ago but it\u0027s never too late.As World in Union - the anthem for the Rugby World Cup, which takes place in Japan later this year - plays the guests out, The Prince of Wales and Theresa May leave Bayeux Cathedral. Here is Mrs May greeting Prince Charles - perhaps for the last time - outside the building.Flags of the nations that took part in the struggles are hanging inside Bayeux Cathedral.

Here is his report.In Courseulles-sur-Mer, hundreds of people attended a special ceremony to mark 75 years since Canadian troops became the first wave of allied forces to land on Juno beach 75 years ago. Houses and shops lining the streets leading to the seafront were adorned with British, Canadian, American and French flags. American World War II-style jeeps and motorbikes were driven into the ceremony to applause from some passers by.Bus loads of schoolchildren were also arriving to attend the event. The Prince of Wales and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall have arrived at Bayeux Cathedral for a service, which is due to start shortly. The Prince of Wales is wearing a number of military medals at the D-Day commemorative service.They include: the Queen\u0027s Service Order, New Zealand, the Canadian Forces decoration, the New Zealand commemorative medal, the long service good conduct medal, and medals marking the Queen\u0027s coronation and jubilees.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also arrived. Our Defence Correspondent Dominic Nicholls watched the ceremony at Ver-sur-Mer. Here is his take on the commemorations. Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron take a moment to look out to sea in NormandyAs a calm tide lapped against what was Gold Beach on D-Day, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron spoke at the inauguration of the Normandy Memorial. Theresa May said: “If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come, in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world, that day was the sixth of June 1944”. She paid tribute to “the greatest generation”, saying its “unconquerable spirit shaped our post-war world. “They didn’t boast, they didn’t fuss, they served. They did their duty. And they laid down their lives so that we may have a better life and build a better world”. Speaking in English, President Macron said “We owe our freedom to this. And whatever it takes we will never surrender. And whatever it takes we will always stand together. Because this is our common destiny”. With a nod to Brexit, he continued in French: Nothing can ever break ties that have been bound in bloodshed and shared values. The debates taking place today cannot affect the strength of our joint history and shared future.In a personal message to Theresa May, he said: Leaders May come and go, but their achievements remain. The force of our friendship will outlast current events. I believe that we can be proud of our actions at the bilateral level, and the causes we have defended at the international level.The Normandy Memorial cost £20million and was funded from LIBOR dunes levied against the banking sector. Here is the text of the speech delivered by Prime Minister Theresa May alongside French President Emmanuel Macron at the inauguration of the British Normandy Memorial.She said: Thank you President Macron for your support to ensure a lasting monument to the service and sacrifice of those who fought in the Battle of Normandy - something which means so much to our veteran community and to the whole of the British nation.It is incredibly moving to be here today, looking out across beaches where one of the greatest battles for freedom this world has ever known took place - and it is truly humbling to do so with the men who were there that day.It is an honour for all of us to share this moment with you.Standing here, as the waves wash quietly onto the shore, it\u0027s almost impossible to grasp the raw courage that it must have taken that day to leap out from landing craft and into the surf - despite the fury of battle.No one could be certain what June 6 would bring. No one would know how this - the most ambitious - amphibious and airborne assault in all of human history, would turn out.And, as the sun rose that morning, not one of the troops on the landing craft approaching these shores, not one of the pilots in the skies above, not one of the sailors at sea - knew whether they would still be alive when it set once again.If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come - in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world - that day was June 6, 1944.More than 156,000 men landed on D-Day - of which 83,000 were from Britain and the Commonwealth.Over a quarter million more supported operations from air and sea - while the French Resistance carried out extraordinary acts of bravery behind enemy lines. Many were terribly wounded.And many more made the ultimate sacrifice that day and in the fierce fighting that followed, as together our allied nations sought to release Europe from the grip of fascism.Theresa May delivering her speechMen like Lieutenant Den Brotheridge of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. Twenty-eight years old. Husband. Father-to-be. Thought to be the first Allied soldier to be killed in action after leading the charge over Pegasus Bridge.Marine Commando Robert Casson of 46 Royal Marine Commando, who was killed on the approach to Juno Beach, three weeks before his brother Private Joseph Casson was also killed in Normandy.And twins Robert and Charles Guy, 21, who both served in the RAF and were shot down and buried separately. Their names will now be reunited here.These young men belonged to a very special generation, the greatest generation.A generation whose unconquerable spirit shaped the post-war world. They didn\u0027t boast. They didn\u0027t fuss. They served.And they laid down their lives so that we might have a better life and build a better world.The memorial that will be built here will remind us of this. Of the service and sacrifice of those who fell under British Command in Normandy, of the price paid by French civilians - and of our duty, and our responsibility, to now carry the torch for freedom, for peace and for democracy.Theresa May closing her speechI want to thank all those involved in this memorial. George Batts and the veterans who have campaigned so hard to make it happen. The people of Ver-sur-Mer, and Phillipe Onillon the town\u0027s mayor.Here in Normandy, the names of those British men and women who gave their lives in defence of freedom, will forever sit opposite their homeland across the Channel.Here in Normandy, we will always remember their courage, their commitment, their conviction.And to our veterans, here in Normandy, I want to say the only words we can: thank you.Scotland\u0027s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is attending commemorative  events in Bayeux, tweeted: Beautiful morning in Bayeux as we prepare to  remember those who landed on the beaches 75 years ago today to liberate France  and Europe from Nazi occupation. There was a touching moment as Emmanuel Macron handed over to Theresa May between their speeches at Ver-sur-Mer. Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron In his speech, the French President said: Leaders may come and go but their achievements remain. The force of our friendship will outlast current events.Talking to Mrs May, he says: It has been a pleasure to work alongside you, before the pair embraced.They didn\u0027t quite burst into a hug - but it was as close as it could be. Veterans and their families are arriving for a service of remembrance at Bayeux Cathedral.They will be joined by Prime Minister Theresa May, and the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall for the commemoration marking 75 years since D-Day.Joe Shute is there for The . He says: Villages surrounding Bayeux have adorned flagpoles with images of fallen soldiers of the Normandy landings.The flags of all the Allied countries who led the invasion are fluttering while Flanders poppies - that potent symbol of remembrance - are in bloom along the roadside verges. As Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron leave Ver-sur-Mer, the next big event is at Bayeux Cathedral. Joe Shute reports from France. Today the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will join veterans at the Royal British Legion service of remembrance at Bayeux Cathedral and neighbouring cemetery.They will be attended by Prime Minister Theresa May and the French President Emmanual Macron alongside150 veterans of the Normandy campaign.On June 7, 1945, Bayeux was the first French city to be liberated following the D Day invasion and the cemetery contains the graves of 4,144 Allied soldiers making it the largest in the region.The city was liberated by the 50th Northumbrian Division who had landed on Gold Beach. The men of the 50th Northumbrian are remembered on a plaque opposite the city cathedral.John Cornwall, 92, was a 17-year-old private with the North Gloucesteshire Regiment on the day and among the troops that helped seize the city.Like many of those to take part in the Normandy Landings he lied about his age in order to sign up.When we arrived people were waving flags cheering and handing us drinks, he recalls. The city was a big army depot for the Germans but they knew we were coming and mostly left it to us apart from a few snipers.Cornwall has numerous comrades buried in Bayeux as well as the surrounding cemeteries. I have come every year for the last 40 years, he says. It is always very emotional.Our news reporter Phoebe Southworth is in Arrmomanches-les-Bains.

Once fully built the British Normandy Memorial will record the names of those under British command who lost their lives in Normandy between the D-Day landings and 31 August 1944. Also honoured will be the tens of thousands of French citizens who lost their lives during the period.The French President is up to talk to the gathered crowd.Addressing the audience, President Macron said: I am honoured to stand alongside Theresa May today to launch construction work for the British memorial at Ver-sur-Mer.The British people have long dreamt of this memorial.He added: This is where, 75 years ago, on June 6, 1944, almost 25,000 British soldiers landed in France to free the country from Nazi control.This is where young men, many of whom had never set foot on French soil, landed at dawn under German fire, risking their lives while fighting their way up the beach, which was littered with obstacles and mines.He added: It is time to remedy the fact that no memorial pays tribute to the United Kingdom\u0027s contribution to the Battle of Normandy.He said the monument would also be a symbol of the ties binding France and the UK.He said: Nothing will break them. Nothing can ever break ties that have been bound in bloodshed and shared values.The debates taking place today cannot affect the strength of our joint history and our shared future.President Macron assured Mrs May of his friendship, adding: Leaders may come and go but their achievements remain.The force of our friendship will outlast current events.Talking to Theresa May, he says: It has been a pleasure to work alongside you, before the pair embrace.Private Liam Dawson is now giving a reading.His father and uncle were both in the Green Howards, a predecessor of the modern-day Yorkshire Regiment.The Green Howards were a key regiment during the D-Day invasion and Stanley Hollis of the Green Howards won the only VC of D-Day a short distance from the memorial site. Liam joined the British Army in 2017 at the age of eighteen.He joined 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment and has recently served overseas in Kabul, Afghanistan.Several D-Day veterans are at Ver-sur-Mer to drink in the commemorations. The ceremony has begun in France in Ver-sur-Mer.On 6 June 1944 the British 50th Infantry Division landed at Ver-sur-Mer as part of Operation Overlord.The commune of Ver-sur-Mer in Calvados is located along Gold Beach and is currently the town chosen to host the main British monument of the Normandy landings.And just like that - here he is. Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May Theresa May is waiting at Ver-sur-Mer for her French counterpart ahead of today\u0027s D-Day commemorations. Today is the 75th anniversary of the landings. The British Prime Minister is ready and waiting in France. The Prime Minister is waiting for Mr Macron at Ver-sur-Mer.To fully understand just how remarkable the achievement of D-Day and the Normandy campaign that followed was, it is worth casting the net back four years to that darkest hour, June 1940.Britain and France had declared war against Germany, confident that they had the resources, wealth, and global reach to stop Hitler and the tide of Nazism.For all Germany’s grandstanding and military drum-beating, Hitler’s Reich lay at the heart of Europe, with little access to the world’s oceans, with neither a decent navy nor merchant navy and therefore lacked the resources needed to conduct a modern war.Britain’s Royal Navy immediately imposed an economic blockade while France mobilised its vast army of millions. Britain and France, admittedly apprehensive, nonetheless expected to prevail.By June 1940, such hopes had been shattered. German shock and awe had delivered its Blitzkrieg, mighty France had crumbled and the forces of totalitarianism and nationalism were sweeping across.Read the full article.The invasion force was not only the greatest assembled in history but D-Day was an exceptional feat of arms, logistics and leadership that relied upon meticulous planning, phenomenal levels of secrecy and disinformation and the closest possible co-operation between Britain and her Allies, especially those from across the Atlantic.This emphasis on collaboration, without which D-Day could not have happened, has been to the fore once again in recent days with the state visit to the UK of Donald Trump. The US president is seen as an iconoclast when it comes to supporting the post-war global order and its multilateral institutions like the UN and Nato.President of the United States, Donald Trump reads from the 32nd U.S. President President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u0026#39s prayer to the US on stage during the D-Day CommemorationsMany European leaders will hope his presence at the D-Day commemorations will have modified his protectionist instincts, though the best way they can achieve that is to pay a greater share of the cost of their own defence.Read the full editorial. Today\u0027s commemorations have kicked off with the tradition of a lone piper playing a lament on the remaining Mulberry Harbour in the Normandy town called Port Winston.Standing atop the structure, Pipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie, of 19th Regiment Royal Artillery (The Scottish Gunners) performed Highland Laddie at 7.25am local time,  signalling the minute the invasion began and the moment the first British soldier landed on Gold beach.Crowds gathered on the beach below him and lined the promenade, applauding his performance.Afterwards his performance on Arromanches beach, Pipe Major Macey-Lillie said:  That was nerve wracking to do but I feel very proud and it was a privilege to  do it.Pipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie of the Scots Royal artillery performs at Mulberry harbour More than 300 veterans will be flocking to the town of Arromanches for a series of events on Wednesday to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day.Just as in the UK, the D-Day anniversary featured on the front pages of many newspapers in France and Germany on Thursday.Le Figaro: The morning of freedomAalener Nachrichten: Merkel and the \u0026#39gift of the story\u0026#39Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt: A beach in JuneD-Day veterans and other people are marking exactly 75 years since the invasion of Normandy that helped change the course of the Second World War.As the sun rose on  Thursday over Omaha Beach, about 100 people gathered at dawn on the edge of the waters that ran red here on June 6, 1944, the first of five code-named beaches where Allied forces came ashore to push the Nazis out of France.World War II reenactors stand looking out to sea on Omaha Beach, in Normandy, France, at dawnAmerican Richard Clapp said it was sobering to admire the beautiful sunrise where Allied troops came ashore.Norwegian Sigrid Flaata drove from Oslo in a 1942 restored jeep to honour the soldiers who died on D-Day.Belgian Filip Van Hecke called his journey a small effort to pay homage.It\u0027s an early start today as a host of ceremonies and events are due to take place to mark D-Day. 06:25:  A lone piper from 19th Regiment Royal Artillery will play on the Mulberry Harbour in Arromanches-les-Bains to mark 75 years to the minute since the first British soldier landed and the start  of the amphibious invasion of Gold Beach.Lone Piper Major Trevor Macey-Lillie 19th Regiment RA (The Scottish Gunners) rehearses at the Mulberry Harbour07:30:  Normandy Memorial inauguration ceremony at Ver-sur-Mer.

However in shorter events, bodies tend to use up their own resources and burn small amounts of fat or muscle mass which can be recovered afterwards.Alongside extreme sporting events, the scientists took notes on the energy expended by pregnant women.They found that the maximum sustainable energy expenditure among endurance athletes was only marginally above the metabolic rates of mothers during pregnancy.When pregnant, a woman\u0027s energy use peaks at over twice their resting metabolic rate compared to marathon runners who use 15.6 times their resting metabolic rate.The study, in Science Advances, suggested that the physiological limits that keep Ironman triathletes from breaking records time and again are the same factors constraining how big babies can grow in the womb.“This defines the realm of what’s possible for humans,” said study co-author Herman Pontzer, an associate professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University.He added that, as far as the researchers know, no one has ever sustained levels beyond this limit.“So I guess it’s a challenge to elite endurance athletes.Science works when you’re proven wrong. Maybe someone will break through that ceiling some day and show us what we’re missing,” he said.D-Day commemorations: Prince Charles says today is \u0026#39probably last chance to pay everlasting respect\u0026#39 to veterans - latest updatesFantasising about killing your boss is normal, leading psychologist says Biodegradable plastic is misleading because most will not break down in compost heaps, UCL scientists sayBoris Johnson best placed Tory candidate to challenge Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn, poll findsBrexit Party has 3,000 applications from wannabe MPs wanting to fight the next general election Matt Hancock vows to \u0026#39save\u0026#39 high street with tax cut for small retailers funded by new Amazon taxComment: The next Tory leader will owe far more to Cameron than Thatcher\u0026#39Most Isil fighters are from Saudi Arabia\u0026#39: Qatari Sheikh hits back over regional blockade in rare interviewEastEnders, the return of Zammo, review: a cheeky, cheery but all-too-brief Grange Hill cameoJeremy Corbyn ally used external email address to intervene over anti-Semitism caseSecond yellow vest protester charged with harassing Anna SoubryKenneth Noye has pulled the wool over parole board\u0026#39s eyes, says policeman who helped bring killer to justiceMadonna claims Harvey Weinstein \u0026#39crossed lines and boundaries\u0026#39 when she worked with himFailed NHS trust faces third inquiry to investigate patient deathsSenior policeman refuses to apologise to journalists accused of stealing confidential documents Comment: The roaring success of Trump\u0026#39s state visit proves the Special Relationship is alive and wellJoe Biden beats Donald Trump in Texas poll as he breaks from Democratic party line on abortionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"macron bids may fond farewell rocky relationship","story":"French president Emmanuel Macron has been a thorn in Theresa May\u0027s side throughout the Brexit negotiations. But on Thursday, as the two leaders paid tribute to those who fought and died on D-Day 1944, he had nothing but warm words for the departing prime minister.At the opening of a memorial overlooking Gold Beach in Normandy, Macron paid tribute to May, expressing his friendship with her and giving her his thanks.Watch the video in the player above to see how Macron\u0027s kind words to May stand in contrast to their disagreements over Brexit.D-Day commemorations: Prince Charles says today is \u0026#39probably last chance to pay everlasting respect\u0026#39 to veterans - latest updatesFantasising about killing your boss is normal, leading psychologist says Biodegradable plastic is misleading because most will not break down in compost heaps, UCL scientists sayMatt Hancock vows to \u0026#39save\u0026#39 high street with tax cut for small retailers funded by new Amazon taxBoris Johnson best placed Tory candidate to challenge Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn, poll findsBrexit Party has 3,000 applications from wannabe MPs wanting to fight the next general election Comment: The next Tory leader will owe far more to Cameron than ThatcherLimit of human endurance discovered by Duke University and pregnancy is very close to maximum\u0026#39Most Isil fighters are from Saudi Arabia\u0026#39: Qatari Sheikh hits back over regional blockade in rare interviewEastEnders, the return of Zammo, review: a cheeky, cheery but all-too-brief Grange Hill cameoJeremy Corbyn ally used external email address to intervene over anti-Semitism caseSecond yellow vest protester charged with harassing Anna SoubryKenneth Noye has pulled the wool over parole board\u0026#39s eyes, says policeman who helped bring killer to justiceMadonna claims Harvey Weinstein \u0026#39crossed lines and boundaries\u0026#39 when she worked with himFailed NHS trust faces third inquiry to investigate patient deathsSenior policeman refuses to apologise to journalists accused of stealing confidential documents Comment: The roaring success of Trump\u0026#39s state visit proves the Special Relationship is alive and wellJoe Biden beats Donald Trump in Texas poll as he breaks from Democratic party line on abortionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 6 june 2019","story":"Sunny Gill posing in a floral headpiece at the Crowning Glory exhibit designed by Ruthie Ford and Emma McGeehan, during the RHS Chatsworth Flower Show, set on the banks of the River Derwent in the Peak District National Park.

Here\u0027s whyClick to followThe IndependentSir Philip Green plans to continue with efforts to restructure his Arcadia Group over the coming daysThe rule in the City is you don’t hold a vote you can’t win.\u0026nbspThe adjournment of today’s crunch Arcadia creditors’ meeting to discuss the Company Voluntary Arrangement proposed by Sir Philip Green needs to be seen in that context.\u0026nbspReports through the day indicated significant resistance from landlords.\u0026nbspGreen told to fund Arcadia\u0027s \u0027worrying\u0027 pension deficit with own moneySir Philip Green\u0027s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresIn the past, the big ones have been inclined to back CVAs - a form of insolvency that allows struggling retailers to secure rent reductions and the closure of unprofitable stores.\u0026nbspIn the current climate the reasoning has been that you either accept less or get nothing. Landlords don’t exactly have queues of replacement tenants lining up outside their doors and it’s usually the smaller owners in smaller towns with less clout that end up with nothing through the closure plans.\u0026nbspThe tycoon had secured the support of British Land and Hammerson and (crucially) pensions watchdogs, but Intu, the big shopping centre owner, said no and so did others.\u0026nbspWith the plans requiring 75 per cent support to go through, their\u0026nbspchances looked more and more slim as the day went on.What made this one so different to the other CVAs\u0026nbspand restructurings that have gone through?\u0026nbspLandlords, including big ones, have been getting increasingly fed up\u0026nbspof retailers putting the burden of their difficulties on to their shoulders.\u0026nbspThey also reasoned that if Sir Philip secured the big rental discounts he\u0027s after then other tenants would demand the same, and perhaps threaten to follow him down the CVA route in time.\u0026nbspIt’s fair to question the role he personally played in all this too, with his aggressive, abrasive style of doing business and the demands he’s made of landlords in the past. This could have contributed to the reluctance of some to give any quarter now he needs their help.

Brexit is greatly exacerbating sector’s problemsClick to followThe IndependentFord is set to close its engine plant in Bridgend next yearSo it’s goodbye Bridgend. With carmaker\u0026nbspFord shutting its engine plant down there, at the direct cost of 1,700 jobs, not to mention all the roles that will be lost in the supply chain, the future for the town looks bleak.\u0026nbspAll that talk about the\u0026nbsp“special relationship” with the US with Donald Trump in town and yet South Wales is losing out to Mexico.\u0026nbspThat’s where the cost advantage lies.\u0026nbspFord to close Bridgend plant in 2020 with loss of 1,700 jobsFears Ford factory could close costing 1,500 jobsFord warns no-deal Brexit will force it to reconsider UK presenceFord is apparently saying it isn’t Brexit. And maybe Bridgend would have been doomed without it. But the company has previously warned that it would have to consider its UK presence in the event of no deal.The problem with Brexit\u0026nbspis that it imposes a cost penalty on every manufacturer in Britain.\u0026nbspThat penalty is theoretical at the moment because we aren’t yet out of the union. But companies like\u0026nbspFord have to look years into the future and without any clear idea about how it will all end up, they’re reliant on worst-case scenarios, such as the imposition WTO style tariffs on goods going in either direction.\u0026nbspWhere the decision on a plant is a marginal one, and even a not so marginal one, Brexit will inevitably tip things over the edge. There is clear evidence that it is already playing a deeply detrimental role when it comes to decisions about investment\u0026nbspmanufacturers are making.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspEY’s regular report into foreign direct investment found a\u0026nbsp35 per cent fall in the money coming into UK manufacturing when compared with 2017.

There are Jaguar’s woes, the closure of Honda’s plant in Swindon, the Sword of Damocles hanging over British Steel.\u0026nbspSet against that, the government’s much-vaunted industrial strategy would be considered a miserable failure except that, as events have rather served to prove, it doesn’t really have one.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocate“If our worst fears are confirmed it will mean disaster for both our members in Bridgend and the community at large, who we will stand by the through thick and thin.“The ironic part is, in the week that Donald Trump is meeting the UK prime minister and talking up a special relationship and trade deal with the UK and the US, if the plant does close the new line is likely to be taken to Mexico by an American company.“So much for the special relationship, Mr Trump.”The Bridgend plant has been under threat because of falling demand for the two engines it makes, and lower projections for the Dragon engine it is scheduled to start making this year. It has been manufacturing engines for 40 years. The site opened in 1980 and covers an area of 60 acres.Ford announced last month it was cutting 7,000 white collar jobs worldwide, with up to 550 expected in the UK.The US manufacturer said the cuts represented 10 per cent of its global salaried workforce and 20 per cent of its management positions.Ford announces 7,000 job cuts globally by end of AugustEverything we know about car technology is changingFigures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) released last week\u0026nbsprevealed that the number of cars built in the UK in April plummeted by almost half compared with a year ago.Just under 71,000 cars rolled off production lines in the month, a fall of 44.5 per cent, as factories shut across the country at the end of March during Brexit uncertainty, the trade association said.Manufacturing for domestic and overseas markets fell by 43.7 per cent and 44.7 per cent respectively as most carmakers brought forward, and extended, production stoppages normally scheduled for the summer holiday period.The SMMT report said April’s “dismal” performance, the 11th straight month of decline, exacerbated the underlying downward trend.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Everyone\u0027s got mortgages to pay and families to support.I expected a little more time to get things sorted.When we found out, everyone was just silent. They gave us letters and we just all went home.It\u0027s hard to take in really, even though we expected it. Now it\u0027s official, it\u0027s a bad thing, really.One worker, who gave the name of Stephen, said: When they came out with the statement, you just don\u0027t take it in do you. But, such is life.The writing has been on the wall for a long time. We knew when the Sigma engine finished there was no replacement. We knew when the AJ engine finished there was no replacement. The predicted volumes for new Dragon engine were 250,000, then 125,000, then the last thing we had was for 70,000.Unions described the news as a “hammer blow” for the community in Bridgend and a “grotesque act of economic betrayal”.The GMB union released an analysis on Thursday showing that the UK has lost half a million manufacturing jobs over the past decade.Ford has announced thousands of job cuts globally\u0026nbspthis year, largely affecting white-collar workers, as the company\u0026nbspseeks to shed unprofitable parts of its business.Brexit could mean more robots in UK manufacturingBrexit prompts slowdown in manufacturing as firms shun UK Video reveals how car manufacturing has changed over 50 yearsBrexit causes record rise in stockpilingUntil recently, the company’s\u0026nbspUK factories had not been thought to be immediately at risk as part of those plans.However, it is understood Ford did not replace a major contract to build engines for Jaguar Land Rover\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspBridgend plant. That work comes to an end next year.Ford also operates a diesel engine plant at Dagenham, east London, and another factory making transmissions in Halewood, near\u0026nbspLiverpool.The Bridgend plant has been under threat because of falling demand for the two engines it makes\u0026nbspand lower projections for the Dragon engine it is scheduled to start making this year. It has been manufacturing engines for 40 years.\u0026nbspFord’s European profits plummeted 82 per cent last year, in part because of a fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016.Jeff Beck, a GMB Union regional organiser, said: “Regardless of today’s announcement GMB will continue to work with Ford, our sister unions and the Welsh government to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news.“What makes it worse is Donald Trump is in this country talking about a possible trade deal between the UK and the US – yet when the plant closes the new line is likely to be produced in Mexico by an American company.”Len McCluskey, the\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of Unite the Union, said: “Ford’s decision to shut its Bridgend engine plant in 2020 is a grotesque act of economic betrayal.Car industry workers want to leave the EU“These workers and this community have stayed faithful to Ford, as have UK customers – this is still Ford’s largest European market – through thick and thin, but have been treated disgracefully in return by this company.“Ford broke promise after promise to the UK. First, it was that it would build 500,000 engines at Bridgend. That fell to a quarter of a million, then fell again and again to now just 80,000. The company has deliberately run down its UK operations so that now not a single Ford vehicle – car or van – is made in the UK.”The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “I am aware of the reports and I understand that they will be very worrying for workers at Bridgend but the reports are unconfirmed by the company so it is not appropriate for me to speculate or comment further at this time.”Carwyn Jones, a\u0026nbspformer Welsh government leader who is currently an assembly member for Bridgend, told the Press Association: “This has all been very sudden. There was no warning about this at all. It seems to me that any decision, whatever that decision is, would have been taken very recently.“From my perspective, I want to know what’s going on as to with the workers and want to know a reason for the decision, and to work with the Welsh government to see what we can do to help the workers here.“It’s the biggest single employer in the area, I remember it being built in the late Seventies. There are relatively few suppliers locally but there are a number of businesses that provide services for the plant itself and they would be severely affected because for a lot of them this is the only contract they have.”Ford announced last month it was cutting 7,000 white-collar jobs worldwide, with up to 550 expected in the UK.The US manufacturer said the cuts represented 10 per cent of its global salaried workforce and 20 per cent of its management positions.A spokesperson for Unite said: “Our priority is our members’ jobs, the communities and livelihoods in the supply chain that Ford Bridgend supports.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We believe that with this adjournment, there is a reasonable prospect of reaching an agreement that the majority of landlords will support.”Shopping centre owner Intu told Arcadia\u0026nbspon Wednesday that it will not back proposals to slash rents and close around 50 stores.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesHowever, big landlords including British Land and Hammerson are said to have backed Arcadia\u0027s Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), with others still wavering.Intu, which owns the Trafford centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, counts Arcadia brands as tenants in 35 of its units.Intu reportedly refused\u0026nbspto back the plans because it would have to justify the rent cuts to other tenants.Landlords are cautious about offering discounts to certain tenants at a time when many retailers under pressure from falling sales, high rents, business rates and increasing wages.\u0026nbspArcadia, which owns brands including Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Evans and Burton had planned to shut 50 UK stores and cut rents on another 194.\u0026nbspJonathan De Mello, a director at retail consultancy Harper Dennis Hobbs, said large landlords feel that Sir Philip has already “played hardball” over rent rises in the past. “The CVA proposal comes in addition to that.\u0026nbsp“Landlords feel that Philip Green wants to get out of certain liabilities but they feel they have reduced rents enough.”If Sir Philip\u0027s Arcadia group\u0026nbspwere to enter administration it would become the most high-profile in a series of retail collapses.Debenhams\u0026nbspand House of Fraser, have called in the administrators in recent months, while Toys R\u0027 Us and Maplin have disappeared completely.Sir Philip Green\u0027s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresSir Philip, once lauded as the king of the high street, cleared a major hurdle on Tuesday after receiving the backing of the Pensions Regulator (TPR) for his rescue plans.The retail mogul agreed to inject\u0026nbspan additional £25m into Arcadia\u0027s\u0026nbsppension fund, taking the total\u0026nbspamount pledged in cash and security to more than £300m.News of\u0026nbspthe agreement came shortly after the watchdog ordered Sir Philip to pay in an extra £50m\u0026nbspin order to secure its support for\u0026nbspArcadia\u0027s CVA.Arcadia said Lady Green, the group\u0027s ultimate owner, had signed off the additional cash.The Pensions Regulator said: Following extensive discussions with the company, shareholders, the trustees of the pension schemes, the PPF and advisers, we are pleased that additional security has been agreed in support for the pension schemes which brings the total security value to £210m.This is in addition to agreed contributions of £100m to be paid to the schemes by Lady Green.Given this enhanced level of support, we now consider the updated CVA proposals are sufficient because they provide better protection for scheme members in these difficult circumstances.We recognise that the best support for any pension scheme is a trading employer and we feel the CVA proposals now provide the right balance between security for the pension schemes and the chance of sustainability for the company.The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is due to vote on whether to support the scheme on Wednesday.Arcadia\u0027s brands have struggled to keep up with changing fashion trends and competition from Primark as well as online rivals.Critics have accused Sir Philip of underinvesting in the group\u0027s stores. The retail mogul also faces a string of allegations of misconduct, which he denies.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some are just minor fixes for long-term annoyances, while others add features that might not be spectacular but alter the way you use your phone.The new update won\u0027t fully arrive until the autumn. But users will be able to get their hands on an early version next month, when the iOS 13 beta opens.Created with Sketch. Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Craig Federighi , Senior Vice President of Software Engineering at Apple, speaks during the keynote address at the Apple World Wide Developers ConferenceCraig Federighi , Senior Vice President of Software Engineering at Apple, speaks during the keynote address at the Apple World Wide Developers ConferenceHere\u0027s a collection of some of those exciting but hidden updates.This is the kind of feature that might make no immediate difference to your life – but could bring substantial improvements over the long term.New iPhone software available –\u0026nbspbut Apple warns users about itIn practise, this presumably means that the phone finds out when you tend to wake up and start using it. It will then know that it doesn\u0027t need to start charging to full until shortly before that, rather than staying at 100 per cent all through the night.That should reduce the stress that the battery undergoes, by staying at full charge. And in turn that change should keep the battery in better health for longer, stopping its performance from reducing in time, as happens naturally.Apple has a general commitment to privacy that has motivated many of the changes in this update: it gives people a way of signing in through Apple, for instance, and avoiding giving more data to Google and Facebook.But one of the less obvious changes in the option to only share your location with an app one time, and forcing it to ask if it wants it again. That will allow you to show your location if required – if you\u0027re posting a photo that you want to be tagged with the restaurant you\u0027re in, for instance – but make sure that untrustworthy apps won\u0027t be able to look up where you are whenever you want.Apple doesn\u0027t make clear how this works. But it\u0027s fairly clear what it does: it tries to cut down on the amount of data the phone will use.It presumably switches various toggles that stops the phone connecting to the internet when it doesn\u0027t need to. Most likely that includes allowing apps to update in the background, for instance.It will prove useful to anyone trying to keep their data usage low, such as when you are getting to the end of the free data in your contract or if you\u0027re on roaming in a foreign country.This is less a positive new feature and more the removal of a negative one. The existing volume indicator – which pops up over videos as yIt\u0027s likely that this one might go missed, simply because a number of apps like Netflix\u0026nbsphave taken matters into their own hands and designed their own volume indicator. But those still using the system one should avoid getting their music interrupted, too.The same change has happened with the indicator of whether the sound is on silent or not. It now just pops down from the top of the screen, rather than taking over the whole thing.Searching through messages on the iPhone has always been a mess: texts don\u0027t show up in the search bar at all, or you can\u0027t click through to find the ones you want to look at.Apple wants to improve this by making the process of searching a little easier. It will now suggests users you might be searching for, or links that people have recently sent and that you might want to have another look at.This is perhaps the most hidden of all the hidden features: it marks a major change in the way iOS works, but it can only be found in the accessibility settings.iOS – particularly the iPad, but it works on the iPhone – now allow you to navigate around by using a mouse. This has always seemed somewhat antithetical to the touchscreen philosophy, but users have long been asking for some version of it.It is presented as an accessibility feature because it can be so useful to people who might otherwise find it difficult to use the touchscreen, such as those who find it difficult to be precise while navigating around. It could also prove likely to people who prefer not to crouch over when using their iPad at a desk, or if they are doing precise browsing that is best done by using a mouse.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 439 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.539 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1339 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1439 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1739 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2139 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2739 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2939 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3139 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3639 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention.

(Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2739 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2939 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3139 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3639 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.“We had an absolute blast but there were certain parts of it where it just got a little bit toxic.”One Direction has been on hiatus since 2016 to allow its members (Payne, Niall Horan, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson) to pursue different projects.Payne, who is now 25 years old, released his first solo EP, titled\u0026nbspFirst Time, in August 2018.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We believe that with this adjournment, there is a reasonable prospect of reaching an agreement that the majority of landlords will support.”Shopping centre owner Intu told Arcadia\u0026nbspon Wednesday that it will not back proposals to slash rents and close around 50 stores.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesHowever, big landlords including British Land and Hammerson are said to have backed Arcadia\u0027s Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), with others still wavering.Intu, which owns the Trafford centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, counts Arcadia brands as tenants in 35 of its units.Intu reportedly refused\u0026nbspto back the plans because it would have to justify the rent cuts to other tenants.Landlords are cautious about offering discounts to certain tenants at a time when many retailers under pressure from falling sales, high rents, business rates and increasing wages.\u0026nbspArcadia, which owns brands including Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Evans and Burton had planned to shut 50 UK stores and cut rents on another 194.\u0026nbspJonathan De Mello, a director at retail consultancy Harper Dennis Hobbs, said large landlords feel that Sir Philip has already “played hardball” over rent rises in the past. “The CVA proposal comes in addition to that.\u0026nbsp“Landlords feel that Philip Green wants to get out of certain liabilities but they feel they have reduced rents enough.”If Sir Philip\u0027s Arcadia group\u0026nbspwere to enter administration it would become the most high-profile in a series of retail collapses.Debenhams\u0026nbspand House of Fraser, have called in the administrators in recent months, while Toys R\u0027 Us and Maplin have disappeared completely.Sir Philip Green\u0027s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresSir Philip, once lauded as the king of the high street, cleared a major hurdle on Tuesday after receiving the backing of the Pensions Regulator (TPR) for his rescue plans.The retail mogul agreed to inject\u0026nbspan additional £25m into Arcadia\u0027s\u0026nbsppension fund, taking the total\u0026nbspamount pledged in cash and security to more than £300m.News of\u0026nbspthe agreement came shortly after the watchdog ordered Sir Philip to pay in an extra £50m\u0026nbspin order to secure its support for\u0026nbspArcadia\u0027s CVA.Arcadia said Lady Green, the group\u0027s ultimate owner, had signed off the additional cash.The Pensions Regulator said: Following extensive discussions with the company, shareholders, the trustees of the pension schemes, the PPF and advisers, we are pleased that additional security has been agreed in support for the pension schemes which brings the total security value to £210m.This is in addition to agreed contributions of £100m to be paid to the schemes by Lady Green.Given this enhanced level of support, we now consider the updated CVA proposals are sufficient because they provide better protection for scheme members in these difficult circumstances.We recognise that the best support for any pension scheme is a trading employer and we feel the CVA proposals now provide the right balance between security for the pension schemes and the chance of sustainability for the company.The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is due to vote on whether to support the scheme on Wednesday.Arcadia\u0027s brands have struggled to keep up with changing fashion trends and competition from Primark as well as online rivals.Critics have accused Sir Philip of underinvesting in the group\u0027s stores. The retail mogul also faces a string of allegations of misconduct, which he denies.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It felt cruel and humiliating. It’s 2019 – you can’t have people doing that to you. It’s just wrong.Mr Byrne said he had arrived at Dublin airport at 6.45pm, leaving plenty of time to tell staff from OCS – the company that operates the lift for disabled passengers – that he required assistance to get on his flight at 8.50pm.He said there had been “a slight delay of around five minutes” getting the lift ready to take him on board before he was told the pilot was refusing to take him on board.After being denied his place on the plane, he had to wait over two-and-a-half hours to board the next one leaving for Birmingham.This government is failing disabled children and their familiesMr Byrne is paraplegic, meaning that he has an impairment in motor or sensory function of the lower extremities. Mr Byrne said long hours of chair sitting can increase the risk of pressure sores.“The next flight was delayed until 11.30pm, so I didn’t finally get back home to Nottingham until 2.30am,” he said. “The whole journey from Dublin city centre took around nine hours. I could have gone to America in that time.”He added: “I haven’t had a good explanation. The pilot must have seen me waiting on the lift. It takes five minutes to lift me on.”“I’ve been all over the world to represent Team GB and haven’t had anything like this happen before. I certainly want to get apology. More than anything else, I want to make sure it doesn’t happen to anyone else.”Mr Byrne said he had received an email from Ryanair saying the company was now investigating.A\u0026nbspRyanair\u0026nbspspokesperson told The Independent: “While we regret any inconvenience caused, special assistance services at Dublin Airport are operated by OCS – at great expense to the airlines.”A spokesperson for OCS said the company had no comment to make.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Theresa May said she wouldn’t stand down until we had left the EU, and David Cameron said he wouldn’t publish his memoir. Both those events are now going to take place while we are still an EU member, but Adam Hills, presenter of The Last Leg, is still growing his beard and, as far as I know, Jake Berry, the local government minister, is still not drinking.\u0026nbspAnd Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, confirmed today that the end of austerity, too, has been postponed until after the Brexit crisis has been resolved. As we report today, she told a House of Lords committee that the public spending review promised for this autumn is now “unlikely to happen”.\u0026nbspTheresa May said at the Conservative Party conference in October (the one where she danced onto the stage): “A decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over.”The trouble with relaxing a squeeze on public spending is that it takes a long time for the public to feel it. The Labour government struggled to convince people that things did actually “get better” after it turned on the spending taps in 1999 – having raised expectations in the 1997 election, it kept to stringent Tory spending plans for two years and even after that it took longer than expected for the benefits to be felt in wards and classrooms.\u0026nbspTory turmoil will slam brakes on pledge to end austerity, admits TrussNow the Conservatives seem to have repeated that mistake. The prime minister announced the end of austerity before the new money had started to flow. She has made eye-catching promises of vast extra spending on the NHS, outbidding the Leave campaign’s £350m a week on the side of the bus by promising an extra £394m a week by 2023. But most of this money is some way into the future, and now the spending review, which would have set out spending plans for all departments over the next three years, has been postponed.\u0026nbspThat means that\u0026nbspmost departments face an immediate future in which budgets will only just keep up with inflation. This is better than the year-on-year cuts in real spending (except in the protected budgets for health, defence and aid)\u0026nbspduring the coalition government.\u0026nbspBut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to announce an emergency top-up to the Home Office’s policing budget in his spring statement in March, and there are still large cuts in the social security budget pencilled in to be made as universal credit is extended.\u0026nbspOf course, the delay to this autumn’s spending review is not directly the result of the postponement of Brexit. It is the change of prime minister – or, as Truss put it, the “goings-on within the Conservative Party” – that means the review has been put off. The new prime minister, expected to take office in the week beginning 22 July, will want to reset the government’s spending priorities.\u0026nbspWhoever it is, they will want to reannounce the “end of austerity”. But it may be several years before most of the British people will feel it.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s why we support a Final Say on BrexitAnd they challenged the invocation of wartime patriotism by the Leave camp, pointing out that it was Sir Winston Churchill who called for the creation of a “European family” to prevent another descent into bloodshed.Churchill’s words helped inspire the creation of the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union with “one main purpose - to create lasting peace by entwining our economies and societies together on a continent once ravaged by war,” they said.“Nato does not keep the peace in Europe – it keeps peace for Europe. It is the EU that keeps peace in Europe, because when you trade, you do not fight.Created with Sketch.D-Day 75: Normandy landings in pictures Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

There is a clear majority in the House of Commons against a no-deal exit.\u0026nbspAs the prime minister was forced towards resignation\u0026nbspafter her failure to deliver Brexit, the word “prorogation” came back to life as an option for her successor.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson gave the idea rocket boosters when he said, the day after Ms May announced her departure, that, if he were prime minister, “we will leave the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal”.The immediate question was: if the EU refused to change the deal, and parliament remained opposed both to the deal and to a no-deal exit, how?\u0026nbspIf the incoming prime minister, whether Mr Johnson, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom or Esther McVey,\u0026nbsprules out a further extension beyond 31 October, their options are few. They could hope by force of personality to persuade MPs to vote either for a cosmetically revised deal or for a no-deal exit. Neither of those seems likely.Gove says he would consider further delay to Brexit to secure dealOr they could try to call an immediate general election, fight it on a no-deal policy and hope to have a no-deal majority in the Commons by the end of October. I think that is more likely than many people realise.\u0026nbspNot least because the only other way of taking the UK out of the EU without a deal would be to suspend parliament, using the device of prorogation that has been seized on by armchair constitutional lawyers.\u0026nbspAs any belligerent Brexit Party supporter on social media will tell you, the legal default is that the UK leaves the EU on 31 October. So, how to take parliament out of the picture, to stop it preventing us from leaving?\u0026nbspProrogation is an antique and decorative feature of our constitution-by-convention. From Latin prorogare, “prolong, extend”, it is a sort of limbo into which parliament is consigned between sessions or just before it is dissolved for an election.\u0026nbspThe Queen prorogues parliament on the advice of the prime minister, so it is a government decision that does not need parliamentary approval. However, in the past, parliament has tried to vote against prorogation – a Labour attempt to do so was defeated in the House of Lords during the handover from Harold Macmillan to Alec Douglas-Home as prime minister in 1963.If such a vote were to be carried in the Commons against the government, it would have no legal force, although no prime minister with honour could ignore it. As honour may not be a decisive consideration, however, we can expect the shadow government of Dominic Grieve, Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin to pass a law requiring a Commons vote for prorogation.John Bercow, the speaker, has made it clear that they would be able to legislate from the backbenches if necessary. Today he was emphatic in ruling out prorogation as an option: “Parliament will not be evacuated from the centre stage of the decision-making process on this important matter. That is simply not going to happen.”The suspension of parliamentary democracy ought to be unthinkable, but it appears not to be. Some Leavers argue that the referendum mandate overrides parliamentary democracy. But it hardly matters whether Tory leadership candidates rule prorogation in or out. It is not going to happen.The most plausible route to a no-deal Brexit, therefore, is an October election, as chaotic and unpredictable as it might be. That could well happen.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company is the largest supermarket chain in the world by revenues.Created with Sketch.The Democrat challengers to Trump in 2020 Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Vermont senator has announced that he will be running again in 2020 after losing out to Hilary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries.

But it remains lower than the $15 an hour Amazon pays employees. Retailers Target Corp and Costco also pay higher rates than Walmart.Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said Walmart had raised wages in the United States by 50 per cent in the past four years and continued to increase wages on a market-by-market basis to hire and retain talent.“We are not perfect, but together we are learning, we are listening and changing,” he said.Walmart has said it pays an average of $17.50 an hour to its hourly employees, including benefits.The proposal presented by Mr Sanders was unlikely to pass the Walton family owns a majority of shares and the retailer had asked shareholders to vote against it.Mr Sanders said Mr McMillon, the chief executive, was “making a thousand times more than the average Walmart employee”. He said the ratio of Mr\u0026nbsp​McMillon’s $23.6m pay package last year compared to that of the median associate was 1,076 to 1.“Walmart is the largest private employer in America and is owned by the Walton family, the wealthiest family in the United States, worth approximately $175bn,” Mr Sanders said.\u0026nbspBernie Sanders demands Walmart ‘give workers a seat on the board’Joe Biden’s lead shrinks to zero against Bernie Sanders in IowaBernie Sanders unveils 2020 election plan to reform public educationBernie Sanders’ views should disqualify him from running for presidentBernie Sanders and AOC propose credit card interest rate caps“And yet, despite the incredible wealth of its owners, Walmart pays many of its employees starvation wages.”Last year, Mr Sanders introduced legislation intended to tax big companies the full amount of welfare claimed by their workers because of the low-wages they received.Titled the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act, Mr Sanders took direct aim at companies such as Amazon and its owner Jeff Bezos. While Mr Bezos’ wealth stood at $168bn, the Vermont senator said, many of his employees were forced to use food stamps.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The slogan is a play on the Japanese words for shoes “kutsu” and pain “kutsuu”.Speaking about the petition at a\u0026nbspparliamentary committee on Wednesday, Mr Nemoto demurred on whether requiring women to wear high heels constituted an “abuse of power”.Created with Sketch.Japan in bloom: cherry blossoms in 2019 Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cherry blossom-watching on the Meguro RiverBlossom along the Meguro River in TokyoIlluminated cherry trees with the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower in the distanceIlluminated cherry trees along the Meguro RiverCherry blossom along the Chidorigafuchi MoatAdmiring cherry blossoms during a tea ceremony in YokohamaTaking a selfie underneath the cherry blossom in YokohamaJapanese Emperor Akihito, left, and Empress Michiko see weeping cherry in KyotoCherry blossom in Asakusa, TokyoCherry blossom-watching on the Meguro RiverBlossom along the Meguro River in TokyoIlluminated cherry trees with the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower in the distanceIlluminated cherry trees along the Meguro RiverCherry blossom along the Chidorigafuchi MoatAdmiring cherry blossoms during a tea ceremony in YokohamaTaking a selfie underneath the cherry blossom in YokohamaJapanese Emperor Akihito, left, and Empress Michiko see weeping cherry in KyotoCherry blossom in Asakusa, Tokyo“It is socially accepted as something that falls within the realm of being occupationally necessary and appropriate,” he said.“Whether the employers’ requirement to wear high heels is an abuse of power or not depends on whether the requirement goes beyond the social understanding of what is necessary and appropriate.”He was responding to Kanako Otsuji, a member of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, who said forcing women to wear high heels in the workplace is “outdated”. She emphasised that a dress code which only applies\u0026nbspto women amounts to harassment.The petition was started by Tokyo artist and writer Yumi Ishikawa after comments she made on Twitter went viral across the nation. She came up with the hashtag #KuToo in her tweets.“I’m hoping to get rid of the custom that someday women have to wear heels and pumps at work,” she wrote in January.Japanese women are fighting against high heel requirements at workAn official at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare’s equal-employment opportunity ision said earlier that there were no plans to amend the laws around whether employers could require staff to wear particular shoes or clothes. There are currently no laws that constrain firms from regulating employees’ workwear.\u0026nbspJapan has recently found itself in the public eye for failing to recognise gender equality in the wake of the global #MeToo movement.The issue of sexual harassment continues to be prevalent in the country. A recent survey of 1,000 working women found that 42.5 per cent had experienced sexual harassment and that more than 60 per cent did not report it.Japan ranks bottom among the G7 countries for gender equality. A number of medical universities in the east Asian country last year admitted to meddling with entrance exam scores to deliberately put female applicants at a disadvantage.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the family does not get the support it needs.Thousands of kind-hearted Sun readers have already signed Vickey’s letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond demanding he properly funds services — such as respite and overnight support — for parents with disabled children.We hope more of you will show your backing by signing the letter today, because the Kowal family are not an isolated case.Mums and dads up and down the country feel unable to look after their disabled children adequately because they are so exhausted — and they are frustrated at being let down by a system that is meant to help them.When we surveyed parents, just four per cent said they felt they had the support to safely care for their child.More than half have been treated by a GP for depression, anxiety or stress.Ollies grandad Dave helps out when he can, but the family are far from an isolated case - they need your helpIndependent Provider of Special Education Advice- for specialist legal adviceNewle - a charity that provides help with equipmentGOV.UK - to understand your childs entitlementsNational Autistic Society And a huge  per cent of children have gone without therapies, such as physio and speech and language help, meant to improve their lives.This lack of support starts right from diagnosis — with parents being left alone to come to terms with devastating news.They are then left to care for children with complex needs — often through the night — for months or years without any help or respite.This care is often emotional and stressful, and sometimes physical and back-breaking, too.At my charity, Contact — which works with families of disabled children — we hear all the time from those who have to fight for even the most basic provision.Disabled children and their families are desperately struggling because of a lack of support.We want the Government to reinstate the £m of funding it has cut from early intervention services - such as respite care and vital equipment.It is time for the Government to Give It Back.The number of disabled children in the UK has risen to nearly  million over the past  years - up by a third.But funding and support has been cut.Families with some of the most vulnerable children in the country are struggling to cope.That’s why we’re working with the Disabled Children’s Partnership to help them.Together we can make a real dference and hugely improve the lives of disabled children and their families.We want you to share your stories, email us on giveitback@the-sunPlease sign Ollie’s letter to put pressure on the Government to act now.These families are morally — and legally — entitled to help from local authorities, but it is just not forthcoming.It does not need to be like this. All the families want is a little amount of support to enable them to care safely for their child at home.They want a chance to go shopping, a moment to catch up on sleep or have a bath, or time to spend with their other children.This is not about pity or sympathy for disabled children.The families we work with cherish every day spent with their children, who bring real joy and have so much to offer. Instead, we are calling on the Government to help tackle the problem of the lack of support they are given.I have worked in the field of disability for  years, so I know that services have never been perfect.But cuts to budgets, combined with a  per cent increase in the number of children classed as disabled over the past decade, means we have reached a critical point — one where we need to decide what kind of country we want to be.We are talking about some of the most vulnerable children in society, and also children who have the potential to contribute a lot.This is not a campaign based purely on emotion, compassion or wanting to do the right thing, although those are all important.There is a hard-headed economic case here, too. Without putting funding back into services for disabled children, we can guarantee the taxpayer will be faced with a bigger bill in the long-term.That is because when families break down, children can end up in care or needing expensive crisis intervention from local councils or the NHS.Our families are amazing. When the chips are down, people can be remarkable.But most do not want to be amazing, or superhuman — they want an ordinary le.As Sun readers, you can give families up and down the country a real shot at that.Sign Vickey’s letter using this link, and ask which of our potential leaders will be first to agree to Give It Back.Amanda Batten is chair of the Disabled Children’s Partnership, a coalition of  leading charities, and CEO of Contact.Jane Harris, Director of External Affairs at the National Autistic SocietyWe want as many people as possible to sign the open letter calling on the Government to give back the millions that have been cut from support for disabled children.

In  she found herself making models of coastal towns and villages.“We studied aerial photographs through stereoscopes and made buildings out of linoleum, cut to shape with razor blades and inserted in place with eyebrows tweezers.“Roads, rivers and railways were painted on, with coloured sawdust representing woods and scrublands,” she remembered.“We had no idea what these were for, but on the morning of  June , as we sat at breakfast, the invasion was announced over our crackly old radio. There was complete silence and then we cheered and cheered until the tears ran – so that’s what it’s all been about”.The assault troops were equally kept in the dark until the last minute.They had learned the layout of their destinations and what they looked like, but were not told any names or whereabouts, until at sea and crossing the Channel.On board their warships, troops were issued a pile of five Franc notes, and immediately set up card games and gaming tables.Some gambled their way through the night, but the message from the money was clear: “So it was going to be France, then”.With the “invasion money” were recognition booklets, containing the postcards, holiday snaps and wave-height pictures, taken by British submarines.American Sergeant Valentine Miele, bound for Omaha Beach, remembered “the postcards, each one with a dferent picture of our beach”.As the postcards tumbled out of Uncle Reggie’s shoe box, each told a story:This church at Sainte Mère Église was where American paratroopers of the US nd Airborne Division would land, blown off course by the wind. Private John Steele’s parachute would get snagged on the steeple.Here was the shingle of Coleville-sur-Mer, the future Omaha Beach. Canadian warriors at Juno Beach would head for these timber-framed beach villas.British tanks would rumble down this track at Sword beach between the houses, where holiday makers had parked their cars.At Ouistreham, French commandos would attack German bunkers built on top the ornate Casino. The gaming house had been partly demolished, but the setting was the same.Looking at the postcards of a bygone era, for the first time I understood how the Home Front had made a vital contribution to the success of D-Day -  their holiday memories providing vital,unlikely, ammunition in this most brutal of wars.Sand  Steel: A New History of D-Day by Peter Caddick-Adams is published by Cornerstone. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Legislation in Australia has also led to thousands more having the jab, she said.She added that although “many parents wrongly believe the rhetoric that vaccines are harmful, unnatural and an infringement of civil liberties”, a no jab, no school rule would give parents freedom of choice, while protecting other youngsters from infection.Health secretary Matt Hancock has said that he is “particularly worried” about fake posts on social media and last month refused to rule out mandatory jabs.But other doctors argue that making the jab mandatory could erode trust in the NHS and turn parents against vaccination.While the infectious condition often clears up in under two weeks, it can sometimes lead to le-threatening complications.Public Health England has confirmed the UK has seen a rise in cases in , with  confirmed cases of measles so far this year, compared to just  for the whole of .Health experts have said it is part of a rise in cases across Europe.The illness is highly contagious and is easily spread from person to person.Viruses can be expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezing.These can then be inhaled by someone who comes into contact with droplets, which may remain in the air or settle on a surface.Spending just  minutes with someone who has measles can lead to the disease spreading.What are the symptoms Approximately  days after the illness is contracted, signs become noticeable.The NHS outlines the initial symptoms of measles…A few days after these flu-like symptoms manest, a rash often begins to appear.Distinctive red-brown blotches spring up on the body, typically beginning at the upper neck and spreading downwards.Severe complications can occur, including miscarriage in pregnant women, brain swelling and the risk of death from pneumonia.Dr David Elliman, of London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital, told the BMJ that the UK should concentrate on making it easier for children to get immunised.This could be by putting on vaccination sessions at family-friendly times and giving the jab to kids in AE.He said: “Only when these components are in place should we consider mandatory vaccination.”The MMR jab is free for adults and kids on the NHS.Its important to have two doses to have full cover against measles, mumps and rubella. The jabs can be given a month apart."},{"url":null,"title":"labour left working class voters","story":"I didn’t mean to, she was just there when I came in the room and I couldn’t find the remote. She had that very self-satisfied expression on her face.Then to stop the interviewer, Piers Morgan, asking her dficult questions, she started gabbling idiocies at  words per second. Like a maling Chatty Cathy doll. It was hilarious. Jabber The Hutt.She made no sense whatsoever. She appeared deranged.Thornberry is the best Labour has to offer. She is easily the most persuasive and talented member of Magic Grandpa’s frontbench. Yes, sure, that isn’t saying much. But here she was utterly lost.And you could see, as she wittered on, the end in sight for a great political party. One I was proud to be a member of for  years. A party which was once great, but now makes no sense whatsoever. A party suffused with hypocrisy.Thornberry was trying to explain why Jeremy Corbyn and the party were so hostile to Donald Trump. And she had no answer. How could she, when Corbyn is happy to call terrorists his friends — but has no time for the democratically elected leader of the free world When Corbyn and his cronies offer support for Socialist catastrophes such as Venezuela. Or totalitarian dictatorships such as Cuba, where trade unionists and homosexuals are imprisoned.Under Corbyn Labour has become a party of educationally challenged, far-left, perpetual adolescents, hostile not only to all of Britain’s allies but to Britain itself. It no longer represents the working class it was set up to protect. If it represents anyone at all it is the affluent, virtue-signalling, metropolitan middle class. And even they are drting away from Labour, appalled by its rank anti-Semitism.This genuinely could be the end of Labour. Despite the worst Government in living memory, it still struggles to hold a lead in the polls. In the Euro elections it was beaten out of sight by the Lib Dems and lost ten seats. Unheard of for the official opposition party! It’s only a matter of time before the Greens overtake Labour.Labour dumped the working class because it thought it could rely on the host of tribes in the UK, some of whom consider themselves victims. Gays, transgender people, Muslims, feminists, black and ethnic minorities.But the trouble is, those supposed “victims” do not agree with each other, or wish to be portrayed as victims.Some radical feminists don’t like the transgender activists, some Muslims don’t have much time for the gays or the feminists. So the whole thing has fallen apart. And it has fallen apart because it is based on a fallacy.Some Labour MPs have already deserted the party to join the hilarious Change UK.They would have been better off joining the Lib Dems. Other decent Labour MPs — Kate Hoey, Frank Field, Caroline Flint — soldier on in the hope that Magic Grandpa will one day be gone. They’ve been hoping that for four years, but there’s no sign of it happening. The truth is, the party is lost to them.Many commentators have suggested that Brexit may see the end of the Tory Party.So it might. But more surely, it will see the end of the Labour Party. It is ideologically bankrupt. It has outlived its useful purpose.THE Brexit Party looks set to win today’s important by-election in Peterborough.People are rightly furious that the liberal establishment and the major parties have effectively thwarted the people’s will. They want to teach Labour and the Conservatives a lesson.I voted for Nigel Farage’s party in the Euro elections – but I wouldn’t dream of doing so in Peterborough.They have no policies, other than Brexit. And their candidate is making stuff up on the hoof. Champagne for everyone! This is utterly dishonest.The truth Nigel and Co are not telling voters is that the Brexit Party is deeply hostile to the working class.Farage has talked about privatising the NHS. He has no time for nationalising our energy companies, or decreasing the ide between rich and poor in our country.OK, I’m biased – as you can see from the above photo. Butyou are a Leave voter but care about social equality too, there’s only one candidate to vote for in Peterborough – Patrick O’Flynn of the SDP.CONGRATS to Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy on the birth of their baby boy.Crouchie joked the kid would be called Divock Samrat, after the Liverpool striker Origi and his favourite curry house.Abbey’s not having it, though.So here’s a thought – what about Roderick  Nobody calls their kids Roderick any more.Actually, nobody ever did, apart from my mum and dad. And I was lucky, it was almost Sebastian.THE Conservative Party is dying on its feet. But there are still plenty of munchkins who fancy being its boss.There were a dozen candidates until Tuesday, when one bloke I’ve never heard of pulled out.Several more people nobody has heard of fancy a go. Boris Johnson is favourite, of course – but the Tories are weird people and rarely,ever, choose the front runner.If they’re sensible they’ll go for someone who is actually conservative – someone like Esther McVey. Or Priti Patelshe chucks her hat in the ring.C’mon Priti, everybody  seems to be having a go.LOUIS Farrakhan is a foul piece of work.A vile Muslim rabble rouser from the United States and deeply anti-semitic. He has described Judaism as a “gutter religion”.He has called Jewish people “bloodsuckers”. And he described Adolf Hitler as being a “great man.”So who would defend a piece of crap like this  Who would say of him: “Mr Farrakhan is not anti-Semitic and does not preach a message of racial hatred and antagonism” Step right up – Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, and the man who has spent the last couple of years flinging insults at Donald Trump.You know where you are with the Labour Party, don’t you Always available to support Jew-haters or anyone who despises our culture and way of le.Always available to be contemptuous of our friends and allies.DID you see the face of that woman protesting about Donald Trump’s visit She is called Siobhan and screamed “Nazi!” at a bloke who was supporting the US President.It was a face contorted with hatred, full of rage and spite.

Successive governments have taken it to mean rents or purchase costs which are lower than in the open market.But paying rents of, say, % of the market level is still far beyond the means of many who need a home.At a time of national concern about levels of poverty and inequality, our Commission wanted to find out how peoples housing costs are fuelling the situation.We have looked at the scale of the problem and redefined measures of affordability, to take into account the impact it has on peoples lives, looking at what people can pay for housing without risking financial and personal issues.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Can Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party win this core Middle Britain seat Dficult, but it would be a heck of a result and could do to those insects in Westminster what a dose of Sarson’s does to the winged pests that erupt from house walls on hot days.EvenFarage does not pull off a cup upset in Peterborough, Westminster is starting to get jumpy. About time, too! Theresa May quits the Tory leadership tomorrow and the race to succeed her has begun with almost as many runners as the Grand National.Quite a few of them will end up in the glue factory.Prince Charles’s pro-EU pal Rory Stewart, the little-known International Development Secretary, has made a wonderful fool of himself by standing for the job. Stewart has filmed selfie videos presenting himself as man-of-the-masses, in places such as, er, genteel Kew Gardens.Deluded commentators in the Westminster village have praised his social-media “outreach”. It’s the political elite’s echo chamber at work again.On Tuesday evening Stewart stood on a box at Speaker’s Corner in London’s Hyde Park, to “speak to the people”. What a gumby. The only bystanders at Speaker’s Corner these days are tourists, ice-cream vendors and a few winos.If Stewart really wants to meet the people to see what they think of his plan to soften Brexit to the point of non-existence, he should haul himself off to somewhere like Asda in Walsall, in the West Midlands.Brummies would soon let him know exactly what they thought of his proposal to ignore the  referendum’s .million Leave voters.Meanwhile, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock , polished his credentials to be Tory leader by releasing a video of himself playing office cricket with a few of his civil servants. I had to watch this stunt twice just to make sure it wasn’t a spoof from Armando Iannucci, one of the sharp comic brains behind Alan Partridge.Not that Hancock is the silliest of the bunch. Sam Gyimah, an obscure former junior minister, was last night persisting with his leadership campaign even though he did not have the declared support of a single MP .This was almost pathetic in the proper sense of the word — ie enough to make you feel sad for the bloke. But in the end I’m afraid my heart remained unmoved. Gyimah simply looked a prat.Labour’s comrades are at each other’s throats, the Lib Dems have their own leadership contestand the Change UK brigade, just a few weeks after their creation, are disintegrating like one of strongman Geoff Capes’s deckchairs. More than half of them quit, leaving a rump that will be led by spluttering Anna Soubry, as shouty as a Jack Russell snapping at a postie’s ankles.All this was happening while Hurricane Trump blew into town and gave half-pint London Mayor Sadiq Khan a few home truths. The President also showed Jeremy Corbyn to be two-faced, revealing that Corbyn — who happily joined a rally where Trump was slandered as a fascist — had begged him for a one-to-one meeting. The crawler.Looking at this turmoil, you might think: “That’s it, I’m emigrating to strong, stable Venezuela.” Don’t book your ticket to Caracas just yet.Call me a crazy optimist, but I think the mayhem in our politics is healthy — a sign that it’s finally sinking into Westminster’s blockheads that they need to start reflecting and stop blocking public opinion.Theresa May first. The PM’s departure was so often predicted that it is hard to believe she and husband Philip are finally emptying their smalls drawers at No.But after her tearful announcement two weeks ago in Downing Street, there is no way back for Madam Glumbucket. A nation mourns  Don’t let’s put it that strongly but nor should we gloat.Allow her a decent adieu. She occupied high office with dignity and seriousness and was not tacky, like some recent PMs. There was no Carole Caplin or Lord Levy in her coterie, thank goodness.If that was an example of politicians learning from their predecessors’ mistakes, might the same be happening with the EU crisis  Tory and Labour MPs have been terried by the rise of Farage’s Brexit Party.Peterborough was a swing seat won by Labour in  by now-disgraced Fiona Onasanya, jailed after trying to cheat a motoring offence.Whatever the result, the Peterborough campaign showed that neither of the two main parties can take Middle Britain for granted.That has made northern Labour MPs wary of seeking a second referendum. And it has caused a big change in the Tory leadership election campaign.Front-runner Boris Johnson and his main rivals Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab and Sajid Javid are all being much more ballsy about a No Deal Brexit.The three Remain candidates — Hancock, Stewart and Gyimah — are trailing badly. It is hard to say who will win but , as likely, it is Boris, Gove or Raab, the next PM should be much more in tune with public opinion.Meanwhile, the determinedly anti-Brexit Tory MP Phillip Lee looks doomed after a row with his activists in Bracknell. The people are revolting!With an opinion poll having now suggested that the Brexit Party may have a national lead, MPs on both sides of the Commons are finally clocking the possibility that they could lose their seats.Ouch. That’s the sting of vinegar in their eyes. It’s the only remedy for their arrogance. Folks, keep squirting. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nothing can ever break ties that have been bound in bloodshed and shared values.The debates taking place today cannot affect the strength of our joint history and our shared future.Normandy veteran and patron of The Normandy Trust George Batts told the crowd: They were the soldiers of democracy.They were the men of D-Day and to them we owe our freedom.After the memorial inauguration, Theresa May joined veterans and the Prince of Wales at a cathedral service in Bayeux.Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry are also attending the service of remembrance.The city, close to the northern French coast, was the first major place to be liberated after the Allied forces invasion.Following the service, veterans will parade from the cathedral to the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery.Dignitaries will be invited to lay memorial wreaths and the last post will be played at the site where more than , war dead are buried.Ron Tungatt knew he had a crucial role in the engine room of landing vessel  in .As a -year-old, Pixie Jenkins, who was in Womens Royal Naval Service, helped drive troops and equipment to Newhaven Docks in East Sussex in the the build-up to D-Day and throughout the Normandy landings.Ernest Green, , and Robert Barnett, , were both on HMS Redpole when it sailed to Juno Beach on June  .Sid Barnes, , from Norfolk, served in the Royal Army Service Corps and landed on beach by Arromanches on June .At the start of the service, a message on behalf of Pope Francis was read by Cardinal Marc Ouellet.He said D-Day was decisive in the fight against Nazi barbarism and paid tribute to those who joined the Army and gave their lives for freedom and peace.The great grandson of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, Randolph Churchill, has also paid tribute to those who took part in the D-Day landings.Its remarkable to think that  years ago the heroes that gave us our freedom were coming up these shores, he told ITVs Good Morning Britain.With the veterans here today -

an experience she described as humiliating and degrading.According to reports in Holland, medics last week agreed to no longer attempt to feed the teenager.She was instead provided with palliative care in a hospital bed set up in her living room.Last year, Noas parents told a Dutch newspaper that they were opposed to allowing their daughter to die - after the teenager was turned down by a euthanasia clinic.It is not clear how the youngsters circumstances changed between then and last weekend.Cases like Noa’s, where treatment is withheld, are sometimes referred to as “passive euthanasia”.However, Tom Davies, Director of Campaigns and Communications at Dignity in Dying, told The Sun Online that the term does not have any legal weight and is more of a medical ethics term.Responding to initial reports that the teens death was the result of  euthanasia Mr Davies said: I think we would say it wasnt euthanasia because that would be like saying everyone who has le sustaining treatment withdrawn from them in the UK is having passive euthanasia.In the UK, you can refuse le sustaining treatmentyou are mentally competent.That would include a breathing tube for someone who couldnt breath unaided but would also include a feeding tube for someone who couldnt eat without aid.Or it could include a feeding tube for someone who did not consent to being fed but was being forced fed through some other means.He added that invasive feeding would be classed as le sustaining treatment in the Dutch teenagers case.Noa had previously been hospitalised multiple times by her anorexia and on one occasion suffered organ failure, forcing doctors to put her into a medically-induced coma.The -year-old said feelings of shame had prevented her from reporting the abuse she had suffered to the police until years after it had occurred.She later penned an award-winning autobiography, called Winning or Learning, detailing her struggles with mental health, which included attempted suicides.Explaining her decision to end her le to Dutch newspaper the Gelderland last year, Noa said: Out of fear and shame, I relive the fear, that pain every day. Always scared, always on my guard. And to this day my body still feels dirty.My house has been broken into, my body, that can never be undone.If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems, the following organisations provide support:The day before she died, she posted a message to her followers on Instagram: “I deliberated for quite a while whether or not I should share this, but decided to do it anyway.“Maybe this comes as a surprise to some, given my posts about hospitalisation, but my plan has been there for a long time and is not impulsive.“I will get straight to the point: within a maximum of  days I will die. After years of battling and fighting, I am drained.”“I have quit eating and drinking for a while now, and after many discussions and evaluations, it was decided to let me go because my suffering is unbearable.”“I breathe, but I no longer live.”She then asked her friends not to “convince me that this is not good, this is my decision and it is final. Love is letting go, in this case.”Dutch minister Lisa Westerveld, who first made contact with Noa in December after her newspaper interview, visited the -year-old before she died.She said: It was nice to see her again. It is also very unreal. Noa was incredibly strong and very open. I will never forget her. We will continue her struggle.Hollands Health minister Hugo de Jonge today dismissed reports that the teen has died as a result of euthanasia.He said: We are in touch with her family, who have told us that, despite international media reports to the contrary, there is no question of euthanasia in this case.If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems the Samaritans can be contacted on  , or visit Mind’s website Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I love you with all my heart. Have a good trip, dear Noa.Noa penned an award-winning autobiography, called Winning or Learning, detailing her struggles with mental health, which included attempted suicides.Explaining her decision to end her le to Dutch newspaper the Gelderland last year, Noa said: Out of fear and shame, I relive the fear, that pain every day. Always scared, always on my guard. And to this day my body still feels dirty.My house has been broken into, my body, that can never be undone.If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems, the following organisations provide support:The day before she died, she posted a message to her followers on Instagram: “I deliberated for quite a while whether or not I should share this, but decided to do it anyway.“Maybe this comes as a surprise to some, given my posts about hospitalisation, but my plan has been there for a long time and is not impulsive.“I will get straight to the point: within a maximum of  days I will die. After years of battling and fighting, I am drained.”“I have quit eating and drinking for a while now, and after many discussions and evaluations, it was decided to let me go because my suffering is unbearable.”“I breathe, but I no longer live.”She then asked her friends not to “convince me that this is not good, this is my decision and it is final. Love is letting go, in this case.”Dutch minister Lisa Westerveld, who first made contact with Noa in December after her newspaper interview, visited the -year-old before she died.She said: It was nice to see her again. It is also very unreal. Noa was incredibly strong and very open. I will never forget her. We will continue her struggle.Hollands Health minister Hugo de Jonge today dismissed reports that the teen has died as a result of euthanasia.He said: We are in touch with her family, who have told us that, despite international media reports to the contrary, there is no question of euthanasia in this case.If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems the Samaritans can be contacted on  , or visit Mind’s website Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s been like that since series one.It’s just that this year’s contestants forced them to be even more credulous, gushing and moronic than usual.Particularly the magicians, who were all doing iations on the same trick, with such little stagecraft, that one of last year’s rejects, Marc Spelmann, was deemed best of the bunch by virtue of putting on his X mask and saying nothing.It didn’t end there, however.Critical faculties also had to be suspended for a procession of try-hard comedians, pub singers, sob stories, village fete dancers and that Haunting thing which had Amanda Holden gasping, panting, yelping “F***” and Simon claiming: “It sounded like being next door to you on honeymoon.”Though probably not the fortnight inside Les Dennis’s static caravan in Rhyl.It wasn’t all bad, naturally.Someone almost held a tune, I’m sure, and there was a bit more tension to Jonathan Goodwin’s “Blindfold chick- en with crossbow”than there was about the Gomonov bird, who kept ducking out of the way almost every time her mate threw a kne.But what BGT really needs in such circumstances are dingbats like Gonzo, the fat Japanese tambourine frenzy, and Guy First, the Israeli bloke who can hand-fart the opening verse and chorus of We Will Rock You.He was born to be on this show, in fact, which makes what Alesha Dixon did during his semi-final appearance even more of a sackable offence.

Think rationally, Alesha, luv, and you might as well pack up and go home now, because the nut-fudge fringe acts are one of only two reasons this carnival of the mediocre is still going after  series.The other, of course, is the hosts, Ant  Dec, who may have fluffed the odd line but they never gushed or patronised, let alone talked down to the eventual winner, Colin Thackery.It was a majestic performance that came with a slightly unwelcome sting in the tail, on Sunday night, from Ant.“There’s a very special new show coming up later in the year, Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions.

Now the eye-watering cost to taxpayers can be revealedShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsA stock photo of an elderly woman in a wheelchair \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTory ministers are quietly handing private firms an extra £million to test sick and disabled people for benefits - despite an avalanche of complaints. Welfare chiefs are accused of rewarding failure after they extended contracts with corporate giants Atos and Maximus without going out to tender. The firmsapos deals to assess people for Personal Independence Paymentsand Employment and Support Allowancewere each extended in recent months to July . Now the eye-watering cost has been confirmed by the Department for Work and Pensions, which slipped the details online without fanfare late last Friday. The documents said extending Atosapos PIP contract by two years would cost taxpayers up to £.m, while the ESA contract - run by a subsidiary of Maximus - would cost up to £.m for a -month extension. In total, DWP chiefs have approved up to £.m on the two contracts put together.  It was the second time each firm had its contract extended by the DWP despite an outcry over the failing privately-run tests. Last June Atos was warned to start delivering or  by MPs on the powerful Work and Pensions Committee. And % of ESA tests and % of PIP tests that went to appeal in the last three months of  were overturned, the highest rate on record. Yet the corporate giants will now have enjoyed their lucrative contracts for eight and seven years respectively by the time they finally come up for renewal. The DWP said the contracts were extended to ensure stability while it redesigns the assessment process to make it better for claimants long term. When she announced the move in March, DWP chief Amber Rudd argued it would pave the way for a more joined-up claimant experience in future. But Genevieve Edwards, of the MS Society, branded the extensions a kick in the teeth for people claiming PIP for the painful and exhausting condition.  She said: Weaposve been told all too frequently that assessors donapost understand MS and the process doesnapost capture the reality of living with it. Itaposs nonsensical to reward this lack of understanding and failing system with extra millions of pounds, when what is really needed is an overhaul so people donapost have to fight to get the support they need. Atos delivers the majority of PIP assessments under the name Independent Assessment Servicesthrough a contract it has held since . ESA assessments have been delivered since October  by a firm called The Centre for Health and Disability Assessments Ltd- whose parent corporation is US outsourcing giant Maximus.  Capita also has a PIP assessments contract, which is also being extended, but talks are ongoing over the details. Labouraposs Shadow Minister for Disabled People Marsha De Cordova said: It is scandalous that hundreds of millions of pounds more have been handed over to private companies, such as Atos and CHDA, that are wreaking havoc on disabled people’s lives. By extending these contracts, this Tory government has once again shown its disregard for the appalling inaccuracies of outsourced assessments for PIP and ESA, which have had a devastating impact on so many disabled people. Labour will end the hostile environment that these assessments have created and bring them in house. The data was uploaded last Friday to the DWPaposs website but then removed on Monday - following the Mirroraposs enquiries - with officials claiming parts were inaccurate. Despite the removal a DWP spokeswoman told the Mirror today that the data was in fact accurate. Itaposs understood the price tag is a maximum budget and could end up being less. A DWP spokeswoman confirmed: “These figures refer to the previously announced extensions of the PIP and HDAS contracts to , and not to any additional extensions or new costs.  We’re committed to providing the best possible service for disabled people, which is why we’re continually improving the assessment process for PIP and ESA. We regularly monitor our assessment providers to ensure they are delivering against the high standards we expect.” A spokesman for CHDA, whose parent firm is Maximus, said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with DWP to deliver the Health Assessment Advisory Service. Since taking over the service we have fundamentally improved the experience for those we assess.  The time spent in the assessment process has more than halved, we have doubled the number of clinical staff working in the service and consistently met the majority of our performance targets. We will continue to work in partnership with charities and disabled people’s organisations to improve the service further.” A spokesman for Atosapos IAS said: “We are absolutely committed to providing a professional and compassionate service for every claimant. And as we continue to work with the DWP and listen to all feedback with a clear focus on achieving this, we shall also make continuous improvements.” "},{"url":null,"title":"peterborough election live race between","story":"NewsPeterborough by-election LIVE: Race between Labour and Nigel Farages Brexit Party too close to callThe newly founded party could win their first MP from the ultra-tight marginal seatShareByOliver MilnePolitical CorrespondentUpdated:,  JUN NewsNigel Farages party could win their first MP - but were managing expectations \" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news politics peterborough-election-live-race-between- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party are hoping to deliver a second political earthquake just weeks after being founded and topping the polls in EU parliament elections by electing their first MP.

Nominations open and close on Monday to be Britainaposs next Prime Minister - and already the insults are flying. Splits have emerged over everything from Brexit to schools and Labour anti-Semitism. The  candidates are jostling for the backing of their fellow Tory MPs, whoaposll narrow the field down to just two by the end of June. Thataposs sparked a desperate search for support - since MPs without  backers will be automatically eliminated next Thursday. Theyaposll then go to a ballot of , Tory members whoaposll install the UKaposs next leader by July . Here are  of the most dramatic spats just in the last  hours. If we did them all weaposd be here all day...    Michael Gove launched a barely-veiled attack on arch-rival Boris Johnson, who he kned out of the last leadership race three years ago. In a barb at the gaffe-prone Brexiteer, Mr Gove said MPs need someone who is serious about the job at hand. And he took aim at Mr Johnsonaposs claim that Theresa Mayaposs Brexit deal would make the UK a vassal state. The Environment Secretary said: I think it demeans language to use words like vassal state. People use words like vassal state and treachery, traitor. You are not a traitoryou disagree with me about Europe. He also said Boris Johnsonaposs refusal to delay Brexit beyond October  could force a general election that thrusts Jeremy Corbyn into  Downing Street.    Dominic Raab sparked fury with an illegal plot to ram through No Deal Brexit - by SHUTTING the House of Commons. A huge row erupted after Dominic Raab refused to rule out proroguing Parliament to prevent MPs voting against No Deal on October . Mr Raab, a hard Brexiteer, said he would be prepared to take the drastic move at a behind-closed-doors hustings last night. But pro-EU Cabinet minister Amber Rudd - whoaposs not standing but is considered a aposkingmakerapos for moderate MPs - raged: Itaposs outrageous to consider proroguing Parliament. We are not Stuart kings. And pro-EU leadership rival Rory Stewart said the move would be illegal adding: It would be unconstitutional. It would be undemocratic. And it wouldnapost work.  MPs like Michael Gove have been saying theyaposd be prepared to delay Brexit to get a deal through. And several seem to think they can do better than Theresa May at getting a deal - among them Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock. But anti-Brexit rival Sam Gyimah, the only candidate to back a second referendum, hit back. He branded those who thought they were better than Mrs May chest-beating men driven by Trumpian machismo. He told Bloomberg: You’ve got chest-beating men saying they could do what Theresa May failed to do. “They’re saying they could go and renegotiate in a Trump way and get a better deal.”    Dominic Raab came eye-to-eye with Chancellor Philip Hammond in a private hustings last night. A source in the room said the arch-Brexiteer turned to the pro-EU rival and attacked his strategy from just a few feet away. According to the source he was asked what the worst mistake of the previous government was. He turned, cold-eyed, to pro-EU Chancellor Philip Hammond at last nightaposs event and said Brits were sick of Brexit aposProject Fearapos.  Brexiteer outrider Esther McVey attacked Michael Gove - who as Education Secretary went to war with teachers - by saying the Tories must listen to school staff. And she blamed that failure to listen for the Tories losing votes. She wrote in The Times: It’s time we started listening to the teaching unions and teachers on the frontline. The Conservative Party has lost the votes of many teachers in recent years, largely because they believed we weren’t listening to them. This must change. If we, as a party, are not prepared to listen to what teachers and their unions are telling us about where the shortfalls are and what our priorities should be, we can’t properly claim to be a party that takes our children’s education seriously. She also vowed yesterday to sack any Remainers in the Cabinet in a purge to ensure Brexit happens on time.  This one isnapost a blue-on-blue attack, but itaposs so shocking we deemed it worthy of inclusion. Tory leadership candidate Matt Hancock was branded “a desparate no-hoper” last night after accusing Jeremy Corbyn of anti-semitism. In a controversial pitch to win over Tory MPs, the health secretary launched a savage personal attack on the Labour leader. He told a Westminster hustings that unless the Tories sorted themselves out on Brexit they would lose to Labour at the next election. In remarks clearly intended to raise his profile among party members, he added: “The Conservative party has got to get this right. “If we don’t, we could end up with the first anti-semitic leader of a Western nation since the Second World War.” Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a close Corbyn ally, said the Tory minister’s remarks were “a disgrace” as he walked past moments later. Labour chairman Ian Lavery told the Mirror: “It’s desperate remarks from a desperate no-hoper who will say anything to try and achieve power. Hancock should concentrate his efforts on the Tories potential sell off of our cherished NHS to Trump and his cronies.” A Labour source added: “This baseless political attack rings hollow from a minister in a party that has supported governments that actively promote antisemitic policies in Hungary and Poland, and has spent the week wooing Trump”.

Party chiefs are mulling the extreme measure to stop Tory MPs taking photos of the ballot paper to choose the next PM - which itaposs feared could be hijacked and copied. Even veteran MPs and Cabinet ministers will have to show security-cleared ID before they vote - and the colour of ballot papers will only be decided the night before. The rules were unveiled today by the  Committee of Tory MPs, which is running the first part of the election. MPs will vote up to five or six times to whittle the -strong field of candidates down to two by June . The two final candidates then go to a vote by , Conservative Party members by the end of July. Read the full leadership election timetable here. MPs will vote and the results will be announced in the dark, oak-led Committee Room  in the Victorian Palace of Westminster.    MPs will have to enter through one door at the end of the room, show their parliamentary security passes at the door in order to very they really are a Tory MP. They will then be ticked off a list and handed a ballot paper, which has to be imprinted with a special  Committee stamp to show it is genuine. At that point they will proceed into Committee Room  to vote in a private booth, like in a general election. They must then leave via a separate door in the middle of the committee room. MPs who are away on business can get a proxy vote. But the MP voting on their behalf must be nominated in advance, and run through the entire voting process twice. Ballot boxes will then be taken into a completely off-limits room for votes to be counted,  Committee acting co-chair Dame Cheryl Gillan said.  Dame Cheryl said MPs will absolutely not be allowed to communicate photos of their ballot papers. I monitor international elections, she said. I did Turkey, Iaposve done Bosnia and Herzegovina. There was no photographing of the ballots. Weaposre going to try to prevent it this time, there were MPs that did it last time. They may need to leave their pass and their phone whilst they go and vote. We havenapost decided on that. It is not reasonable to expect the ballot papers to be photographed. If MPs do tweet photos of their ballot papers, Dame Cheryl said, they will incur the wrath of the  executive.    Thoughthey turn up only just before the cut-off time and there is a queue, apos chiefs will be flexible about letting them in to vote. Askedshe didnapost trust Tory MPs, Dame Cheryl said: We do trust our colleagues. But we also have to have a process in which people have confidence. Therefore, as we are in charge of it, we have to go to those s to make sure thereaposs a process everybody in the party does have confidence in. Lined with historic artworks, Parliamentaposs Committee Room  is the same hall where Theresa May survived a no-confidence vote by her own MPs in December. Now it will be used to host the contest for her successor. Results of the first secret ballot on Thursday  June will be announced in alphabetical order at pm. Those with  or fewer votes are knocked out.  Anyone with  or fewer votes is then knocked out in the second ballot on Tuesday  June. Further ballots on June - will then knock out one MP each time until just two remain. Acting co-chair of the committee Charles Walker said: We are aiming to have two people by Thursday June . There is provision for a fth ballot on Thursday June . Iaposm not a mathematical or statistical expert, but I think it would be very dficult... to get beyond a fth ballot in this process. Who knows  We might finish this process before Thursday June . If two candidates in the MPsapos ballot are tied for last place, there will be a discussion with both candidates and the ballot could have to be re-run.  Mr Walker said: Weaposre not going to be drawing lots. I think thataposs a bit extreme. The rules were subject to a last-minute shake-up to add the -MP and -MP thresholds - a move intended to speed up the race when more than a dozen MPs stood.  Committee chiefs defended the last-minute change, insisting the rules had never been set in stone - and are changed before every leadership election. They said the Committee had guidelines on how to set its rules - but refused today to release those guidelines to the public. Mr Walker said because Theresa May only resigns tomorrow, the rules have not officially been changed midway through a leadership contest. He said: The feedback Iaposve had from constituents is aposthank God the  has got a grip of this and is delivering a process in a timely fashionapos. Dame Cheryl added: The President of my association actually contacted me to say how many phone calls sheaposd had, of people saying they were very pleased weaposd agreed the rules. Committee Room  will also host two behind-closed-doors hustings on June - and June . Only Tory MPs will be allowed into the hustings with not even Conservative peers - or the press - allowed in. The Toriesapos DUP allies will not be allowed in either.  Despite open warfare gripping the Tories for months - and every meeting instantly leaking -  acting chair Charles Walker claimed journalists would make MPs terried of speaking their mind. He told reporters bluntly: The fact of the matter is, you do cramp colleaguesapos styles on occasion. We want to have hustings where people can ask questions and express themselves fully. And to be honest, with you sitting in the back of the room Iaposd be pretty terried, and Iaposve been here for a number of years. You are quite a frightening group of people on occasions, and I mean that. Dame Cheryl claimed the room was too small to fit even one pool journalist inside during hustings. She said: Press doesnapost have access to all areas. There are still some things that do remain in private. There are going to be plenty of opportunities for hustings, for you to see the candidates in hustings.  Once two final candidates have been chosen the Toriesapos , members will spend a month deciding who will lead their party. Members will take part in a postal ballot, with a nationwide tour and a huge list of hustings by the candidates expected. There is no electronic voting. Hustings are expected to be held in every single region of the UK and are expected to be open to the press. Nominations open at am and close at pm this coming Monday. MPs must submit their names with a proposer, seconder and six more MP backers to the  Committee. The race is overseen by  Committee acting co-chairs Dame Cheryl Gillan and Charles Walker after chairman Sir Graham Brady quit to mull a leadership bid himself. Neither the five officers of the  Committee nor Tory chairman Brandon Lewis can campaign for a candidate. But they do all get a vote and members of the wider  executive are free to campaign.  Theresa May will remain a lame duck Prime Minister until the end of July after she resigns as leader, through an exchange of letters with the Committee, tomorrow.  She will also continue to be the partyaposs acting leader to avoid an interim leader having to be formally registered with the Electoral Commission. And she will only stop being Prime Minister after going to Buckingham Palace to tell the Queen she is leaving. Downing Street today said she would only leave when she believes someone  can command the confidence of the House. That sparked speculation she could wait until Parliamentaposs summer break, to stop Labour triggering an immediate no-confidence vote in the government. No later claried there was no question of the prime minister hanging around beyond the Conservative leadership contest. But  Committee chiefs today were unable to guarantee the winner of the Tory leadership race will definitely become the next Prime Minister. Dame Cheryl said: Weaposre the ing officers for the election. We produce the result. We donapost deal with what happens in the aftermath. Mr Walker added: I donapost think anybody can say anything with certainty.

I will be writing to her directly to find out the details of the cases she outlined in the House of Commons. Last month it was claimed ministers have failed to learn the lessons of Grenfell after research showed some fire brigades are so stretched they can only send two fire engines to tackle a high-rise blaze. The Fire Brigades Unionbranded it a “postcode lottery” and accused Fire Minister Nick Hurd of “utter complacency.”    Some  fire engines were mobilised to tackle the West London blaze in June   An FBU survey found two brigades - Durham and North Yorkshire - had just an allocation of just two pumps for a high rise fire. The highest number was seven, but most had allocated just four. At least  residential buildings across the country are wrapped in the same aluminium based flammable cladding which allowed the Grenfell Tower fire to spread so quickly. A government spokesperson said: “Fire and rescue services have the resources they need and we are encouraged that the number of fire safety audits carried out on purpose-built flats of four or more storeys more than doubled, to nearly , in -, compared with the previous year. “We have banned combustible cladding and are fully funding its replacement on high-rise residential buildings in the private and social housing sectors.

The -year-old South Wales ­factory’s closure in September next year was branded a new “hammer blow” to Britain’s motor industry. Staff were informed in letters from the US firm – then sent home and told not to come back till Monday. Employee Tony Phillips said: “I’m losing my job after  years. We’ve been lied to by Ford, which said its UK plants weren’t going to close.” Colleague Mark Lendrum told of his “devastation”, adding: “South Wales will be like a ghost town.” Another, Tom Jones, said: “My dad and half my street work at Ford.  This is gutting.” Locals in other trades also told of their fear for Bridgend’s future. Barber Michael Hanlon said: “The plant’s closure will destroy our town.” The Unite union’s general secretary Len McCluskey called the decision “a grotesque act of economic betrayal”. He went on: “These workers and the community kept faithful to Ford through thick and thin.“ButFord think we’ll make it easy for themto walk away they can forget it. We’ll resist this move with all our might.”The closure will also hit workers in the industry’s supply chain, plus the UK economy.

It blamed factors including “changing customer dem-and” and a fall in petrol engine sales.Its European president Stuart Rowley said enhanced pay-offs would be offered to Bridgend workers – who were “great” and had “done nothing wrong”.

The seemingly trivial injury caused Gill Haddingtonaposs right foot to swell to twice its size, develop sore ulcers and turn in to the left, with her toes curling underneath. The pain in her foot was so intense she would go to AE screaming in agony. After two years she begged doctors to amputate her leg. Now she is finally pain free after having her right leg removed below the knee.    Gill was getting ready one morning in September  when she knocked the empty square-shaped bottle off a chest of drawers in her bedroom by accident. She said: When I first did it I cried out in pain, I lted my foot to look at it and it hurt so much I couldnapost put it back down again. Initially I thought I must have broken it - I wish I had. The -year-old, from Morecambe, Lancashire, was sent home from the hospital after X-rays and scans showed no break or injury. However, over time the injury got worse and her own GP advised that the pain condition Fibromyalgia she suffered from must be intensying the sensation.    When her foot swelled and developed ulcers - side effects of auto-immune illness coeliac disease - Gill really started to worry. All the while I was becoming a prisoner in my own home, said Gill. I was in constant excruciating pain. I could not walk at all. Gill had to rely on family, including daughters Natalie, , and Chloe, , to feed her and take her out for walks. I donapost think I slept at all at that time, she added. It hurt too much to be laid up in bed.    Instead I would sleep on the sofa with my foot propped on a box to keep it in position, any movement I made in the night would wake me. Sometimes the pain was so acute Gillaposs partner, construction salesman Pete Nisbet, , would take her to the hospital for help. She was finally diagnosed with chronic regional pain syndrome in May  - a condition with which a person experiences persistent severe and debilitating pain followed by an injury.    Gill said: I had already started talking about wanting my leg removed, but everyone couldnapost believe what I was saying. My leg was already dead to me, it was the cause of so much pain and unhappiness and I just wanted to get on with my le. I wanted to be able to walk again and to go swimming. I love open-air swimming. Gill was eventually referred to a specialist in February  who she begged to remove her leg. She said: The specialist didnapost want to do it at first, but he saw how much pain I was in and he relented. In a way, I am pleased the pain was so bad. He could see there was no turning back from what was happening to me. This was the only way out.    Within four months Gill was in surgery. Surgeons at Royal Preston Hospital removed her leg in May  from under her knee, to ensure that she was left pain free. Gill continued: As soon as I came round my partner said to me, aposI can see Iaposve got my Gill backapos. I felt so happy. After months of being a wheelchair undergoing physio and aftercare, Gill got her first prosthetic leg in September  and was beside herself with joy. As soon as I got it I said to Pete, aposletaposs go for a walkapos, and we walked along the promenade. It was wonderful to be up and about. I hadnapost walked for almost three years. The prosthetic isnapost perfect but I love it so much, having my leg removed was the best thing I ever did. I donapost regret it at all.    Eventually Gill felt well enough toto her swimming. She will swam one mile in the John West Great North Swim, at Brockhole-on-Windermere, in the Lake District, on Saturdayfor charity. She said: I love swimming, I feel free when I swim, nothing hurts.

I was sitting up in my pram, oblivious of the great drama. But this was a genuine people’s war. Every family had a personal stake in the long, exhausting battle to defeat Nazi tyranny. My father was in the RAF in the Middle East, my uncle Bob was flying tailgunner in Lancasters, my guardsman uncle Jack was invalided out after Dunkirk. Even my teenage auntie Barbara was in the services. The British people shed blood to liberate Europe. We went to them in their hour of need. They should now repay that sacrice, by coming to us in our hour of need, enabling us to withdraw from the EU with dignity, friendship and close trading links.  Arrogant President Macron and mighty Chancellor Merkel owe the freedom their nations enjoy today to the Tommies who gave their tomorrows. They should remember that and act accordingly. More than a million American servicemen joined the invasion of France, many giving their lives far from home for a free Europe. Their sacrice is rightly remembered alongside our own.

The teenager was advised to have a full hysterectomy by doctors after the condition left her bed bound and suffering from painful cramps. Samara, a part-time receptionist, was desperate to become a mum and after receiving the £, funds from her family she was able to seek help from a fertility clinic.    And after just one round of IVF, she was over the moon when her two-week scan revealed she was pregnant with her daughter Ailani, now seven-months-old. The stay-at-home mum, Portsmouth, Hampshire, said: I suffered with cramps since I was -years-old and it got progressively worse to the point I couldnapost get out of bed. When I was , I collapsed and was rushed into hospital which is when they discovered I have a cyst the size of an orange, but the pains continued even after it was removed.    The following year, I was bed bound from February until June []. I lost a lot of friends as they didnapost understand why I couldnapost hang out with them, I couldnapost even make it to the local shops. I managed to sit my GCSEs with special arrangements at school but was unable to continue in higher education as my condition worsened. I was told at -years-old that I will need a hysterectomyI want to improve my quality of le and it really hit me. Samara, who was diagnosed with endometriosis in , I have always been maternal since a kid when I used to play with dolls, I knew I wanted to be a mum so finding out I might not be able to have children was heart-breaking.    Although the doctors didnapost give me a timescale, I knew a hysterectomy was vital because even after two surgeries, the pain was still there and it was unbearable. I didnapost want to jump into a relationship then have a baby with someone I had just met, so IVF and a sperm donor was my only option. It was a strange process picking the father of my baby from a list of hair and eye colour, but I just matched the characterises to mine. I always knew I would have a baby one day but I thought perhaps I would have a boyfriend too, but I wouldnapost change it for the world, I couldnapost image my le without Ailani now.  Samara felt the best she had in years whilst pregnant as pregnancy is known to reduce the pain and, in some cases, shrink endometriosis. Since giving birth, Samara, who turned  in January last year, is now able to work part-time as the severe cramps have not ed. She adds: It was never an option for me to have a hysterectomy without a baby and my parents were completely behind me. When I was bed bound, I was wondering aposwhy me apos but now I am grateful because I have my daughter. IVF was really harsh on my body, but it was worth it, I loved being pregnant as the cramps and pain completely stopped. I have taken a dferent route to my other friends who went to college after school but I am a mum now and I donapost plan on missing a second of Alana growing up. I went through so much to get her here so I want to enjoy as much time with her as I can before I start working.

Mason Reese, , and Sarah Russi, , say they are used to getting stares when they go out in public. But the couple claim money has nothing to do with their relationship, which is based around common interests, mutual respect and a similar sense of humour. Mason, from New York, said: “Truth of the matter is I don’t see myself as being in her league, so when I look at a beautul young -years-old adult model I don’t think, ‘oh she is gonna be in love with me’. “When she first expressed interest in actually being in a relationship with me I think I was just shocked as anybody.    “A lot of people have come out and been like, ‘really you are with that dude, like why  Is it for the money  Is it because he is your sugar daddy ’”  Although Sarah has previously worked as a sugar baby, she maintains that her arrangement with Mason, who is a former child actor, is strictly personal. She said: “The idea of being a sugar baby is it can be like fun sometimes, like getting paid  for dinners, but ever since I started talking to Mason I just decided that I don’t want that anymore. I feel like I’m happy to be in a relationship with him. “I am really happy with Mason .

The cathedral service was held in Bayeux, the first major place to be liberated after the Allied forces invasion which was the largest amphibious invasion in military history and the beginning of the end of the Second World War. The ,-strong congregation declared in unison: We shall remember them, before a two-minute silence as emotional tributes were held in France and the UK. At the start of the service, Cardinal Marc Ouellet read a message on behalf of Pope Francis, who said D-Day was decisive in the fight against Nazi barbarism and paid tribute to those who joined the Army and gave their lives for freedom and peace. D-Day veteran Kenneth Hay, who was just  when he joined the operation, read from the poem Normandy, by Cyril Crain, who also took part in the Allied invasion. Mr Hayaposs reading began: Come and stand in memory of men who fought and died.  They gave their lives in Normandy, remember them with pride. Mr Crain landed at Juno Beach in June , four days before his st birthday. He died in , aged . Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said after the service: It was a beautul and inclusive service in memory of people who died in Normandy and ultimately helped to defeat the scourge of fascism. He also paid tribute to the people of Bayeux who he described as being so welcoming during events also attended by Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, as well as senior staff from the Army, Navy and Royal Air Force. Following the service, hundreds of people queued in the streets of Bayeux to clap and cheer D-Day veterans as they paraded from the cathedral to the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery.    There, dignitaries and veterans laid commemorative wreaths at the Cross of Sacrice at the site where more than , war dead are buried. Mrs May - who resigns as Conservative leader on Friday - gave a reading from the Book of Micah before the hymn Abide With Me was sung. D-Day veteran Ray Lord then read: They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old. Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun, and in the morning, we will remember them. The Last Post was played by the Band and Bugles of The Rles, followed by a two minutes silence.    D-Day veteran Alan Harris then read: When you go home, tell of us and say, for your tomorrow, we gave our today. Veteran Frank Baugh, , told a service at Bayeux Cemetery how he was a signalman on a landing craft that took  troops from nd Battalion Kingaposs Shropshire Light Infantry from Newhaven to Sword beach. He described how the troops landed in about ft of rough water under heavy machine gun fire at .am. The landing craft was hit and the number  troop space caught fire, leaving some badly injured and having to stay on the ship, but those who had been lightly injured followed their comrades, he said. They wanted to go with their partners and thataposs what happened, Mr Baugh said. My most abiding memory of that day is seeing our boys we had been talking to the minute before. They got cut down with machine gun fire. They would fall into the water, floating face down and we couldnapost get them out.  We couldnapost help them. That is my most abiding memory and I canapost forget it. Prime Minister Theresa May, the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt and First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon are among those attending the service. Earlier in the day, a lone piper played an emotional lament at the exact moment British troops landed on Gold Beach in Normandy on June , . Pipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie, of th Regiment Royal Artillery , performed Highland Laddie as crowds gathered on the beach below him and lined the promenade, applauding his performance. The piper began the lament at .am local timeon the remaining Mulberry Harbour in the town called Port Winston, signalling the minute the invasion began and the moment the first British soldier landed on Gold beach in Nazi-occupied France. Before the cathedral service, Mrs May and French President Emmanuel Macron attended an inauguration ceremony for a memorial to commemorate more than , members of the British armed forces who died in Normandy in summer .The British Normandy Memorial, funded by the Normandy Memorial Trust, is being built on a hillside in Ver-sur-Mer, overlooking Gold Beach, one of the key sites for British troops during the Normandy Landings.  A sculpture created by David Williams-Ellis was unveiled marking the beginning of construction for the memorial depicting three British soldiers storming the beaches. Expected to be completed within a year, it will record the names of , members of the British armed forces who died in the D-Day landings and Battle of Normandy. Mrs May and Mr Macron laid wreaths at the foundation stone of the monument. Seven British D-Day veterans were accompanied by four children, including Sir Winston Churchillaposs great-great grandson John Churchill, to lay flowers in front of the sculpture. Addressing the audience, French President Emmanuel Macron said: I am honoured to stand alongside Theresa May today to launch construction work for the British memorial at Ver-sur-Mer.The British people have long dreamt of this memorial. He added: This is where,  years ago, on June , , almost , British soldiers landed in France to free the country from Nazi control. This is where young men, many of whom had never set foot on French soil, landed at dawn under German fire, risking their lives while fighting their way up the beach, which was littered with obstacles and mines.  He added: It is time to remedy the fact that no memorial pays tribute to the United Kingdomaposs contribution to the Battle of Normandy. He said the monument would also be a symbol of the ties binding France and the UK. He said: Nothing will break them. Nothing can ever break ties that have been bound in bloodshed and shared values. The debates taking place today cannot affect the strength of our joint history and our shared future. President Macron assured Mrs May of his friendship, adding: Leaders may come and go but their achievements remain. The force of our friendship will outlast current events. Speaking at the inauguration service, Mrs May said: Itaposs incredibly moving to be here today, looking out over the beaches where one of the greatest battles for freedom this world has ever known took place. And it is truly humbling to do so with the men who were there that day. Itaposs an honour for all of us to share this moment with you.  She added: Standing here as the waves wash quietly onto the shore below us, it is almost impossible to grasp the raw courage it must have taken that day to leap from the landing craft and into the surf despite the fury of battle... If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world, that day was June , . Paying tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrice, she said: They laid down their lives so that we might have a better le and build a better world. The ceremony concluded with a piped lament from Trooper Kurtis Rankin of The Royal Dragoon Guards, and Mrs May and Mr Macron then spoke to the veterans. Some  plus D-Day veterans gathered in the town of Arromanches for a series of events, including a Red Arrows flypast and a firework display. Members of the public queued up to thank D-Day veterans for their service during the Second World War. Sid Barnes, , from Norfolk, served in the Royal Army Service Corps and landed on beach by Arromanches on June . He s every year to the town and attends commemoration events.  This year visitors were coming up to him to shake his hand, with one man saying: Without you and everything you and the other veterans did, we would not be here. Mr Barnes said: People are coming up to us to say thank you. But I think aposthank you for what apos We just did what we knew we must do. It is nice to know we are valued though. He was enjoying the sunshine on the promenade with other veterans including Charles Burton, , who came over to Normandy as part of a wave of troops on the second day June  with the Royal Ulster Rles. Mr Burton said: Itaposs nice to take part to be here but itaposs very dficult as you remember the others who died. In the UK, a service of remembrance and wreath laying took place at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire, with dignitaries including the Duke of Cambridge, who joined more than  D-Day veterans at a public service in Heroesapos Square. As a -year-old, Pixie Jenkins, a former Wren, helped drive troops and equipment to Newhaven Docks in East Sussex in the the build-up to D-Day and throughout the Normandy Landings. The -year-old, from Aldridge, near Walsall, West Midlands, was among a handful of veterans who travelled to wreath-laying ceremony. Reflecting on the anniversary, said: I think the men that went over were wonderful and I hope the younger people today realise how fortunate they are to have people like that.  I think so many youngsters today have forgotten about the men. They look at them and think apostheyaposre old men nowapos - to them theyaposre just old men. And theyaposre not, they are wonderful, wonderful men that went over. I salute them all. Prince William laid a wreath with a personal message reading: In memory of all those who have made the ultimate sacrice. We will remember them. William. In Portsmouth - a day after a national service attended by the Queen, Mrs May, US President Donald Trump and other world leaders - a veterans parade was held before a memorial service at the cityaposs D-Day Stone. Veteran Jimmy Ockendon, , wiped away tears during the service attended by thousands of members of the public who paid their respects during a minuteaposs silence. Mr Ockendon told the Press Association: It was very emotional, the main person I was thinking of was my uncle who went on the Hood, his we had died just beforehand and he left two young children and my father and mother adopted them. I was also thinking of my father. As well as wearing his own service medals, Mr Ockendon, from Portsmouth, donned those of his father, Sergeant James Ockendon, who was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre and the Victoria Cross for his role in the First World War.  Mr Ockendon, who was serving at the time of D-Day but not directly involved in the operation, said: We were just off France and I heard on the Tannoy what was happening. We didnapost worry much in those days, we just got on with the job. Mr Ockendon, who attended with his we Joyce, , attended the service after earlier this week naming a train The D-Day Story Portsmouth for South Western Railway in recognition of the th anniversary. In south-west London, Prince Harry attended Founderaposs Day at the Royal Hospital Cha where he met the Cha Pensioners and six veterans from the Normandy Landings. President Donald Trump and his we Melania met American veterans at Omaha Beach in Colleville-sur-Mer, where they were joined by Mr Macron. Mr Trump, who flew in from Ireland, told veterans: Our debt to you is everlasting. Today we express our undying gratitude. When you were young - these men enlisted their lives in a great crusade - one of the greatest of all times. Their mission is the story of an epic battle and the ferocious eternal struggle between good and evil.In one of the first events of the day, serving soldiers paid tribute to the heroic efforts of their Second World War brothers in arms at a ceremony marking the first key battle of D-Day.  Shortly after midnight on June , , soldiers landed next to bridges over the river and canal at Benouville. Capturing the two bridges, codenamed Ham and Jam, was a key part of the D-Day operation, as it hampered movement of enemy troops and enable the Allied forces to press forward from the beaches. Dropping on French soil minutes into D-Day, parachutists and gliders from the Oxford and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and the Glider Pilot Regiment joined the Royal Engineers, who were towed across the Channel in -men Horsa gliders, pulled by bombers, before gliding to their small landing area with pinpoint accuracy from , feet. The bridges were captured after a battle lasting under  minutes in which two soldiers were killed and  wounded, including Herbert Denham aposDenapos Brotheridge, who led the troops across and was the first British soldier killed in action in the Normandy campaign. When mission commander Major John Howard transmitted the Ham and Jam code to signal their success it marked the first British objective to be achieved on D-Day. Three-quarters of a century on,  soldiers from their successor units The Rles and the Army Air Corps gathered at the bridge. The Rles held a ceremony at the Pegasus Bridge memorial to mark the moment the gliders landed, with a speech from Major Howardaposs daughter Penny. French politician Christophe Blanchet told the crowd: This bridge was to allow the liberation of France, and with it the rest of Europe. A recording of Major Howardaposs speech from a ceremony at the site  years ago was played before the Band and Bugles of The Rles led their troops across the bridge.  Rleman Peter Ramsden, of the Rles nd Battalion, spoke of his pride in following in the footsteps of D-Day heroes. The -year-old from Durham, and currently stationed in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, said: Itaposs a massive honour to march across Pegasus Bridge. As one of our regimentaposs most prestigious battle honours, it means a lot not only to the regiment but to the lads in the regiment as well. The officers and soldiers joined Arlette Gondree at for a Champagne toast at the cafe she owns next to the bridge, Cafe Gondree, in a tradition held since D-Day. The cafe, where she lived with her family, was the first home in France to be liberated by the British and Ms Gondreeaposs father dug up champagne he had hidden in the garden from the Nazi occupiers, to toast the British troops who freed them. Ms Gondree said: There were  Germans in the village, fortunately they never found daddyaposs hoard. But when the British soldiers dug out their trenches, my father asked them to dig it up. Thus the reason why the tradition of the Champagne is tied to the Gondree name, to this simple house, and this is what I do tonight to thank them all and to remember what they went through. The great grandson of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, Randolph Churchill, paid tribute to those who took part in the D-Day landings. Itaposs remarkable to think that  years ago the heroes that gave us our freedom were coming up these shores, he told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain. With the veterans here today - and itaposs wonderful to see so many - itaposs wonderful we can honour them and their comrades that didnapost come back. They really did give their today so we can have a better tomorrow.

The suspension of North Koreaaposs games was confirmed by tourism agencies with access to the East Asian country.    Koryo Tours, a Beijing travel agency that takes foreign tourists to see the show, tweeted that the mass games was temporarily suspended. From June  there will be a pause for some days weeks while the show is adjusted before being launched again - we wait to see what will change and when it will restart - watch this space!The Sydney Morning Herald reports the regime charges as much as USper person for foreign tourists to attend. The newspaper approached the general manager of Koryo Tours who reportedly said he had no idea what features of the show had upset Kim, with another employee adding the display was similar to the previous yearaposs rendition. The manager also said no one in North Korea could confirm Kim had ordered the suspension as they were not allowed to speak on his behalf. However Young Pioneer Tours tweeted that the games had been temporarily halted due to Kimaposs dissatisfaction with the ongoing performance.    Rare opportunities for outsiders to visit inside the state are heavily chaperoned, and curious visitors are widely cautioned against touring there. North Korea is viewed as a serious nuclear threat in the ided peninsula, where Kimaposs regime is internationally criticised as a surveillance state and frequently accused of human rights abuses by other countries and watchdogs including Amnesty International. Watchdogs say children are put through months of gruelling train ahead of Pyong Yangaposs annual May Day shows.When the Mirror spent eight days inside secretive North Korea last year , the Pyongyang parade involved , military and civilians and , performers, many of them children.Kim was seen waving enthusiastically to the crowd during the spectacular.   American college student Otto Warmbier was imprisoned in the country in  after being accused of trying to steal a propaganda poster from a hotel.He was released back to the US the following year in a vegetative state and died a short time later.

I have spoken to Shinnie.“Aberdeen has been brilliant for him, but it was time for him to come down and test himself against good players in a strong league.“I think he will stand up to that, no problem at all. I know what kind of guy he is.

That is because we know how good the squad is.“The performance wasn’t up to scratch and the fans have got their own view on that. They are entitled to their opinion.“We know we weren’t good enough that day, but we got the win. Right now, we just need to look forward.“We can’t dwell on what has happened in the last couple of games. We have got new management, we will get a lt from that right away.“We need to look forward. We have got two tough games coming up. That is where the focus is.McLean hopes the Scots can build on the optimism around the national team in this double header after the appointment of Clarke. Replacing Alex McLeish with the former Kilmarnock gaffer was universally welcomed and McLean hopes they can continue the feelgood factor with their displays on the pitch.The former St Mirren player said: “That is the big thing. When you get Scotland fans onside it is like having a th man. I know it’s a bit of a cliche, but it’s true.“We just hope the fans get right behind us in these two games. We know that they will.“As I say, we have some really exciting players here. They are players they will want to come and watch in the next few years.“We have got two important games coming up that we know we can do really well in and push ourselves to the championships.“We’ve been training and had a team meeting and he will put his stamp on what he wants to do with the team but I think everybody knows what’s expected.“We want to do as well as we can going into every game inidually.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

development projects in the area.At the end of July, the group set off to host a development camp for young Malawian males to build confidence and leadership skills.Activities will include construction work to restore an elderly womanrsquos home damaged by recent floods.And the group will also take time to hike up Mount Mulanje to reach the highest peak in Malawi.After planning the expedition last summer, the group has need to raise over pound each for the project.Denis Robson, Graham Little, Thea Panter, John Little and Sophie Wilson will team up with five Malawian leaders to host the pilot programme.Through the Rotary Young Leadersprogramme, the Scottish Borders group was able to link up with the Rotary Club of Limbe, to plan the project.Travelling to Zomba, in Malawi, the objective is to develop leadership skills for both the --year olds taking part and the young Borderers involved.Innerleithens Denis Robson, the group leader, has been involved in making connections with the Zomba district for many years.Denis told us: ldquoOur focus is on creating a sustainable model for educating people to become young leaders.ldquoRYLA is a worldwide programme offered by the Rotary to improve the leadership skills of young men and women.ldquoWe are delighted to be taking part in the pilot RYLA Malawi programme and hope to encourage the local rotary clubs to adopt the model in future years and make it sustainable.ldquoWe have an amazing set of Border Exploration Group leaders and graduates who will be able to help share their skills and confidence to the Malawian youths.ldquoAnd I hope they develop a great international understanding that they can have throughout their lives.As part of the development project, the group will work with local skilled people to rebuild a storm damaged home in Liwonde.Malawi often is hit by extreme weather conditions and the recent Cyclone Idai was no exception.Additionally, the programme will include a Climate Mitigation project on the Zomba plateau.Working alongside the Forestry Department the team will prepare a site to plant  trees in October.And educate the community living in the forest to preserve the highly valued resource.It is hoped that these daily activities, together with evening workshops, will develop skills in teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, critical thinking, communication and leadership.A self- assessment questionnaire will be completed before and after the event covering self-confidence, communication skills, practical and leadership ability and general happiness.A presentation to parents s will be given by the young Malawians on the final day explaining what benefit the camp has had for them and how they can apply the experience for the benefit of the community.President-Elect Bernard at the Rotary Club of Limbe:ldquoThe RYLA-Malawi Program will offer an opportunity for Malawian youth to nurture and grow their leadership skills and potential, through boot camp interaction with their Scottish counterparts.Although the team from Scotland will pay their own travel costs, they are still fundraising to meet the expenses of running the RYLA development camp.Sponsorship is needed to cover the cost of all food, accommodation, transport and building materials for the construction projects.For one Malawian youth to attend the camp it costs pound, and the volunteering group hopes to seek sponsors for all .Denis added: ldquoWe are seeking sponsors for the  Malawian youths at pound each.ldquoAnd I would like to thank the Rotary clubs of

Galashiels ndash who was a Captain and i c of A Company, st Battalion Kingrsquos Own Scottish Borderers, in the second assault wave on the morning of June .By June , , the Battalion had moved into the marshalling area Camp A. By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood. At . the Battalion was ordered to pass through the RUR who had reached their objectives but were pinned down by heavy machine Gun, and Mortar Fire. The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded. The end of the month saw the Battalion back in Cambes Wood once more, when we took over the right half of the line from the nd Lincs.During the month of June the Battalion sustained the following casualties two officers and  other ranks killed, eight officers and  other ranks wounded, and four other ranks missing.The Battalion remained in Cambes Wood till July . We continued to probe the enemy defences at night by patrolling. Sgt Grant carried out a very successful  hour patrol in the area of Galmanche. A lot of very valuable information was gained from this patrol. On the evening of July , Lt Robertson lsquoBrsquo Company carried out a very successful patrol and succeeded in bringing back identication of  SS Div ndash this information had been urgently required by higher command in view of the forthcoming attack.The Battalion were relieved by a Battalion of South Staffs and moved by march route to the area of Benouville in preparation for the attack on Caen. On the evening of July  the Battalion took over the nd Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in the area of Le Homme. A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades. Football games were organised and there was a generous allotment for film shows, swimming, etc. The Pipe Band played Retreat for the first time since landing, on the evening of the th. Officers and Other Rank reinforcements joined the Battalion and on the th we moved off at full strength to the area of Ranville, east of the Orne river, in preparation for operation lsquoGoodwoodrsquo, our objective in this operation was the important road centre of Troarn.On the morning of July , the Battalion moved off via Herouvillette, Touffreville to Sannerville. This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy. Enemy shells and mortaring was heavy and we experienced for the first time the enemyrsquos multi-barrelled mortarndash several casualties were suffered by the Battalion, including the CO, Lt. Col G.D. Renny. He was wounded in the face and arm but refused to be evacuated.On passing through the RUR at Sannerville lsquoDrsquo and lsquoBrsquo Coys pushed forward and encountered enemy machine guns. The enemy shelling continued throughout the whole advance. After lsquoBrsquo Coy had successfully put in an attack, the Battalion occupied an orchard about  yards west of Troarn where consolidation was carried out. During the night enemy shelling continued and enemy patrols encountered. On the th, the Battalion attack towards Troarn was continued, lsquoCrsquo Coy left ndash lsquoArsquo Coy right. Both Coys advanced, but were met with heavy machine gun fire, and although supported by tanks, were forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.The Battalion took up its former positions and spent a most unpleasant day of enemy mortar and shell fire.The C.O. was ordered to be evacuated by the Brigadier and Major T.G. Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job. As in Cambes Wood some very good patrolling was done, and several prisoners were taken mostly from  Fusilier Battalion and  Panzer Grenadiers.On July , Lt. Col. J.F.M. MacDonald took over command of the Battalion. A strong enemy patrol attempted to penetrate lsquoBrsquo Coy position but were beaten off by small arms and two-inch mortar fire. Several casualties were inflicted on the enemy in this short and sharp engagement.The Battalion remained in this area till July  when they were relieved to go back into Army Reserve.The total casualties for the month of July were five Officers and  other ranks killed,  officers and  other ranks wounded and one other rank missing.The Old Gala Club records show that the KOSB story of World War II did not end there, continuing from Caen to the far pagodas of Burma.In the words of an old soldier ldquowe didnae dae sae badly."},{"url":null,"title":"50-jobs-saved-as-wetherspoons-takes-borders-pubs-off-the-market","story":"MORE than  jobs have been saved after Wetherspoons decided to take two of its Borders pubs off the market.Earlier this year, the chain announced it was planning to sell the Cross Keys in Peebles and The Bourtree in Hawick.But this week the pub giant announced it had done a U-turn.At total of  members of staff are employed in Peebles, while  work at the Hawick bar.A spokesperson for Wetherspoon said: \"We are pleased to confirm that our pubs at Peebles and Hawick have been taken off the market.\"This follows discussions at head office.\"We know that our staff and customers will be very pleased with the decision.\"We look forward to future success at both pubs for many years to come.\""},{"url":null,"title":"work-to-begin-next-month-on-greenyards-3g-pitch","story":"MELROSE will have a new million pounds G pitch later this year.Scottish Borders Council has given the Greenyards plans, which includes new floodlights, the go-ahead.And work is expected to start as early as next month with a completion date being pencilled in for November.Council Convener David Parker, who has been heavily involved in negotiations to secure the new G pitch at Melrose, told the Border : ldquoI am delighted that we have been able to reach a point where we can invest in the next G pitch in the Scottish Borders in Melrose.ldquoThe council has a proud track record of delivering community synthetic pitches across the Scottish Borders and the Melrose proposal will make a signicant dference to sports clubs in the town.\"It will enhance football and rugby and give many generations of young people access to a first class sporting facility.ldquoThe pitch is owned by the Ormiston Trust, whose sole aim is to make sure that it provides important community facilities for all and this community investment in Melrose will certainly do that.\"We look forward to the project being delivered.The all year round playing surface will be open to all local sports clubs and schools.As well as a G pitch and floodlights, the approved plans also include a new spectator walkway.And the detailed plans, which are being supported by Scottish Rugby, will be on show during a drop-in session at the Greenyards on Tuesday, June  between pm and pm.Melrose RFC chairman Gordon Brown added: \"Melrose Rugby is delighted at this news.ldquoThis has been a long-standing ambition of the club since the launch of our Legacy project in .\"The new G pitch will allow the club to continue competing at the highest level as well as being an incredible asset that will enable other sporting activities and events.ldquoThe club would like to thank all our support partners in approving this exciting project.\"It will mark an exciting new chapter for us as we open our doors to the local community and others in the surrounding area.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming anyone interested in seeing the plans to the Greenyards on  June.Although contentious in footballing circles, G surfaces have been given the thumbs up from rugbys governing body.The SRUs director for Edinburgh, Borders and Lothian, David Drummond, told us: ldquoScottish Rugby believes this move to a G surface is a positive step at the Greenyards to help the rugby club and the wider sporting and local community enjoy access on a more regular basis, together with the subsequent health benefits that will bring.ldquoWe know pitches in Scotland come under signicant pressure throughout the season so the level of investment and commitment from Scottish Borders Council to improve this facility was something we wanted to support and contribute towards.ldquoWe are supporting new G pitch projects across Scotland and this opportunity in the Borders is another example of Scottish Rugby investing to help clubs become more sustainable and have high-quality facilities to engage existing and future players."},{"url":null,"title":"glendinning-pupils-are-chess-champs-of-the-borders","story":"PUPILS from Glendinning Primary School have been declared chess champs of the Borders.The budding grand masters from Galashiels saw off competition from across the region to claim the title in the Volunteer Hall last week.But Aidan Falconer, Kyle Anderson, Frank Rogerson and Shane Ross were made to work hard for the trophy in a thrilling move-for-move final with Earlston pupils.A total of  school teams took part -

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay.

My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

A pound token can help make sure that every child we support has a day out during the summer.ldquoMany of us will be planning elaborate holidays, but for some children and families just one day out can provide a vital break from everyday problems. To have these experiences is a really important part of growing up.Ruth provides some examples of the experiences that are made possible by the appeal.ldquoOur Family Resource Centre in Ruchazie is very much about getting families out together, but at other services children need a break from whatrsquos going on for them at home, so our support workers accompany the children.ldquoChildren can choose their own day out. One young man wanted to go to the art galleries in Glasgow.

Hersquos doing his best to look after everyone, but they are all struggling. Sophie needs a break, but this family has so little, they have no hope of financing that.Ruth Park says that bereavement is an area that Quarriers recognises as important to help with. ldquoIt is such a time of change for children.

His field of expertise, known as ldquohereditarian science, was for decades shunned because of the appalling use to which theories of supposedly inherent racial dference had previously been put. To the ranks of disbelievers can probably now be added those cash-strapped parents who have sacriced holidays, cars and clothes to pay eye-watering fees for their kids.Until lately, environmental factors have been seen as the main factor in a personrsquos success or failure. However, Plomin persuasively argues that a childrsquos future is determined  per cent by their genes. Environment also accounts for  per cent, but according to his research, an inidualrsquos response to this is largely a product of their genetic heritage. In short, our parents have a lot to answer for.Yet while Plomin is adamant that itrsquos a pupilrsquos background that determines their exam results, he is also aware that choosing a private school is usually about much more than winning top grades. Fettes or Gordonstoun, Roedean or Harrow are seen as exclusive institutions where sons and daughters will meet the right class of people and ndash as importantly ndash not have to mingle with the wrong. Long after they have left the dorm and playing fields, these old chums will form a network whose efficacy in helping them up the greasy pole is affirmed by the front benches at Westminster.As Plomin writes of his conclusions, ldquoI hope it will help parents who cannot afford to pay for private schooling or move house to know that it doesnrsquot make much of a dference in childrenrsquos school achievement. Clearly he recognises the financial dilemma facing those, not in the first rank of wealth, who want their kids to have the best possible start in le and think itrsquos worth almost bankrupting themselves to put them through the elite system. If his evidence of the superiority of nature over nurture is right, then it rebuts the age-old belief that money solves every problem, and that those born on the cusp of an overdraft are on the back foot from day one.Read more: Rosemary Goring: Do not rush to judge Theresa May or any other leaderRaised as I was in a family of teachers convinced that the state sectorrsquos better-qualied staff offered a finer education, I was, you might say, indoctrinated about the deficiencies of fee-paying establishments from an early age. The opening pages of Evelyn Waughrsquos The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold merely confirmed that view, although in recent years Irsquove had to acknowledge that private education has improved considerably since I last dipped into an inkwell.Yet the most important message to take from Plominrsquos work is not that any school will serve its educational purpose. Rather, it is that responsibility for a childrsquos intellectual capabilities lies with parents, not teachers. Home is where the future lies. For years now, teachers, be they state sector or private, have increasingly been expected to take on the roles of nanny and counsellor, nutritionist, health advisor and social worker, not to mention become expert in conflict resolution. All this as well as their bread and butter task as educator.When a child does not excel, parents demand to know why. The blame for poor results or under-performance is too often laid at the teacherrsquos door, when mum and dad should instead be looking into a mirror. This is not to say that every teacher is above reproach. But it is to suggest that on balance, parents should ask not what school can do for their child but what they can do for their child ndash and have already done, through no virtue or neglect on their part.Money aside, on the question of state v private education, there now seems a simple distinction. Private institutions offer a one-stop shop, in which extracurricular activities are gathered under a single umbrella. In contrast, many pupils at ordinary schools are like popcorn in a microwave, bouncing from one out-of-hours ersion to another, be it football or ballet, violin or swimming lessons, Rainbow Club or Scouts.Thanks to these myriad options, the distinctiveness of fee-paying schools is being whittled away. In addition, children at after-class events are mingling with a far wider group than could be found in private establishments. As a result, the private sector is in more danger of appearing narrow and restrictive than elitist.That, of course, is a separate discussion. For the moment, Plominrsquos results should simply help calm the angst that blights so many parentsrsquo lives.

In India, Narendra Modi and his BJP have just been re-elected overwhelmingly, helped by their flirtation with Hindutva, Hindu nationalism, and by his high-risk, contrived military confrontation with Pakistan. And Vladimir Putin has always traded on Russian nationalism to maintain support.Closer to home, we have seen a marked rise in English nationalism as the Brexit debate has progressed. Not all Brexiters are nationalists, but an alarming number certainly are. As Michel Barnier has commented, therersquos a nostalgic longing for the days when the UK was the dominant world power and to be born into a prosperous, white British family was to win the lottery on Day One. And, of course, for the English nationalist, English and British are synonyms.Strangely enough, the SNP, the Scottish National Party, isnrsquot nationalist. Thatrsquos something that took me a while to get my head around, given the partyrsquos name perhaps it would have been betterit had been called the Scottish Peoplersquos Party or somesuch. The SNP is an internationalist party it recognises that Scotland is a small country on the periphery of Europe, with world-class universities, a skilled workforce and a strong reputation. It also recognises that, to capitalise on those strengths, Scotland has to work closely with others and to be an open, welcoming and inclusive country.

I am surprised that the SNP has not banned this most unwelcome rival for the fascinated devotion of young people who will visit it and, horror of horrors, possibly become so enamoured of Egyptology as to wish to dedicate their careers to it. After all, STEMsubjects are all the rage these days and those bright intellects among the secondary school population whose interests, temperament and professional aspirations could be triggered to pursue a very dferentdiscipline like Egyptology are seemingly to be quashed and indoctrinated into more economically productive fields. And not just Ancient Egypt, but the vast, wider ancient world with its perennial lure of countless specialisms like Roman Britain, Pompeii, Linear B, Flavian epic, Ciceronian rhetoric, Aristotelian philosophy, Assyriology, Semitic philology and Biblical criticism.The present controversy over contraction of subject options is well documented. What hope is there, then, for a potential distinguished Egyptologist, such as those nurtured in th century Scottish schools, when the necessary foundation of linguistic expertise in French, German, Latin and Greekis nowhere on offer  Not a single Scottish university boasts a venerable department of Egyptology such as is found in Liverpool, Birmingham, London, Oxford and Cambridge.

We are a relatively new organisation who are delighted by the spread of outdoor nurseries and the number of schools who are implementing play.

this is about Britain, culture as a whole: at the moment, the problems that we have had are with authors living outside Europe.ldquoAfter Brexit, our major concern is that this will affect authors based within Europe, and therefore there is an urgent need to sort this out not just in order that we get authors from the Middle East, Africa, Palestine and so on, but also so that we can continue to hear voices from France, Germany, Spain, Italy.The book festival this year is inviting authors from  dferent countries, but unless the problems with visas can be sorted, the book festival will have ldquosignicantly fewer international writers, and ldquowe will be a signicantly less influential festival on the world stage, Mr Barley added.The festival, which runs from  to  August, this year has the theme of lsquoWe Need New Storiesrsquo.It will once again have stages in George Street, and this year its main tent will be sponsored by US newspaper, the New York Times.Arundhati Roy will make her first appearance in Edinburgh in conversation with the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.Keneally and Markus Zusak , the Australian writer, will also make their debuts, and other writers and artists will include Julia Donaldson and illustrator Axel Scheffler, James Meek and Deborah Levy.The composer Sir James MacMillan will launch his memoir and Branko Milanovic, the economist, will be interviewed by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown.The actor and comedian Eddie Izzard will talk about his audio recording of Dickensrsquo Great Expectations and other writers will include Kate Atkinson, Harry Hill, Clare Balding, Tim Winton, David Nicholls, Benjamin Myers, Naomi Wolf, Joanne Harris, and Mark Haddon.Writer Roddy Doyle will be in conversation with Blindboy, one half of the Irish comedy hip-hop duo Rubberbandits.The former BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie will launches her new book Equal, and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson will be in conversation with Olympian rower Katherine Grainger, and other guests will included Channel rsquos Cathy Newman, Labour MP Rachel Reeves and broadcaster Mariella Frostrup.A key voice in the US movement Black Lives Matter, DeRay Mckesson, will make his first appearance in Edinburgh as one of the  Guest Selectors, while Val McDermid tackles Home Less in her Guest Selector strand, speaking to Ali Smith, Karine Polwart and Palestinian author Nayrouz Qarmout about iniduals and families whove faced the decision to leave their homeland.The festivalrsquos partnership with the Royal Lyceum Theatre Edinburgh s for a third year with one-off interpretations of three \"new cult classics\": Miriam Toewsrsquo Women Talking, Charlotte Higginsrsquo Under Another Sky and David Keenanrsquos This is Memorial Device."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-exports-to-the-eu-surge-by-nearly-19","story":"New HMRC data shows Scottish exports grew at a quicker rate than any other UK nation or English region, with a total increase of .% -

But he wants to be PM not a dictator.\"An angry John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, also intervened, insisting he would not allow MPs to be sidelined.\"Parliament will not be evacuated from the centre stage of the decision-making process on this important matter. Thats simply not going to happen,\" he declared.Parliamentary expert Hannah White, deputy director of the Institute for Government thin-tank, said any move to prorogue in these circumstances \"would amount to a coup against Parliament and risk bringing the Queen into a terrible conflict\".She explained: \"The implication of Raabs refusal to rule out this strategy is that he thinks it would potentially be legitimate to suspend Parliament, not simply to let the Article  clock run down but to prevent MPs from making a decision he knows they would want to take.\"This would be extremely controversial, particularly in these circumstances because the Government does not have a majority.\"Asking the Queen to give effect to this strategy would draw her into a massive political debate something which Number  and the Palace are normally at great pains to avoid.\"Dr White suggested that Buckingham Palace \"would look for ways to limit the Queen being drawn into the process\", possibly by delaying long enough to allow Parliament the opportunity to prevent prorogation.One way, she noted, could be through a no-confidence motion to bring down the Government.\"The effect of attempting to prorogue Parliament to pursue a no-deal policy to which it has thus far been firmly opposed would likely be to prompt an election. That may even be the intention,\" added Dr White.A source close to Mr Raab said: ldquoHis point is thatParliament wonrsquot rule out what options they will use, then why would the executive rule out options \"A supporter of the former Cabinet minister pointed out that ruling out a no-deal Brexit or seeking an extension beyond October  meant \"weakening our negotiating leverage in Brussels\".He added: \"Dominic made clear that he would use every lever of the executive to ensure that the UK can leave the EU at the end of October.\"But the suggestion of prorogation caused a backlash among Conservative colleagues.Mr Hancock wrote to his rivals, saying: \"To suspend Parliament explicitly to pursue a course of action against its wishes is not a serious policy of a prime minister in the st century.\"What kind of message would this send around the world about our values when so many have given so much for the rights of democratic freedom \"Rory Stewart, the International Development Secretary and another leadership contender, said proroguing Parliament would be \"unlawful, undemocratic, and unachievable\" and \"the idea itself is profoundly offensive to our liberty, constitution and traditions\".Amber Rudd, the Work and Pensions Secretary and a leading player in the One Nation group, said: \"Its outrageous to consider proroguing Parliament.

They stretched for as far as the eye could see. “We waited for what seemed like an interminable amount of time before we could go on shore. We felt like easy targets for the Luftwaffe. \u2028“A couple of ships were hit and we just hoped and prayed that ours would not be one of the next ones. “For some reason, I remember that I did not even get my feet wet when we eventually came on shore as we were on landing craft vehicles.”Johns most vivid memory of June , , was the Armada of ships lying off-shore.

Airdrie was just  when he sailed on a Royal Marine landing craft from Portsmouth to Gold Beach. Today, he will be making the journey once again on the th aniversary of D-Day, in hopes of meeting up with some of his old comrades on the journey. For those who survived the onslaught at Normandy, it’s a day that has lived long in their memories.And in this, the th anniversary year of the landings, some  of the survivors – most now in their s – are making a poignant pilgrimage to the beaches on which they served.Poppyscotland, Legion Scotland and the Royal British Legion have chartered the cruise ship MV Boudicca to take them to Bayeux in style – exactly  years to the day since the infamous landings.After setting sail from Dover on Sunday, the veterans took centre stage at national commemorative events in Portsmouth on Wednesday before retracing their famous journey across the Channel today .Fresh-faced...Denis Gregson and his fellow crewmen spent more than three months at Gold Beach, helping to build its mulberry harbour.Among those on board are six Scottish veterans who, prior to their departure, posed for stunning portraits to highlight their remarkable stories – taken on a Graflex Super D large format film camera made in the USA in the s.Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland, said: “The remarkable stories of these six Scottish veterans provide us with an important reminder of both the bravery and tragedy which surrounds that day. “It will be an honour and a privilege to host these incredible gentlemen and to recognise the immense contribution of an entire generation.”Prior to their departure, we met one of the veterans, Denis Gregson, at his home in Airdrie.\" title\"In , Denis was honoured with Frances highest medal of distinction, the Legion dHonneur, in recognition of his service on

It’s a long time ago but, thinking about it now, it was not pleasant to see that.”The noise of that longest of days has also lived loud in Denis’s memory.He said: “The guns never stopped firing for a full  hours from morning through the night to the following morning.“I always wondered what the French civilians thought of it – farmers getting up for their work and being caught up in it all.”Denis spent more than three months in France, with just one three-day break from the action. But once he and his crew helped to create a mulberry harbour – to facilitate the rapid offloading of cargo onto Gold Beach – they ed home.He was later posted to Kiel, a submarine base in Germany which was guarded until the war ended.He then escorted a German destroyer to Rosyth and by Christmas , Denis was back home in Leeds.Demobbed in August , he married Doreen in July  and became a cooper, moving to Airdrie where he has lived for more than half a century.Denis was honoured with France’s highest medal of distinction, the Legion d’Honneur, in  in recognition of his service on D-Day.

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route. There are also plans for the installation of electric vehicle charging points, as well as  electric bicycles for use by members of the public.For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Having been extracted in the lab, the DNA has been sequenced and compared against known species, creating a near-definitive list of everything that lives in the loch for the first time.The results of the study were supposed to be published in January, but cataloguing the extensive range of micro-organisms and bacteria has taken longer than expected.The team has found around  dferent species of fish and up to , species of bacteria, some of which will have been deposited in Loch Ness by animals using connecting rivers.Prof Gemmell said he hoped to announce the full findings of the study at a press conference in Scotland next month.“Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm. It depends what you believe,” he said. “Is there anything startling  There are a few things that are a bit surprising.“What we’ll have achieved is what we set out to do, which is document the bioersity of Loch Ness in June  in some level of detail.“We’ve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say aren’t right and one of them might be.”Although Prof Gemmell would not confirm which hypothesis might be right, the two main theories about the monster is it is a long-necked plesiosaur that somehow survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct, or it is a sturgeon or giant catfish.Prof Gemmell admitted that part of the reason for the delay in publishing the results was due to a series of failed attempts to film a television documentary.Negotiations with a series of production companies ended without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed line up unveiled for 2019 edinburgh international book festival","story":"Comedians Harry Hill, Sue Perkins and Eddie Izzard, former Blue Peter presenters Konnie Huq and Janet Ellis, singers Tracey Thorn and Karine Polwart, and the military historian and journalist Max Hastings are set to be among the main draws.The biggest ever international line-up of authors, drawn from a record  countries, has been invited to the event, tickets for which go on sale on  June.Key themes include the impact of the technology revolution and the domination of social media, the climate crisis, race and identity, and the gender pay gap in Britain.

Overall a victory for hope not hate. Lest we forget what international solidarity and cooperation sounds like:Love it. What a wonderful man and what a great work – one of Europe’s greatest composers and one of Europe’s greatest poets – a sublime combination. Here’s to Europe and Europeans: Wo dein zanfter Flügel weiltThis has always been my favourite stanza, but I’ve yet to find a satisfactory English translation – one that conveys the humanity as well as the poetry. Would you happen to have one Peter as ian says your discount the exit tories and labour. and best for remain itsa draw at worse its a good win for leave.In Britain, the total Remain vote was larger than the total Leave vote :. you claim that is not true.O dear me, Peter, you have absolutely forgotten both the Tories and the Labour voters.

Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth.

Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three. This of course, was reflected in Shetland’s EU election result.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant. Working in close collaboration with the chefs and kitchen teams, the apprentices will develop, prepare and serve Climavore dishes to support and develop alternative aquacultures that promote cleaner usage of the tidal zone.The programme will be launched with a celebratory meal on Saturday st June at the oyster table in Portree. Prepared in partnership with the pupils, diners will be treated to a lunch of scallop ceviche, oysters, seaweed soup and carrageen panna cotta, washed down with a Harris Gin and sea buckthorn cocktail.Events on Sunday nd June will include a walk to a rare native Skye oyster habitat, which will be followed by a screening of the recently-released film #Artishal# at the Aros Centre in Portree.

He said: #All across the Scottish isles, the United Kingdom and across the planet we are witnessing a tremendous loss of bioersity and extensive pollution of our air, land, and waterways. In the UK and all around the world, the environments we leave to future generations are in a fragile state.#Climavore questions how we eat as humans changes climate and develops programmes to provide tools to young residents of Skye to transform food practices, ecologies and environments to become better places for humans, plants and animals living along the tidal zone.#Atlas Arts producer Shona Cameron added: #Working with the students and teachers at Portree High School over the last year has been an exciting development for this project. The students have shown real enthusiasm to learn about the local ingredients and engage in conversations that question sustainability.#It has been brilliant to see restaurants across the islands continue to show enthusiasm towards the aims of Climavore and demonstrate a willingness to take on apprentices, working with them to bring Climavore dishes to their menus.

The late Peter McCambridge won his Distinguished Conduct Medal on the Longest Day - but he had, in fact, dropped into Normandy in the late evening of June , .Anyone who has seen the film of The Longest Day will remember the scenes featuring Richard Todd and the Glider troops of the Oxs and Bucks Light Infantry attacking Pegasus Bridge.Mr. McCambridge, then an NCO with the thParachute Btn. of the th Airborne Division, was fighting only yards from this famous action in the nearby village of Le Port.In later years, Peter McCambridge was a familiar figure in Ballymena. He lived at Wilson Crescent and was a keen walker. Few,any, would have known that the tall, bespectacled figure who went about his civilian le so quietly and modestly was one of the heroes of D-Day.This is what his citation recorded about the action:-  Unit : B Company, th Parachute Battalion. Service No. : . Awards : Distinguished Conduct Medal‘This NCO was one of the parachute troops who landed behind the German lines in Normandy on the night th th June . During the fighting for Beacutenouville bridge on the th June, McCambridges platoon was responsible for holding the village of Le Port. At one period his section became detached from the platoon and the fighting, which went on for  hours almost without pause, was particularly fierce. McCambridge noticed that one house dominated the scene of the fighting. By skilful use of a smoke grenade and displaying the greatest dash he got his section across a road swept by Machine Gun fire and into the house. He used anti-tank grenades to smash open the garden gate and the door of the house. Once inside the house he was completely cut off from the rest of his company, who actually had withdrawn slightly, but he was in a dominating position and became the target for the enemy who greatly outnumbered his section and were surrounding him. So well did he dispose his men however and so splendid was his leadership that he held this isolated house until the seaborne troops eventually entered the village from the other end, several hours later. At times the enemy were close enough to try and beat down the door by beating it with their rle butts - McCambridge dealt with such attacks by having grenades dropped on them from the upper windows. There is no doubt that the holding of this dominating house seriously weakened the enemy attacks and greatly assisted the battalion to carry out its job of holding the bridge. On the th June at Bois de Bavent during a company attack Sgt McCambridge, together with another NCO, saved the le of his platoon commander, who had been wounded and whose phosphorus bomb was burning in his pouch. Between them they extracted the burning bomb and dragged the officer to cover despite heavy and accurate mortar and Machine Gun fire.McCambridge has shown himself throughout the three weeks continuous fighting to be a truly magnicent NCO. He is calm, cheerful and always reliable.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

The seconds finished eighthin Reserve Division Four.Their record was as follows: P W D L PtsDficult as the season proved, it was still a great learning experience for the younger players. Although there were many ups and downs over the year, the team stuck together and there was a great spirit in the changing room, right up until the last game.The award winners for both teams was dominated by young players – an encouraging sign for the future.The first teams gongs were a family affair, with the Reain brothers, Josh and Matthew, iding up the trophies between them. These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect. And -year-old Nathan Thompson capped a wonderful season by taking home both the manager’s and players’ player of the year trophies. Nathan is a quiet young man – but on the pitch he makes his presence felt, and is a model defender who rarely makes a mistake.Clubman of the year was the popular Christopher Tate – a committee member and first team coach, Christopher puts his heart and soul into the club.Dromore Amateurs will hold their AGM in the clubrooms on Monday, June  at pm.

It was really satisfying, there were no TVs, no gaming machines, managing there was all about conversation.”Gerry spoke of how the initial spark of the Jawbox brand came about due to his “wee bit of entrepreneurial spirit” – the ‘spirit’ being his drink of choice.“In all the years I’ve worked in bars the only spirit I’ve ever liked was gin. I had the idea of producing my own gin, bringing out my own brand. If it didn’t work I was more than happy to stay on as a barman, I would’ve always regretted never giving it a go.”Gerry said the process took over two and a half years from the concept to getting the name registered.“I did come close to giving up but all the right people came together, the absolute best of the best, with Echlinville distiller Shane Branf, his head distiller Graham Miller and packaging and branding coming from Drinksology. Everything started to move dead fast.”The launch night of Jawbox took place in late February  – “a night of one of the worst storms, so I wasn’t hopeful people were going to turn up” – at the Linehall Library, with a little help from the then Lord Mayor Arder Carson.“I didn’t want to launch Jawbox in a bar, every other bar would’ve gone ‘Well, why didn’t you launch it in my bar ’ I wanted something ‘old Belfast’ and at the start Linenhall [Library] told me that didn’t really do launches as such. I loved the setting and told them I had the Lord Mayor on board – I just had to ask him,” he laughed.“I then went over to City Hall and said ‘Any chance of speaking to the Lord Mayor ’ The staff were brilliant and Arder came over and fair play as he likes a brandy.“The next day, when it was being rolled out, I think almost every bar in Belfast took it.”In the event, over  people turned up to support Gerry that night – “one of their own”Jawbox is now served in bars across Ireland, has its own mural in Kelly’s Cellars, is the go-to spirit at Belfast International Airport, is served across the water as well as its signature label displayed in over , retail outlets in England, Wales and Scotland.Recently awarded Supplier of the Year at the Institute of Hospitality Awards at Titanic Belfast, Gerry was one of five artisan suppliers chosen to showcase his product at a reception for Prince Charles and Camilla at the Grand Central on Wednesday.“The name comes from my granny, Maisie, Maisie Cunningham, who would always say to us ‘In my day we all stood round the jawbox and did our washing,’ as not everyone had the pleasure or the luxury of having their own shared washing area. Everything would have been washed in a big Belfast sink, clothes, dishes, the baby –everything was washed in it. People shared their stories, told their tales, it was their jaws going round the box. I always say to people to this very day, when they have parties, where do people go  The kitchen. Everybody stands around the sink.”It’s evident just how much pride and enthusiasm Gerry has for the product that has grown at a speed he never foresaw just three years ago.“The award for Supplier of the Year meant an amazing amount to me, it was my fth time being shortlisted, twice for Jawbox, always the bridesmaid, never the bride. It was fantastic.”The -year-old says the power to promote Jawbox via social media is “amazing”.“There are places Jawbox is appearing that I would never know. Philip Schofield posted a bottle to his Snapchat, everybody was ringing me saying ‘did you see it  Did you see it ’”Having grown up in C­onway Street and later Lenadoon, Gerry has his base just off Queen’s University Belfast. “Where will the next three years take Jawbox ” I ask him. He replies: “The States.”“You only get one chance in America. It’s a matter of making sure we have the right importer, distributor. Sean Muldoon and Jack McCarty from the Dead Rabbit are out there who are going to be so supportive. I used to work with Sean in the Northern Whig. “Just two weeks ago Jawbox was used as the reception drink for the Irish Film Festival in Australia, we launched in Sweden.”Inbetween “surprising” those who take part in weekly ‘Gin Jaunts’ every Saturday afternoon as part of the extremely popular Taste and Tour experience, Gerry hosts Jawbox gin evenings at ious hotels were he shares his passion with others keen to hear how Jawbox was born.“I was really surprised to see how many young people turn up to these events. I nearly dropped when someone asked me to sign a bottle recently.“What I set out to do from the start was build a legacy, make the product authentic, that’s why my signature is on the bottle. I knew from the start that the quality of this product had to be better than anything  out there.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"loughinisland journalists re united with seized belongings","story":"TWO journalists who had materials seized by police after their documentary into the Loughinisland massacre have collected their belongings from the police.Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey were arrested in August  over the suspected theft of confidential files, shortly after the release of their documentary ‘No Stone Unturned’.On Tuesday, both men collected their possessions from Castlereagh police station which included laptops, hard drives, mobile phones, notepads and millions of digital files.On Monday, Durham Constabulary dropped their investigation after a judicial review last week ruled the search warrants linked to the raids on the two journalists’ homes would be quashed.Both men were released from police bail.Sinn Féin MLA Gerry Kelly called on Durham Police and the PSNI to apologise to the journalists and the victims of the Loughinisland Massacre. “This is a victory for freedom of the press.“Durham Police has done the right thing dropping the case against Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey.“This case should never have been pursued in the first place.“The two journalists should be thanked for doing their job and providing a service to society by shining a light on state collusion in the Loughinisland massacre.“They exposed British State involvement in one of the most notorious atrocities of the conflict. “The police response was to arrest the journalists rather than pursue those responsible for the massacre and cover up.“Freedom of the press is a fundamental principle in any democracy. “The Chief Constables of Durham Police and the PSNI should apologise to Barry McCaffrey and Trevor Birney as well as their journalistic colleagues and the Loughinisland families.“Durham Constabulary’s Chief Constable Mike Barton said: “Following the outcome of last week’s judicial review, a decision has now been taken not to progress the investigation into those two iniduals and both will be immediately released from police bail.“We are in the process of concluding what has been a highly complex investigation, with some final lines of inquiry still to be assessed. These lines of inquiry do not include the journalists, Mr Birney or Mr McCaffrey, as suspects in the investigation.“At all times, my officers have acted in good faith, within the law and followed due process. The warrant application was originally submitted to and approved by a county court judge. We do, however, accept and respect the decision of the High Court last week.“We plan to produce a final report to the Chief Constable of the PSNI outlining all of our findings.”In response PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said: “In , PSNI became aware of an alleged theft and or unlawful leaking of sensitive documents relating to the Loughinisland investigation from the Office of the Police Ombudsman. To ensure independence and address any conflict of interest I asked Durham Constabulary to conduct the investigation.“I am grateful to Durham Constabulary and to Chief Constable Mike Barton for the work they have conducted on our behalf in this sensitive investigation. I have always accepted the autonomy of Chief Constable Barton’s inquiry and I fully concur with his decision not to progress the investigation into the two journalists Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey.“Throughout the period of this investigation, the horror of what happened in Loughinisland has never been far from any of our thoughts. The perpetrators of that crime have never been brought to justice and that is a matter of huge regret for policing.“The police investigation into who murdered the six innocent men in the Heights Bar in  remains open but progress is dependent on new information. There are people out there who know what happened. I would appeal to them to come forward and make a statement that will help us finally bring justice to the families of the victims.“I am aware that the investigation over the last year has caused concern for families who have already suffered so much. That is something none of us would ever have wished to do.“However, as a police service, the suspected theft or unlawful leaking of any sensitive documents containing information that may endanger le is a serious matter which we are statutorily obliged to investigate.“Recognising the sensitivities, we asked an independent Police Service to conduct the investigation. The clarity provided by last week’s hearing has now brought a signicant part of that investigation to a conclusion.“I await the final report from Durham on this complex investigation.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tim and jake unveiled as feile comedy leads","story":"NORTH is set to meet West as Belfast’s comedy big hitters come together for Féile an Phobail’s annual comedy night.

Mr Javid continued: \"In my departmentat the moment Ive got border force and weve done work for months on what an alternative to that arrangement could look like and whats missing is that good will. \"What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. \"I think it could be done in a couple of years but I think we could cover their costs.\""},{"url":null,"title":"huge rise in number of british nationals applying to become irish after brexit referendum","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Were used to Americans coming over and flattering the Irish with faux praise about how their ancestors built their country. Trump is somewhat dferent, though.Sources say the US President told Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that he always thinks of the Republic as \"a huge country\" because of the impact its people have had. Varadkar happily told him the country has just five million people.It was one of the lighter moments in a meeting that briskly moved from serious topics to sport. Brexit, immigration and all featured, before conversation swayed to The Open. At one point the Irish side found itself explaining how, for some sports, the whole island plays as one team, while for others, there are Republic and Northern Ireland teams. The US President was fascinated. Insiders say the atmosphere was \"warm\", which probably matched the temperature in the makesht meeting room that was dressed up with a few net curtains and colourful flowers. On the American side, Trump had some big hitters, but they didnt throw any punches. There was his Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin. Varadkars back-up team included his Chief of Staff, Brian Murphy, main Brexit brain John Callinan, US envoy John Deasy and Ambassador Dan Mulhall. Even before the meeting began, it was obvious Trump was in a good mood. He allowed journalists to fire questions at him for eight minutes without trading any insults. He also denied being in Ireland to play golf and promote his hotel but struggled to show that he had done any actual preparation for the meeting. The Taoiseach was brave enough to publicly correct him when he tried to compare the Irish border situation with his plans to build a wall between the US and Mexico. \"His basic knowledge isnt great,\" a source admitted. However, Mr Varadkar insisted afterwards that the purpose of the meeting was to educate the US delegation.Soon, Trump and his we, Melania, were on board a chopper bound for Doonbeg. Irish officials were more than a little relieved. Mr Varadkar went on to defend the cost of providing , unormed and  specialist gardai for the trip. \"The good bilateral relationship between Ireland and America is worth a lot more than €m,\" he said. Trump is unlikely to have taken in much of what was said, but he didnt call anybody, including Michael D Higgins, a stone cold loser. No real damage done, then, which is the best they could have hoped for. There was no mention of wind turbines or fake news. \"I learn from my mistakes,\" the Taoiseach laughed as he left the post-match analysis session.  data-dfpadtargeting and First Lady Melania Trumpdisembark Air Force One upon arrival at Shannon Airport in Shannon, County Clare, Ireland on June , .

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily. While I want the council to take the lead on this issue, I hope many other bodies it works alongside will follow suit.ldquoWorking together we can make a dference and help people change their lives. The councilrsquos lead on this issue could have a ripple effect across the district beyond.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThis is not about being a kill joy but encouraging people to be more health conscious when it comes to what they eat and drink and is the first step in a process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown to DownTime summer festival  ","story":"THE countdown is on for this monthrsquos spectacular DownTime summer festival which has something for everyone.Organisers of the four-day community event mdash which kicks off on June  mdash are promising a sparkling festival of fun which includes two daysrsquo of not-to-be-missed horse racing at the widely acclaimed Downpatrick track.Horse racing first took place at in Downpatrick in  and for almost  years the local track has been constantly improving, boasting great racing, modern facilities, themed race days and a rather unique atmosphere.DownTime summerfest has been organised by a dedicated local team from all sectors of the community whose aim is to get people out and about not just over the four-day festival, but across the summer.Now in its second year, the festival is supported by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and features over  events covering arts, heritage, music, food and, of course, sport.There will be street art, live music, theatre performances, free train rides, a living history Viking encampment at the St Patrick Centre and an artisan market mdash which will be open between am and .pm mdash cradled in the grounds of the Down County Museum.Locals and visitors alike will experience a haven of freshly produced food, bespoke crafts and relaxing surroundings.

Apart from a host of blister complaints, the bulk of real casualties were a handful of people taken to Downe Hospital suffering from heat exhaustion.One woman suffering from exhaustion had to be taken by an RAF helicopter to the Red Cross mobile treatment room and a man, who was knocked unconscious when a small boulder struck him on the head, was also taken to hospital.Despite minor upsets, the whole day was a big success story.

With winter over, during which time many elderly residents were effectively trapped in their homes after dark, the news may not be much consolation for residents.The committee also heard that their plea for a telephone kiosk at Cuan Beach had been refused and that an alternative site has been found for the Toye Kiosk at the New Line.ANNSBOROUGH mdash The youngsters of Annsborough have at last been able to use their new playing fields where a mix-up in the erection of a fence had kept them out for several months. Grazing cattle which have been using the field have been banished to the sidelines behind a new fence.The problem started when Enterprise Ulster erected only one fence at the new playground and forgot about s second fence to keep out nearby cattle.

He started out on his footballing journey as a fresh-faced teenager in the mid s alongside his brother Denis, the McClurgs and Pattersons at Kilmore United, and was an integral part of the embryo that was to become Kilmore Rec.Originally from Inch, just outside Downpatrick, Cyril followed Denis to Killyleagh YCin  and that was the start of a close link with the club that lasted the best part of  years.He spent a decade at The Showgrounds before moving to Drumaness Mills where he again endeared himself to all at Meadowvale with his goals and whole-hearted play.When he hung up his boots in the mid s he bided his time before taking up the role as manager at Drumaness with his pal Paul Gelston mdash he also had managerial spells at Ballynahinch Unitedand Kilmore Rec.However, in  he ed to The Showgrounds to team up with Dee Heron and together they set about building one of the best team sides to play in the Amateur League.They won everything there was to win with the exception of the Intermediate Cup.They lted the Steel  Sons, Border and Clarence Cup with regularity, as well as six Amateur League Premier Section titles in a row.In addition to his time at Killyleagh, Cyril was Heronrsquos assistant with the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team and also teamed up with Nortelrsquos Ricky Beggs as manager of the Amateur League U- youth team for three years.In more recent years Cyril, although he wasnrsquot attached to any club, still followed the highs and lows of all local outfits and loved nothing better than travelling to watch Northern Ireland.Sincere condolences are expressed to his we Betty, daughters Jenner, Pamela and Heather, and extended family circle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Walking along path of history on the Camino pilgrimage  ","story":"THE faint sound of a church bell ringing in the distance, a cockerel crowing under a leafy olive grove at sunrise or the thunderous crash of an Atlantic wave as it beats off a rocky shoreline in northern Portugal became a welcome replacement to the bustle of Downpatrick last month.For  days, my friend Shona and I ventured the -mile trek of the Camino Portuguese from the beautul and vibrant city of Porto to Santiago de Compostela in neighbouring Galicia, in northern Spain.Time stood still as we listened to the rhythmic crunch of sandy gravel underfoot and breathed in the soft pine-scented woodland pathways that led to an ever increasing number of pilgrims making their way up through the captivating beauty of the Camino da Costa mdash just one of many routes leading to the famous cathedral which is the final resting place of St James the Apostle.Our journey began after a seriously hearty breakfast in one of the many fabulous street-side cafes in Porto on Thursday, May . The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing. Yet,  miles later, with a one and a half stone weight packed inside our rucksacks and the unwelcome emergence of a cluster of painful blisters forming, we were singing with joy as we arrived at the popular surfing resort of Esposende in the Braga district later that afternoon.Day three began in much the same way, neither of us forgetting the miracle cure that can be derived from a good nightrsquos sleep. We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17681842.ni-water-to-begin-works-this-month-delays-expected/resources/images/9943685.jpg","title":"emmerdale makes david cameron pig joke","story":"mdash Rina HansonJune , mdash Shaun EleyJune , mdash Matthew ChapmanJune , mdash EmmerdaleJune , This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Businesswoman and fashionista Shirley“We’ve seen a few clips but we don’t get to see the whole episodes until the public sees them.”While it’s been billed as Northern Ireland’s equivalent as TOWIE and Made In Cha the characters come across as being a lot more down to earth.Ruth, , said: “It’s just the way we are everyday. People in Co Tyrone are very genuine.“It might come across as we all know each other but a lot of the people in the show I hadn’t met until we came together for the programme.Country singer Neil“I’d never met Bobby or Lynda or Audrey or Melvin. We’re all friendly now.“Even when I met them and the cameras weren’t on we got on really well. Bobby constantly had me in stitches. He could have his own show.“We’re from Dungannon. Lynda is Omagh direction, Audrey I think she’s up by Clogher.NI athlete Erin McConnell happy to rise before am to achieve Olympic dream\"  \"  Reported On This Day  Years Ago : Entry rules for the Downpatrick races are listed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The way it’s filmed it might seem that we live closer together.”Ruth said she had some dficulties with the cameras to begin with but soon found her feet: “When it was being filmed they said, ‘pretend we’re not here’. At the start I was accidentally looking into the lens. After a while, after the second or third time, you do forget the cameras are there.” Ruth explained how she got involved with the programme which was filmed at the start of last summer: “They went to my friend’s salon and they were giving out flyers trying to find someone who comes from a farming background and is also into the beauty and all. Helen said about me and passed on my details. They contacted me and I said I’d be interested, it sounds like great craic.”Ruth revealed that it wasn’t technically her TV debut: “When I was in primary school I was in school choir of the year, but that was in a choir and I’m a blur.”In one scene, Ruth who is a member of a gun club takes two of her friends shooting: “Hollie had shot once before, Helen had never shot in her le. We just sort of thought we’d go for the craic. That’s the sort of thing that we did for the show. It’s not like reality shows were they make drama for the sake of it.”Ruth described herself as “a part time farmer, part time beautician and a full time mum”. She said: “Maisie is two this week. She’s not in the show but I do talk about her.“I have a boyfriend, we’re not married or engaged. We’ve been going out for three and half years and we’ve been friends since we were .”During her early days as beautician she needed someone to practice on. Cue her dad John: “When I was training as a beautician I had to practice eyebrow waxing. I got my kit and asked dad would he let me practice. I think I got one strip pulled off and he stopped me. He said he’d been in enough accidents on the farm but that was by the far the worst. He ended up with one bushy eyebrow and one normal one.”She added: “My oldest brother John is a full time farmer. He’s won’t be on the show, he’s a bit shy. He works on the farm with my dad and my dad’s friend Billy.“My mumhelps out on the farm before her own job as a classroom assistant in a special needs school.”Ruth appears in the show alongside her brother Neil. As a duo they’re used to being in the limelight together.She said: “Neil’s a country singer. We used to sing together. We were a two-piece band then I went to Australia for a year and he went out on his own.“He started to make it really well on his own so I left him to it. I started a new job as a beautician and helped my dad out on the farm.”So has she got the bitten by the TV bug “It’s was really good craic,” she said. “If there was a second series and they asked me to be in it, I’d definitely say yes. I suppose they’re waiting to see how the first series goes.”She added: “The first night the trailer was on TV quite a lot of people videoed it and sent it to me on Snapchat. A lot of people have taken an interest.”try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian Hutchinson escapes serious injury following high-speed crash in qualyingIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedSinger Malachi Cush lsquostablersquo in RVH following road collisionN.I. child reported missing is found safe and well*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Council told to reveal secret Master Plan document Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian Hutchinson escapes serious injury following high-speed crash in qualyingIncreasing concern for N.I. teen

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They toss, turn, and grade the shellfish according to size, before ing them to the seabed. Across the Lough we can see the Cooley Peninsula and Co Louth. In the Brexit border debate, this is ground zero.Growing oysters takes three years, says Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish, and he exports stock every week. “It leaves on a Friday evening at around pm, and % is exported to France. It goes through Dublin and Rosslare to the top oyster buyer in Europe. The oysters are in purication tanks in France by Sunday evening. That’s how quick it is.” Carlingford Oysters then travel to restaurants in Paris and other European capitals. How is business  “Very good,” Darren says. “We sold nearly  tonnes of oyster last year. Two tonnes went to China and the rest to France.” Is there much competition  “Not for us. We’re the talk at the minute. We have the best stuff.”Darren and his team work next to Ballyedmond Estate, the family home of the late Edward Haughey, founder of Norbrook, one of the world’s leading veterinary pharmaceutical companies. If you travel further up the lough – past Warrenpoint, home to Northern Ireland’s second largest port – you will reach Newry, where Norbrook is based.Killowen Shellfish and Norbrook, which generated an operating profit of £.m in the year to August , are very dferent businesses, yet both speak the common language of exports. There are around , VAT registered businesses in the greater Newry area and many of them are accustomed to criss-crossing the border.“We have a number of major global players based here in Newry who supply goods across the world,” Colm Shannon, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade says.He name-checks MJM Marine, a leader in the global marine industry, which employs  people in three offices across Europe. “Equally, we have a number of smaller companies who are involved in north-south trade. That’s usually the first step into the export market.”Exports are the essence of business for Re-Gen Waste, a Newry firm established in  by five siblings. Re-Gen began by recycling paper, cardboard, tin and plastics, before graduating to municipal waste and black bin waste. The family developed their own purpose-built facility in Newry, creating a business that generates millions. Its work is spread across Northern Ireland, the Republic and rest of the UK.According to John Doherty, a director at the business, Re-Gen “exports hundreds of tonnes across the border every day. We’re the fourth largest recycler in the Republic.” Its recycled products are exported to almost  countries around the globe. Re-Gen is not alone. Other successful Newry exporters include FM Environmental Group, which has offices in Malta and the Middle East. In , Newry’s BM Steel landed new business, in a deal worth £m, in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Around Noon, a producer of high-quality sandwiches, employs  people and has made acquisitions in Dublin and London. Newry-based construction firm mac-group is another all-island operation. In , it completed a £m refurbishment of River House, a -storey building in Belfast. Simultaneously, it was working the new Barclays headquarters in Dublin. “We employ over  people, across four dferent offices,” Brendan Moley, group interiors managing director at mac-group says. “The Newry office has  full time people. A lot of those staff members support projects in Dublin, London and Birmingham. There’s a lot of commuting back and forth across the border. We are trading in cross border services on a daily basis, but we’re also heavily involved in products and goods.”Although GB is Northern Ireland’s biggest external market, businesses in the Newry region are accustomed to cross border trade due to their geographical location. “We’ve always looked at Newry as being half way between Belfast and Dublin,” Brendan says. “You can get to Dublin Airport in  minutes from here. The talent available within the Newry market, in terms of some of staff, skill-set and knowledge, is extremely beneficial as well.”Some businesses fear that a hard border, in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, will cause delays. According to Darren Cunningham, only a few hundred lorries crossed the border every day in . That number is around , today. “A minute delay can knock everyone back hours,” he says. “My oysters can’t hold their breath forever. They’re a living creature. They only have a certain amount of time. The quicker they get to France, the better condition they’re in.”Re-Gen operates its own transport department. “Currently we send a lorry to Dublin twice in a day to collect materials,” John Doherty says. “If there is a delay at the border, you are likely require a second lorry. The cost of taking everything from the Republic to the north doubles.”Technology, such as unmanned border posts equipped with cameras, would be unlikely to solve the problem, suggests Brendan. “Any type of border control will impact business. Being from the border area myself, knowing how many crossings there are, I think it would be absolutely impossible to police it in any sensible way.”Newry businesses fear they will face mountains of costly paperwork post-Brexit. There may also be compliance issues, such as food traceability dficulties for food producers like Killowen Shellfish, construction product regulations for mac-group, or paper work for Re-Gen’s haulage drivers, whose Certicates of Professional Competencemay not be to be recognised in a post-Brexit EU. The Government has suggested imposing zero tarfs on goods from the EU in the event of no deal. Newry businesses believe this would put them at a competitive disadvantage. “The business community has expressed concerns that Northern Ireland will become a back door into the UK market for goods coming from the EU,” Colm Shannon says. “History tells you when you have iation of tarfs on the border, that’s an opportunity for smuggling.”Staff recruitment is another concern at Re-Gen, which has a -strong workforce. “We’re already finding it dficult to recruit staff,” John says. “Often, the people we’re hiring are seasonal and foreign workers. It’s the same for the agricultural industry, hotels...”But what about the arguments that a managed no-deal could be good for business  Firms would still have access to EU markets under WTO rules. Furthermore, the UK might strike lucrative trade deals in the years to come. Businesses around Newry are not buying this. Certainly not Norbrook, which has “an integrated supply chain, with a global supply base, which relies on frictionless trade,” according to Liam Nagle, the company boss.Uncertainty reigns for export businesses in the Newry area. “The chaotic nature in which this has been managed has restricted companies like ourselves from planning for the future,” Brendan Moley says. “It’s one  dawn after another.”Darren Cunningham, looking across the water to where Co Louth is starting to feel very far away, says: “A lot of people are in complete disbelief and don’t think it’s going to happen.

So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
