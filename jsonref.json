Until now.For the Prince of Wales has given a mouthwatering insight into what sets his taste buds tingling by revealing that his ‘favourite recipe’ is . . . pheasant crumble pie.And the heir to the throne likes eating game birds so much he has ‘invented’ a possible successor to that dish’s place in his affections — a moussaka made with grouse, instead of the usual lamb, which he calls ‘groussaka’.His craving for such culinary creations will be revealed in next Wednesday’s edition of Country Life magazine that he is guest editing to mark his 70th birthday, which falls on that very same day. In it, Charles tells how he owes his fondness for pheasant crumble pie to a friend, saying: ‘I got this recipe from someone I know. It is delicious.’He goes on to say: ‘I invented a grouse one recently, coq au vin with grouse, as well as moussaka with grouse (it doesn’t always have to be lamb), in other words groussaka!’The feature, titled My Favourite Recipe, includes an interview with John Williams, the executive chef at The Ritz in London, and the recipe for pheasant crumble pie, along with photographs of Mr Williams preparing it.

Pheasant. Crumble. Pie. Surely it’s either a crumble or a pie, but it can’t be both?After poaching, you cool and shred the pheasant meat (breasts only), strain and reduce the stock, then spike it with sherry. After making a roux with flour and butter, you use the stock to make a thick white sauce. Then you mix it all together, top with breadcrumbs, cheese and bacon before baking in the oven. It sounds ine! Not having the Ritz kitchens, a palace or a personal chef at my disposal, I decide to make it myself. After all, what could possibly go wrong?So I order a pheasant from C Lidgate, the prestigious West London butchers beloved of royals and Richard Branson, but don’t let that put you off. It comes from Norfolk although not the Sandringham Estate, but that is close enough for me. I poach it as instructed, then boil the stock to reduce.Neither Mr Williams nor Prince Charles mention the scum that gathers on the surface, as is usual when boiling fowl. Perhaps you just can’t have that word in a royal recipe? I skim my scum surreptitiously.The breadcrumbs are an outrageous extravagance, fried in 170g of butter, almost three-quarters of a pack. Even after drying them, they are still a mound of engorged butter bombs. To intensify the decadence, parmesan cheese and crispy bacon are added, before the dish is baked in the oven.So what does it taste like? Really rather delicious, although it is incredibly rich. Savoury, soothing and surprisingly economical, it is exactly the kind of comfort food one might expect the Prince of Wales to adore. White meat only and lashings of dairy, with a crispy topping and a buttery overload all add up to a decadent supper fit for a king-to-be.It is retro nursery food given a touch of luxury — the kind of food that has fuelled the Monarchy for hundreds of years.PHEASANT CRUMBLE PIEFor two people:1 pheasant                                                  £4.95Bacon                                                            70pVegetables \u0026amp herbs                               £2Pack of butter                                           £2(Plus a splash of £10-a-bottle sherry)                                                              Cost £9.65                                                    Houses for sale, properties for sale - Country Life"},{"url":null,"title":"McDonalds chief eats fast food chain TWICE day claims Britain strike Brexit deal","story":"How High Street sandwiches compare to the vilified Big Mac burger from McDonald\u0027s      Not so Happy Meals!

Above, one of the cat mummies at the site - on the edge of the King Userkaf pyramid complex at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara, south of Cairo          An Egyptian archaeologist cleans some of the mummified cats. Egypt has been whipping up publicity for its new historical discoveries in the hopes of reviving a devastated tourism sector still recovering from the turmoil following a 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak          Archaeologists said that cats were used as religious sacrifices in Ancient Egypt over 5,500 years ago. Cats were known as \u0027Mau\u0027 and were later important in Egyptian society and became a symbol of grace. It is believed the ancient Egyptians cared for domesticated cats as long ago as in 3,700BC. Until recent times, it was thought that cats were first domesticated in the country around 1,950BC  Above, left, a wooden gilded cat statue, and right, one made of bronze, which were both discovered at the site          One of the mummified scarabs discovered inside the tomb of Khufu-Imhat at Saqqara          The mummified beetles - the first ever to be found in the area - were among artefacts found in seven tombs discovered over the past six months on the edge of the King Userkaf pyramid complex.

(Above, a statue found at Saqqara)Archaeologists said that cats were also used as religious sacrifices in Ancient Egypt over 5,500 years ago.Cats were known as \u0027Mau\u0027 and were later important in Egyptian society and became a symbol of grace.Two goddesses took the form of cats - Mafdet - a lion-headed goddess of justice and execution, and Bastet - a cat representing fertility and motherhood.As a revered animal, some cats received the same mummification after death as humans and were often dedicated to Bastet.It is thought there were four main reasons for mummifying animals - to be worshipped as manifestations of certain gods, act as offerings to them, provide food in the afterlife and allow beloved pets to live on in the afterlife.                                                     Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Enany said the discovery was made by an Egyptian archaeological mission during excavation work started in April.Three of the tombs had been used for cats, he said, while one of four other sarcophagi discovered at the site belonged to Khufu-Imhat, overseer of the buildings in the royal palace.The tomb dates from the Fifth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom and is unusual because the facade and door are intact, meaning its contents may still be untouched, according to Mohamed Youssef, director of the Saqqara area.Egypt has been whipping up publicity for its new historical discoveries in the hopes of reviving a devastated tourism sector still recovering from the turmoil following a 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. The Fifth Dynasty ruled Egypt from about 2,500BC to 2,350BC - not long after the great pyramid of Giza was built.The tombs lie in a buried ridge that has only partially been uncovered and could offer many more similar discoveries, Waziri said. Of the statues found, those depicting cats were the majority, reflecting the reverence ancient Egyptians showed the felines, whose God Bastet was worshipped. Other statues depicted a lion, a cow and a falcon. Excavations in the area had halted in 2013 before resuming earlier this year.Saqqara served as the necropolis for Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt for more than two millennia.Ancient Egyptians mummified humans to preserve their bodies for the afterlife, while animal mummies were used as religious offerings.Two large scarabs wrapped in linen and in very good condition were found inside a limestone sarcophagus with a vaulted, decorated lid, the antiquities ministry said in a statement.Another collection of scarab mummies was found inside a smaller sarcophagus.\u0027The (mummified) scarab is something really unique. \u0027It is something really a bit rare,\u0027 Waziri said.\u0027A couple of days ago, when we discovered those coffins, they were sealed coffins with drawings of scarabs. I never heard about them before.\u0027Dozens of cat mummies and gilded statues of cats were unearthed, including a bronze statue dedicated to Bastet.The team also found painted wooden cobra and crocodile sarcophagi, a collection of gilded statues depicting animal features, as well as objects including amulets, canopic jars (which were used to store and preserve the viscera of their owner for the afterlife), writing tools and papyri baskets.Egypt\u0027s relics are a draw for foreign visitors and authorities hope new finds can help attract more as a way to help revive tourism hit by the unrest that followed the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.The number of tourists visiting the country rose 54 per cent to 8.3million last year, still well below the 14.7million who came in 2010.

However, other sources suggest he was married to Queen Khentkaus.It was under his reign that the cult of Ra, the Sun God, started to gain importance.He built the first of a series of temples to Ra at Abu Sir, north of present-day Cairo, on the west bank of the Nile. Userkaf built his pyramid circa 2490 BC in the shadows of Djoser\u0027s Step Pyramid - an archaeological jewel in the Saqqara necropolis built around 2700BC for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser.The pyramid complex of Userkaf consisted of an outer casing of fine limestone, around a core which at some point crumbled into rubble.For this reason, it is known locally as El-Haram el-Maharbish, the \u0027Heap of Stone\u0027.Userkaf\u0027s pyramid forms just part of a larger mortuary complex, which includes an offering chapel and mortuary temple.

There are many causes for infertility and just as there are different causes, so there should be different treatments.Each couple requires the most suitable, cost-effective and safe treatment depending on the cause for their failure to conceive. Increasingly, they are offered the treatment most convenient to the doctor.IVF – the most complex, expensive and demanding of all infertility therapies – is seen as the standard procedure. It is the treatment suggested before the specific cause of the infertility is investigated.          IVF clinical fertility expert Robert Winston, above, writes: \u0027While the desperation of vulnerable patients is a fertile commercial opportunity, it may not improve their chance of a baby\u0027There is no other medical therapy where treatment is offered before proper attempts at diagnosis are made. Such practice is seen as highly unethical and is likely to be found legally negligent.To make matters worse, because each cycle of IVF has such a high failure rate, there are many empty-handed women left distressed after their IVF has failed. They often find themselves confronted by a doctor trying to consider how their IVF treatment might be improved.Without the underlying cause of failure properly established, they are encouraged to buy one of many add-on treatments which mostly have little or no serious evidence for their effectiveness.Nearly all, for different reasons, add substantially to the costs that a couple has already incurred.  \u0027Looking to transfer before Christmas\u0027: Brooklyn actress,...Thousands of young women battling cancer given fresh...Share this articleInitial reports from Israel suggested improved pregnancy rates, for reasons which are still unclear. More recently, Israeli scientists published conclusions suggesting no benefit. Now, 25 years since scratching was introduced, scientists from Utrecht in the Netherlands have initiated a huge randomised trial.So far, the evidence is dubious. Yet, according to a recent publication, up to 83 per cent of patients in New Zealand, Australia and the UK are advised to have the scratch.Embryo glue is also advocated by some clinics to help the embryo stick to the uterus after it is transferred. It involves dipping the embryo into a special fluid which may interact with the womb lining – and some clinics in London only charge £250 for it. The problem is that it probably doesn’t work and there are no definitive randomised trials which show otherwise.There are also a variety of complex treatments offered which are meant to change a patient’s immune system so an embryo is less likely to be rejected after transfer.The treatments add several hundred pounds at least to the cost of IVF. There are expensive tests on ‘killer cells’ in blood taken from the patient’s arm, but it is doubtful whether this gives seriously useful information about what is happening in the uterus.

Discounting so early in the festive season means clothing chains are forced to cut prices on goods they might otherwise have sold at full price in the run-up to Christmas. By contrast, retailers that sell big ticket items such as TVs feel they are able to tempt shoppers to part with cash for expensive items at a time when they have more money in their wallets.So while Amazon and Currys PC World, Argos and AO.com will take part in Black Friday this year, clothing retailers such as M\u0026ampS and House of Fraser are scaling back.Marks \u0026amp Spencer boss Steve Rowe said: ‘We will not engage in discounting for Black Friday.

Customers order 15 things on a discount then send 14 of them back. The delivery networks are in chaos so customers complain when it doesn’t turn up on time.‘Then warehouses are clogged up with all the returns and customers complain when they don’t get the refunds straightaway.

She also joined the Royal Academy of Music’s Junior Department and gained grade eight distinctions in viola, violin and piano.When I was 11, I went to Chetham’s School of Music, which was hard for Ling Ling as she was desperate to go to a specialist music school. Her parents were unsure because she showed such academic potential.  However, she was extremely persuasive and the following year she went to the Purcell School of Music.Worryingly she’d recently become anorexic but it was managed well, and although everyone was concerned, I never thought that this was anything other than a blip. I really wish I’d reached out to her more as she was showing a vulnerability that eventually led her into the wrong group of friends.I remember that we were messaging each other after our maths GCSE.

Priory made £62.2 million last yearTwo giant US healthcare companies, a global private equity group and a Guernsey-based hedge fund have joined two British firms and a major charity operating in the sector and are giving their bosses massive pay packages.They are expanding operations despite Government pledges to move people with autism and learning disabilities out of secure units and into the community after a series of abuse scandals.\u0027Soon it will be me next to Harry and Megssy will be gone\u0027:...Robbie Williams gets the underground pool he craved… by...Share this articleFurious families says they are ‘profiteering from misery’ and Labour is demanding an urgent statement from Health Secretary Matt Hancock after an investigation by this newspaper found half-a-million-pound pay packages and profit margins as high as 31 per cent. ‘It’s nothing short of a national scandal that private companies are being allowed to hive off millions of pounds of NHS money to detain people with learning disability and autism, some in such monstrous conditions,’ said Barbara Keeley, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Mental Health and Social Care.Two weeks ago, we exposed how hundreds of people with autism and learning disabilities are being routinely abused in some facilities, confined in horrific seclusion cells, fed through hatches like animals, aggressively restrained and forcibly drugged.          £39,528,000 said to have been made in a single year by Alan Miller boss of US giant Universal Health Services. Its UK operations are run by Cygnet Healthcare, whose best-paid director earned £508,000, a healthy £162,000 rise on the previous yearThe revelations led Mr Hancock to order an urgent inquiry into the use of segregation and long-term seclusion. The Equality and Human Rights Commission warned the NHS could face a formal investigation for human rights abuses of vulnerable people. Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that firms in this sector include:An American healthcare giant whose boss earned £39.5 million in one year, despite his firm facing allegations of fraud and ‘preying’ on vulnerable people to boost profits in secure unitsAnother huge US firm that handed five executives almost £15 million last year and has been snapping up British operators, including the Priory Group, famous for also treating celebritiesA controversial British company that paid one director more than £1 million over two years despite claims that their staff failed to stop patients self-harming, with one patient later dying, and allegations of a sex assault in a hospitalGroups controlling firms that run a secure unit in Norfolk which are owned by two families who pocketed £2,261,782 in pay and idends over the past yearAnother British firm, backed by private equity and formed only 23 months ago, which runs 55 units and turns over £176 million, with 31.4 per cent profit marginsA charity that is Britain’s biggest provider of specialist psychiatric care that gave its departed chief executive nearly £1 million over the past two years, despite being at the centre of claims that it fed teenagers in solitary confinement through hatches.Angry families complain their children are seen as ‘cash cows’ and are milked by private providers that can charge the NHS more than £14,000 a week and whose own staff help make decisions on sectioning people under mental health laws.‘It’s an outrage given the numerous cases of neglect, abuse and deaths of vulnerable people in their care,’ said Isabelle Garnett, an autism activist whose teenage son suffered badly during two years detained in secure units.This newspaper has revealed families are having teenagers and young adults with autism and learning disabilities taken away and stuck in supposedly short-stay ATUs and secure units for many years.          £1,059,000 given over two years to the highest-paid director at Huntercombe. The chief executive is Valerie Michie, above. Huntercombe is owned by a Guernsey hedge fund and provides 91 beds for people with autism and learning disabilitiesDarren Slater, who has autism and learning disabilities, has been held for 17 years, despite having his own house bought with NHS compensation for a birth mistake. ‘There is a lot of money being made out of all this,’ said his father Brian.Another mother said she was forced to feed sweets to her teenage son with autism through metal bars after seeing him transported between secure units in a cage in a van. ‘I was so angry but so powerless,’ said Julie Newcombe, whose son is now free. She set up Rightful Lives with others to expose human rights abuses. ‘How can the Government waste millions imprisoning children and tell families there is no money for support at home?‘There is a huge conflict of interest within the private sector because heads on beds equals money in the bank, which means profit becomes the ultimate barrier to discharge.’The NHS spent £477.4 million in 2016 on people with autism and learning disabilities just in ATUs, which are meant to assess and treat psychiatric needs, rather than resolve care shortfalls. Instead, people are becoming trapped, often from adolescence, in an abusive, medicated and stressful system that can make conditions worse.                             The NHS spent £477.4 million in 2016 on people with autism and learning disabilities just in ATUs, which are meant to assess and treat psychiatric needs, rather than resolve care shortfalls                        Ministers have promised repeatedly since the 2011 Winterbourne View abuse scandal to move such people out of unsuitable secure units and into community care. Many units rely on carers paid only marginally above minimum wage levels. Yet the number of adults with autism and learning disabilities locked up in ATUs fell only slightly over the past three years, while the number of children more than doubled. Last year, there were 28,880 restraint incidents in England alone.One reliable source confirmed he had seen confidential data showing a health body paying average rates in 2016 of £2,007 per person a day.Over the past decade, the proportion in privately-run beds has soared from one-fifth to more than half, as new players such as Acadia, a Tennessee-based healthcare group, moved into the profitable trade in vulnerable people.Acadia spent £1.3 billion on the Priory Group two years ago. It now has 61 hospitals in Britain – ten holding people with autism and learning disabilities in secure units and three ATUs – among its 586 facilities and 18,000 psychiatric beds worldwide. Chief executive Joey Jacobs was reported to have earned £7.5 million last year alone in salary, bonuses and stock.One mother I spoke to was close to tears over treatment of her child in a Welsh unit run by Priory. ‘I’m fighting for her life,’ said Gillian Mead, whose daughter Lee, 43, was sectioned for the first time in April and claims to have been often restrained. ‘Lee has lost about five stone, and says “I want to come home” all the time. It’s awful.’          £362,000 collected by the highest-paid director at sector newcomers Elysium Healthcare last year. The chief executive is Joy Chamberlain, above. Elysium is backed by BC Partners, a private equity group, through low-tax Luxembourg, and operates in 55 UK locationsLast year, the Priory Group made £62.2 million profit, with most revenues funded by taxpayers. It handed one director £243,000 in remuneration. ‘The number of people with learning disabilities and autism placed in our secure hospitals by NHS England amounts to just two per cent of Priory Group beds and this number is falling,’ said a spokesman. He added that patient safety and family engagement were a priority and that all units were subject to regular official inspections.Universal Health Services is another huge US healthcare firm snapping up British psychiatric services. In June, it bought the Danshell Group, specialising in autism and learning disabilities at its 25 facilities. Universal’s founder is Alan Miller, reportedly the richest chief executive in the hospital industry – in 2016 he collected more than £39 million in pay, bonuses and stock. Yet in 2016, a year-long Buzzfeed investigation in nine US states accused the firm of pressuring staff to fill beds in hospitals for financial gain, even by falsely making patients appear suicidal.The claims were strongly disputed by the firm.Its British operations are run by Cygnet Healthcare, which boasted in recent accounts of earning revenues from 220 NHS purchasing bodies – a rise of 44 in a year – and almost doubling income as profits surged to £40.4 million.The fast-expanding firm gave its highest paid director a £508,000 pay package, a £162,000 increase on the previous year. Yet at one unit, staff injected patients in face-down restraints with medication, against official guidance. A secure unit in Woking was put in special measures after 24 serious incidents in a children’s ward, including sexual assault and staff failures to stop ‘significant’ self-harm including cutting and ligature-tying.          £2,262,000 pay and idends collected last year by two families from groups owning firms running a secure unit in Norfolk, and headed by chief executive Tugay Akman, above. The father of one man with autism there claims his son often sleeps 15 hours a day due to over-sedationA Cygnet spokesman said the Woking unit was now judged ‘good’ with safe care, while the firm was making ‘significant investments’ to ensure people with autism were treated in non-hospital environments if possible.British firms include Huntercombe, which ran the ATU – since closed – in which one young woman was fed so much in seclusion that she died from obesity in 2013. The firm handed its highest-paid director £1,059,000 over the past two years – it is not known if this is chief executive Valerie Michie.Huntercombe runs ten hospitals, of which three units with 91 beds focus on patients with autism and learning disabilities.An inspection earlier this year into one of them, the 40-bed Cedar House in Kent, found services and safety ‘required improvement’. Serious incidents registered included three cases of patients swallowing batteries, two other cases of self-harm and an allegation of sexual assault, plus use of ‘heavily soiled’ bed linen. One man also died in hospital after sticking batteries up his nose.          Tony Hickmott has been locked up for almost 18 years at Cedar House, a 40-bed secure unit near Canterbury owned by Huntercombe                                                    "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/10/00/04E87C1E000005DC-0-image-a-76_1541811197045.jpg","title":"FTSE100 chief execs called Dave Steve outnumber women run Britains businesses","story":"Daves and women were actually level pegging until last week when the housebuilder Persimmon announced its chief executive, Jeff Fairburn was being temporarily replaced by managing director Dave Jenkinson (left).  Right, Tesco boss Dave Lewis      Stephen Hester of RSA Insurance Group and, right, Stephen Carter, boss at Informa          There are just six female chief executives in the 100 firms, compared to seven men called Steve or Stephen and seven Daves or Davids.

They have tremendous loyalty to both parents and learn early on to navigate between the two camps.They hate to hear their parents slagging off each other and generally decide that total discretion is the wisest modus vivendi – rarely telling one parent anything about their time with the other.I remember freaking out when I learnt, through a third party, that my son Sam, then six years old, had slept in his father’s Majorcan bar during his stay with him. But Sam never mentioned it to me, nor seemed particularly put out when I raised the topic.Children are very accepting of each parent’s character and, as they grow up, instinctively understand their respective strengths and weaknesses.There have been countless times when, annoyed as I may have been with my ex, I have known that he would have a better take than me on one of our child’s worries. At moments like this, shared responsibility is a relief.Divorced parenting is never easy but the best thing you can do for your kids is to try to ensure they have an equally strong relationship with both parents.

I know we were using the heater,” recalls Raad, a Syrian who was 24 when the war started in his home. Kugler later drew a picture of Raad just as he had found him, sitting on the floor beside the heater and a pile of plastic cups, his green eyes leaping from the image.Now the striking drawing forms part of an exhibition opening this weekend in London, and Raad is there to see it in person. Later that year, after more than 300 failed attempts, Raad managed to reach the UK by hiding in a suitcase in the luggage hold of a bus. Last week, as the two men were reunited for the start of the art show, Kugler joked he could tell it was Raad by the green eyes smiling out at him from under a baseball cap. “I recognised you in spite of the new beard,” said the artist.The acclaimed images of refugees that Kugler made later – based on their conversations and on the photographs he takes of the refugees’ long journeys from Syria across Europe – will form a key part of the exhibition now on at the House of Illustration in King’s Cross.Journeys Drawn: Illustration from the Refugee Crisis, features 40 works from a dozen artists, including three refugees and the  reporter Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, and reflects the contrasting moods of migrant existence.When war broke out Raad was a student living in al-Qusayr, a city of around 100,000 inhabitants just outside Homs. There is nothing there now, Raad says, and he has no desire to see it again. “It has been empty since 2013. My father went there two days ago because the new mayor wants to rebuild the city and he wants to make a park. My father said there is nothing there now.”Now, as a 31-year-old student of international relations at London politan University and with an improving grip on the language, Raad is beginning to feel at home. “I have started thinking in English in the last few weeks,” he said. “I don’t call my mum that often and I found I started to text her in English. And I am even dreaming in English now. I never used to dream at all.”The two friends he shared his small shelter with in France are now both in Britain: one in Cardiff and one in Portsmouth. “I know one of them paid a smuggler a lot of money to get here, the other one too probably.” Raad rarely speaks to them.“I don’t speak to many Syrians now actually,” he adds.Kugler, whose award-winning cartoons depict the words and sights of refugee life, remembers how difficult it was to find someone to interview in the Calais migrant camp. “It was very hard to speak to people, compared with when I was with travelling with Médecins Sans Frontières, the charity, and had translators. I had the impression people in the camp weren’t very interested in talking to me.”When he knocked on the shack door back then, he thinks he was told to come back later because the men inside were asleep. “We had to try to get to Britain during the night. There was only a chance when it was dark,” Raad explains. “We were really tired and we wanted to tidy up a bit too.”“In fact, we enjoyed talking later,” said Raad. “When you are in the camp it is very boring and you want to talk to new people. It is a connection with the world out there.”Raad’s own final journey to Britain eventually came after 11 months spent at the Calais encampment. When he travelled to see a friend in Paris, he spotted a bus service to England and hatched the plan to hide himself in the hold. Amazingly, it worked on only the second attempt.“The first time the bag broke. But the next time I stayed curled up for nine hours. I could breathe because I could open the case a little. Normally no one gets in like that because they have dogs checking every bag. I was just lucky. It was raining and it wasn’t a time when many trains were going through.”When Raad arrived he was sent to Cardiff first, where he enrolled for English courses. A period of sickness followed. Raad said he was in bed for a month and he believes the repeated exposure to tear-gas attacks and the bad conditions in the camp took a belated toll on his health. He lost hair and his breathing has been affected.When his papers confirming his status as a refugee came through, he moved to London. He chose England because his twin brother, Emad, was already living in Newcastle, and he chose to study international relations because of an early love of the maps and atlases his father used to give him to look at and his interest in the history of different countries. Although Kugler does use photography initially, the work of illustrators is particular suited to refugee coverage, according to Katie Nairne, the House of Illustration’s curator, because they can spend longer periods of time observing their subjects in situations where photography may be banned, or seem intrusive.“The work illustrators have created in response to, or as a result of, the personal experiences of refugees has been vital in telling the stories of those who must leave their homes to seek safety,” said Nairne.Also in the show is Iranian artist Majid Adin’s award-winning animation for Elton John’s Rocket Man, which draws on his own journey to Britain. Adin was imprisoned in Iran for his political works and then smuggled to London inside a refrigerator. Palestinian-Syrian Mahmoud Salameh’s cartoons were inspired by 17 months spent in an Australian detention centre, while British Libyan Asia Alfasi’s manga work explores some of the issues refugees face.Kugler’s digital portrait of Raad in Calais hangs next to his work showing refugees arriving on the Greek island of Kos and near to the graphic novel made by Kate Evans to recount her experience of volunteering in the Calais camp.Journeys Drawn: Illustration from the Refugee Crisis is at the House of Illustration, King’s Cross, London, until March 24 houseofillustration.org.uk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e61807e6d159cb0f5fb89e39795326d4287da03/17_1102_1747_1048/master/1747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2161c25b23a9b18a1ee7ac1bf7078ec3","title":"japanese kabuki prints in pictures","story":"Kabuki is a form of traditional Japanese theatre that was hugely popular from the 1600s to the 1800s.

She is the author of seven novels, seven short story collections and three works of nonfiction. Born in Dundee in 1965, she has lived in Glasgow and London, but has now settled in Essex. She has appeared twice in the Granta best young British novelist list and in 2007 won the Costa Book of the Year award for her novel Day. In the last couple of years she has published stories for children. Her latest book, The Little Snake (Canongate, £9.99), is a novella written to mark the 75th anniversary of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s The Little Prince.What was it like to return to Saint-Exupéry’s much-loved classic?If you read The Little Prince as a grownup it is pretty bloody sad. You think: “Oh shit, it’s about death.” There’s a funny snake and a snake that kills him. So I thought, I’ll do the snake because I quite like snakes.Did you intend it to be for both children and adults?It’s for very young people up to old people. I don’t have any children, but it is all the things I would have wanted to say to a child, without completely burdening it and screwing it up. In Germany, the woman who is my German “voice”, whose husband has died, said she was going to buy it for her young daughter. I don’t want there to be children with bereaved parents, but there are and maybe it’s a way of talking about that.It is, in part, a refugee story. The references to kite flying from rooftops, rose gardens and the beautiful decorative cover design suggest a Middle Eastern country. But the human characters are called Mary and Paul. Is it set in a real place?No, it’s not set anywhere. The Land of Perditi doesn’t exist. Lots of places fly kites: it’s a joyful thing children do, a joyful thing adults do. The city is basically London: a once beautiful city that’s falling in half with increasingly empty beautiful towers, possibly containing crocodile pools, as Mary assumes.The Little Prince is a parable about retaining a childlike openness to the world. Apart from his victims at the moment of their deaths, only the children can see your little snake. Is the importance of imagination something that appeals to you?You’ve got to have it. If you can’t imagine a different political situation, you can’t change anything. We couldn’t imagine that the status quo – which was fairly balanced and reasonable and civilised – needs constant maintenance. It does. You can’t empathise if you can’t imagine being somebody other than yourself. So imagination is at the bottom of democracy, at the bottom of civilised behaviour and at the bottom of not behaving like a sociopath.The Little Prince was published in 1943 and in many ways is a response to the crisis facing Saint-Exupéry’s native France. It was also a comment on 20th-century greed and consumerism. Did this give it added resonance, rewriting it today?If you prioritise money over preventing people drowning, starving, catching fire – that can’t go well. We can all be stupid, but if you make a stupid mistake, fix it – don’t repeat it. If everybody in charge is in Putin’s pocket, bought by demagogues or the fossil-fuel lobby, that’s unfortunate in 360 degrees.And yet the ending is, if not hopeful, consoling. Do you feel optimistic?It is all terrible but that’s when you can’t despair. You can maybe despair when everything is wonderful. If you despair now, you’ve surrendered when we need you. Particularly if you are in a relatively comfortable position. So crack on!You’re a standup as well as a writer. You concede to your reputation as a bit of a “miserabilist” on your very funny website. How do you get to be so bleak and so amusing?They are the same thing. They come from absolutely the same place. It’s that decision – are you going to scream or laugh?Saint-Exupéry would start work at 11pm and write through the night. Do you keep similar working hours?Left to my own devices, I would sleep until about 11am, do the admin stuff and emails, and start a little bit of work before dinner. And then get about five good hours in.How would describe yourself as a writer?A freak looking for a circus. Usually.Which books and authors have stayed with you since childhood?I read everything. I still go back to The Hobbit before I start writing a new novel or one of those other classic, communicative books – it’s a kind of good luck thing and a way to remember the reader. And I’m with Ratty – messing about in (very small) boats is the way to be chilled.What books are on your bedside table?Miss Pook et les enfants de la lune by Bertrand Santini – I’m trying to renovate my French.• The Little Snake by AL Kennedy is published by Canongate (£9.99).

But are we confusing readability with literary value? “The fascination of what’s difficult,” wrote WB Yeats, “has dried the sap out of my veins ... ” In the press coverage of this year’s Man Booker prize winner, Anna Burns’s Milkman, we’ve read a good many commentators presenting with sapless veins – but a dismaying lack of any sense that what’s difficult might be fascinating.That’s at least a useful starting point. Appiah defends the idea – which, nearly a century after modernism really kicked off, probably shouldn’t need defending – that ease of consumption isn’t the main criterion by which literary value should be assessed. We like to see sportsmen and women doing difficult things. We tend to recognise in music, film, television and the plastic arts that good stuff often asks for a bit of work from its audience. And we’re all on board with “difficult” material as long as it’s a literary classic – we read The Waste Land for our A-levels and we scratched our heads as we puzzled it out, and now we recognise that it is like it is because it has to be that way. So why is “difficult” a problem when it comes to new fiction?Attacking a literary prize for rewarding a book that doesn’t accord with a critic’s ideas about “readability” is simply philistinism. The question is not where the book sits on some notional sliding scale between “challenging” and “page-turner”: it’s how successfully it answers whatever challenge it sets itself. The question isn’t how difficult a book is, but why it’s difficult. What is it doing with its difficulty? What is it asking of the reader? Does that difficulty reward the reader’s investment of time? You’re entitled, as James Marriott did in the Times, to conclude that in this case the view from the top of Snowdon wasn’t worth the hike. But complaining about the hike per se is to give up on the idea that there might be any case for art that rewards an investment of energy and attention from its consumer.And the way Burns talks about Milkman makes clear that, whether we like it or not, she is doing something with the “difficulty” of the novel. One of the things that has most vexed its critics is the fact that none of the characters has a name. That wasn’t an arbitrary decision. “The book didn’t work with names,” she has said. “It lost power and atmosphere and turned into a lesser – or perhaps just a different – book. In the early days I tried out names a few times, but the book wouldn’t stand for it. The narrative would become heavy and lifeless and refuse to move on until I took them out again.” In other words, it is like it is because it has to be that way.Books can be “difficult” in all sorts of different ways. Late Henry James is difficult in a wholly different way than Finnegans Wake is difficult, and Moby-Dick is difficult in a different way to either of those (mostly because of all that sodding scrimshaw). Sometimes the difficulty is a surface difficulty, to do with vocabulary. A Clockwork Orange, for instance, is a challenge to start with – but once you get the hang of Nadsat, it’s easy as pie. Sometimes it’s a formal difficulty. Alan Hollinghurst’s The Stranger’s Child is written in very clear and easy (though very careful) language but it jumps in time and point of view so that the reader spends the beginning of each section wondering, for a page or two, where and when and who the hell they are. Sometimes, as with Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury, it’s a bit of both. Sometimes it’s a thematic difficulty: Marilynne Robinson asks her readers to engage with theology as well as psychology Chris Kraus’s I Love Dick has a literary-theoretical element. The Great Gatsby is easy-difficult: it presents the reader with no problem paragraph by paragraph, but to appreciate its thematic architecture takes steady attention.Nicola Barker, a novelist who is herself from time to time accused of being difficult, says: “I see fiction as being ided into two categories. Work that confirms and celebrates and panders and work that confounds and perplexes and challenges. My work challenges – as I’m sure Anna Burns’s does – but this is because we are trying to understand and engage with ideas, emotions and a world that aren’t straightforward or coherent or manageable. Sometimes the form or style of a book needs to mirror the complexity of life. Sometimes we need to try and describe the indescribable. Life is hard and paradoxical. It isn’t always easy. Nor should all fiction be.”She adds that, since experimental writers don’t make much money and don’t attract much glamour, “it’s doubly strange that we get so much stick for trying to innovate and challenge and experiment. Experimental fiction is something you write for the love of it. It is rarefied. But it is important because it often forms the foundation of our creative ecosystem. Other artists (musicians, painters, architects etc) higher up the food chain read us and engage with our ideas and translate what we do.”This year, as every year, there have been versions of the old op-ed standby that the Man Booker is succumbing to pretension or political correctness or snobbery or irrelevance. These all make for pleasingly attitudinal headlines but they ignore the glaring point that every single year you get a whole new panel of judges who make a whole new determination from a whole new batch of books. And the complaint that a particular winner “won’t sell” – another gripe levelled at Burns, as it was at last year’s winner, George Saunders – is also beside the point. Boosting book sales is the happy outcome and, in a way, the purpose of these prizes: but to imply that it’s therefore the judges’ job to choose the book most likely to get the biggest sales uplift from the prize is to let the tail wag the dog.“You want the book to go round the world,” says Gaby Wood, the Man Booker’s literary director. “You want it to reach people. But you can’t work with a patronising idea that normal people won’t be able to understand this. I put the question to a previous panel: ‘Are you trying to reward the book that pushes literature forward the most or are you wanting to select the book that you most want to push into the hands of people all round the world?’ The difficulty comes when, for a panel, the answers to those questions are different books. That has happened, and it can be agonising. This year though, Anna Burns was felt to be the answer to both.”Easy good books will, with a bit of luck, find their audiences easy bad books will do so too, because they are often fun in spite of or because of their badness. Difficult bad books will tend to die in a ditch and difficult good books, without a helping hand, are likely to do so too. Think of prizes like the Folio, Man Booker and next week’s Goldsmiths as that helping hand. Having a panel of serious and thoughtful critics giving a lot of time to noticing something that might otherwise not be widely noticed can’t, surely, be a bad thing. These prizes are set up to reward the best literary fiction. Here, though, something of a definitional abyss opens. What the hell is “literary fiction”?I’ve heard it said, and it’s an attractive position, that “literary fiction needs to recognise that it’s just another genre and get over itself”. Fair enough. Let’s explore that. I think it’s a pious cop-out to declare, as some do: “There aren’t literary books and popular books: there are just good books and bad books.” If we’re going wilfully to retreat from analysis, we may as well fold our tents as critics. There are indeed good and bad books but books also succeed and fail – and are responded to by readers – in relation to the genres they fit into or escape from.Like it or not, literary fiction is a category that we use. And if it is just another genre and needs to get over itself, fine. Let’s work with that. We can identify features of other genres. Aliens and nanobots? SF, more often than not. Guns and hats and dead bodies? Crime. Dossiers and dead drops? Spy novels. So we ought to be able to make some, if necessarily vague, stabs at identifying what the features of “literary fiction” are. Let’s leave aside cultural value judgments about “importance” or “seriousness”. Literary fiction can, like most fiction, be unimportant. It can also be unserious: some of the best of it is. I’d call Italo Calvino’s If on a Winter’s Night a Traveller literary fiction, but it doesn’t strike me as either important or serious. It’s a glorious game.It’s sometimes fuzzily said that literary fiction gives you more on rereading, or that it stays with you, or that it’s “more profound”. That may be true, some of the time – but these things are more likely to be symptoms than necessary features. I’d suggest that the main identifying feature – and in this respect literary writing can and does compass and mingle with any number of other genres – is to do with complexity and depth of attention. That can be moral or psychological complexity – crudely, the goodies and baddies are less clearly delineated – but it can also be, and tends to be in the best work, allied to a greater attention to the form and to the sentence-by-sentence language itself. And where I say that it mingles with other genres, the point I mean to make is that (just like hats, or nanobots) its features can be found in any genre. You could make the case that Iain M Banks’s Culture novels are literary SF, that Sarah Waters has written literary historical thrillers, that Joseph Kanon or John le Carré write literary spy novels, that the metafictional quality of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a literary quality, and so on. The examples are numberless.A publishing acquaintance suggests an analogy with music: jazz is more complex than blues. It’s harder to play and harder to appreciate. That doesn’t mean there isn’t lots of good blues and lots of bad jazz. It doesn’t mean that jazz is an innately superior artform. It simply describes a formal difference between the two. Likewise, when we talk about a “literary novel” we usually mean something that demands and rewards close attention – though, as ever, there will be exceptions. The quality of that attention isn’t uniform from novel to novel. You don’t, for instance, read the torrential riffings of a Thomas Pynchon or even a Karl Ove Knausgaard the same way as you do the crystalline exactness of Nabokov. And those qualities will, for reasons that should be obvious, sometimes but not always issue in “difficulty”.If plot is the main engine of the reader’s attention, the author will often (but not always) write in a way that’s designed to draw the reader effortlessly from page to page: windowpane prose, clear and quick. If the author is doing something else, or something as well, they may want to slow you down. They may be interested in a voice, or an atmosphere, or (as modernists and postmodernists are) in jiggering with the form of the novel itself. There’s a decent literary-theoretical argument for formal jinxiness, too. Naturalist fiction presents one account of the world – and it lulls you into the idea that it’s the only one. Marxist critics have made the fair point that a genre frames an account of reality: 19th-century bourgeois realism, say, presents in its very conventions a worldview. It selects – from its subject matter and setting to its forms of narration – a way of seeing things that implicitly normalises them. If the core of your novel is whether the well-off young white people on the plantation fall in love, the social set-up in which they are embedded takes a back seat in the reader’s consideration. Or to take a non-political example, Kurt Vonnegut remarked that he hated to put love stories into his novels because: “If a lover in a story wins his true love, that’s the end of the tale, even if World War III is about to begin, and the sky is black with flying saucers.”So the form of a narrative is a political (or phenomenological) decision rather than a natural state of the order of things. The free indirect style, the omniscient narrator, the stream of consciousness, or whatever your means of telling: all are profoundly artificial and historically determined, and a writer is quite within his or her rights to mix that up a bit – to draw attention to its artificiality, or to explore ways of complicating the reader’s engagement with his or her imaginative world. The novelist and critic Gabriel Josipovici, in What Ever Happened to Modernism?, tends to argue (if I read him right) that it’s not so much a right as a duty.But formal self-consciousness or narrative tricksiness aren’t, in themselves, difficult. Some bestselling literary writers – Ian McEwan, for instance – are full of metafictional touches, embedding books within books and playing around with unreliable narrators. Most people would see Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five as a work of literary SF – and it jumps around wildly but it’s not a difficult book (I don’t think) to read. And David Mitchell – as radio-friendly a unit-shifter as literary fiction now has – is forever playing with structure and voice. Cloud Atlas, which was what really put him on the map, is a polyphonic novel of multiple genres structured like a Russian matryoshka doll. Yet as Mitchell says, he feels giving pleasure is part of his contract with the reader – a courtesy if you’re asking them to invest the several hours they will spend reading your book.So let’s not assume that challenging work is like some sort of joyless high-fibre diet. Many if not most of the great modernists and postmodernists weren’t just formally challenging: they were outright funny. Samuel Beckett, laureate as he was of existential despair, is wildly funny. So is James Joyce. So, in his pinstriped way, is TS Eliot. More recently, David Foster Wallace is almost dementedly prankish, as is Pynchon. AL Kennedy’s Costa-winning Day, about bomber pilots in the second world war, is a book of high seriousness and some narrative complexity, but is full of jokes. Tom McCarthy’s Satin Island contains, for my money, the funniest gag on that year’s Booker shortlist. And it’s notable that many of those who have enjoyed Milkman commend it not for being solemn or profound but for being funny.All this is not to say that some difficult novels are not truly ghastly. If hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue, you could say that pretentiousness is the tribute that mediocrity pays to genius. I remember a colleague on a judging panel surveying the gathered novels and saying, with a certain roll of the eyes: “There’s a lot of ... fine writing in here.” By this he meant overwrought bad writing. The idea of literary fiction – in particular the idea that it is intrinsically high-status or, worse, “important” – is the rock on which many ambitious second-rate writers bark their shins. It’s what gives us plotless novels choked with portentous metaphors and pseudo-profound ruminations, novels that mistake difficulty for accomplishment or, worse, solemnity for seriousness. It’s what gives us, in parody, the “octuple time scheme and sixteen unreliable narrators” of Richard Tull’s unreadable seventh novel in Martin Amis’s The Information. Just because literary fiction doesn’t necessarily tell a story (though it usually at some level does), and frequently spars with its own form, and tends to pay attention to its language, it doesn’t mean that by turning all those things up to 11 you’ve created a worthwhile work of art. And it’s for just that reason that, year by year, we should be grateful rather than indignant that panels of judges on literary prizes labour to bring to our attention those difficult books that really are worth our time.The Waves by Virginia WoolfWoolf set out to “record the atoms as they fall upon the mind” and The Waves is an experiment in doing this without the usual narrative scaffolding. The lives of six characters are told through their revolving thoughts. This can feel hard to navigate, but if you persevere there’s an intense sensory world to be discovered.The Golden Bowl by Henry JamesJames is notorious for his complicatedly meandering sentences and this late novel takes it to a new level. It’s not only the prose that’s difficult, the plot itself becomes more about what characters know about each other than what they are actually doing. It’s the ultimate novel for people interested in charting every nuance and detail of human relationships.Beloved by Toni MorrisonThe legacies of slavery and their intersections with patriarchy might seem subjects too difficult for scrupulous novelistic treatment. Morrison’s book throws the discoveries of high modernist style and the fiery drives of gothic horror at the task and creates something uniquely unsettling and appallingly convincing. Beloved makes readers suffer, but our suffering enlarges our world.The Unconsoled by Kazuo IshiguroIshiguro’s Booker prize-winning The Remains of the Day exemplified the user friendly literary novel for a generation of readers. He followed it with a book so intricate and sly that it feels like the cleverest revenge he could have wreaked on himself and his readers for that earlier triumph.Tristram Shandy by Laurence SterneThis takes nothing for granted about what a novel is meant to be. Ostensibly the autobiography of the narrator, it piles digression on digression and plays tricks with readers’ expectations. But Sterne’s love of life and his commitment to his characters’ psychic curlicues animate every page. Difficulty has never been so much fun.Ulysses by James JoyceJoyce’s extravagant cartography of a single day in Dublin makes every possible demand on the reader, from secret mythical references to diffuse exploration of streams of consciousness. Ulysses made difficulty central to the modernist aesthetic, but Joyce also delights in the baseness of the flesh and is unsettlingly funny and mischievous.A Girl Is a Half-formed Thing by Eimear McBrideMcBride’s title tells us not to believe that any way of describing ourselves and our world should be seen as fixed. Her prose takes us inside bodily experience and the inchoate recesses of personal identity in forensic, giddying ways.The Golden Notebook by Doris LessingLessing’s epochal feminist novel is deeply ambivalent about feminism, as it is about everything else, including its own structure. But it also shows how rich and revealing ambivalence itself can be. By structuring the novel as five interwoven notebooks, Lessing sends her characters wheeling through endless different attitudes towards their complex identities.Doctor Faustus by Thomas MannMann’s tale of a composer and his pact with the demonic elements convulsing his own talent and modern German history is a fierce gateway into the grand European modernist landscape. It’s the complexity of his interpretation of history and culture that makes the novel so compelling.Outline by Rachel CuskCusk follows in the tradition of The Waves in evacuating the novel of what we expect of character and description, instead charting with pin-point coolness the terms of our disconnection from one another. In so doing, the deepest truths that connect people emerge. Cusk’s trilogy has shown how many new types of difficulty we still need and enjoy in the 21st century.• Lara Feigel is the author of Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing (Bloomsbury)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bcad23f7597ef74119c0950246de458d4030531/0_52_3660_2197/master/3660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d8b0c4e158be544ab2d5b143621242d","title":"centenary of the armistice cartoon","story":"David Simonds on the tributes marking the anniversary of the end of the first world war"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d227ad6319e5d898469c45c8a0dbb8f68e37b9/0_128_3760_2256/master/3760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=457bdc5a15672502ad505ba0593a3eaa","title":"the lowdown on british columbia this canadian province is not to be missed","story":"With cosmopolitan cities nudging wide-open wilderness, spectacular wildlife and a superb culinary scene, British Columbia offers a host of amazing adventuresChefs around the world adore BC for its incredible produce, from sweet spot prawns, celebrated in a festival each year at Vancouver’s Fisherman’s Wharf, to the juicy Okanagan cherries and peaches, which locals devour by the crate.Start planning your trip by poring over online menus at stellar Vancouver restaurants such as chef Andrea Carlson’s Burdock \u0026amp Co Gastown go-to, French-influenced L’Abattoir or the upmarket west coast take at Botanist.

Check out kitsch memorabilia, clothing with Chinese motifs, and Hong Kong-made backpacks In the narrow, lantern-filled streets of Central and Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) – under looming mirrored skyscrapers and a hot tropical sun – Hong Kong becomes a city dedicated to eating and shopping. Visitors on a consumption high lurch from buzzing dim sum restaurants to bustling markets, gorging on truffle wontons and debating exactly how often they’d use a 10-part porcelain tea set back home. Of the hundreds of Cantonese restaurants, aromatic medicine shops and colourful boutiques stocked with local goods that line the city’s streets, the following examples in particular capture the essence of Hong Kong with aplomb.Ho Lee Fook Directly translating as “good fortune in your mouth” in English, the name of this colourful Cantonese restaurant sounds a lot like the exclamation diners make after tasting the tender roast wagyu short ribs with soy glaze, the Taiwanese chicken or the threadfin fish with Jamaican-Chinese jerk rub. The Hong Kong theme is strong throughout – think a giant shimmering bronze dragon covering one wall, while the steps leading down to the restaurant are lined with hundreds of golden toy cats raising a single paw in salute. It’s no reservations, so avoid prime time – or factor in a few strong cocktails at the bar while you wait.Jimmy’s KitchenIf only walls could talk. Jimmy’s Kitchen has been around since 1928 and has been serving western food to celebrities, politicians and particularly homesick expats for nearly a century. Today, this icon from the colonial era is packed every night with locals who come to immerse themselves in the nostalgic decor and delightfully old-fashioned attitude to food. Popular with megastars like Cary Grant and John Wayne back in the day, its menu has barely been updated since the 1950s – think steak and kidney pie and baked pork knuckle. And it is hard to imagine anywhere else in Asia where you can wallow in the past and order a steak diane, a baked alaska and white Russian for dinner.Goods of Desire With quirky bed linen, novelty stationery and posters big enough to jazz up entire rooms, Goods of Desire has been the go-to store for cool furniture and lifestyle items with a Hong Kong sense of humour since the days of the British. Launched by two architects aiming to repackage Hong Kong heritage brands into kitsch furniture, fun fashion, and quirky art for the younger generation, it has also been deliberately provocative over the years, with a number of slogans aimed at the city’s notorious Triad gangs. Today it’s beloved by tourists and the city’s legions of expats, who stock up on Hong Kong memorabilia before they head home. Try the PMQ (Police Married Quarters) branch for its tiny dim sum restaurant and potent drinks list.Vivienne TamShe designed her first womenswear collection in 1993 and over the past two and a half decades, Hong Kong-raised designer Vivienne Tam has become a household name. Today she’s the territory’s most famous fashion export, and has been credited with paving the way for Chinese designers in western fashion capitals. You’ll see why in her seven sleek emporiums that are dotted around the city. They’re filled with collections that highlight what Tam does best: interpret traditional Chinese motifs for an international audience. These include silk dresses covered in jagged mountain and swirling cloud motifs, and mesh skirts plastered in asymmetrical waterfalls.DoughnutTake the MTR at rush hour and you’ll probably have a Doughnut backpack pressed against you at some point during the journey. This hugely popular fashion accessories store was launched by two young designers in 2010. They wanted to create functional, high-quality bags that were made entirely in Hong Kong and fused fashion and functionality. Lightweight, durable and easy to use, they are ideal for big city life.

The movie, tipped by some for Oscars recognition, will be released later this month.According to Dick Schulz, a freelance director who was present and tweeted about the conversation, which was about race in America, Mortensen said: “For instance, no one says ‘nigger’ anymore.”“The movie is amazing,” Schulz wrote, “but at the Q\u0026ampA after Viggo Mortensen just dropped the N-Word and the oxygen immediately left the room.”He added: “I have no idea why this isn’t a big news story. Viggo is wildly talented but that kind of behavior needs to be publicly checked.”Schulz also wrote that “it was one of the weirdest things I’ve ever witnessed”.Other Twitter users who were present at the Q\u0026ampA confirmed the events described in Schulz’s tweets, the Hollywood Reporter said.Mortensen told the Reporter he was making the point that many people casually used the slur in the period in which the movie is set.He also said he had “no right to even imagine the hurt that is caused by hearing the word in any context”, added that he intended to “speak strongly against racism”, and said he was sorry he used the word."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aaa237a9bf61d7224d1a207da7b5f142a929452/0_611_3597_2157/master/3597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05f4fc59356bd82011b2f5cfc02d1bc9","title":"yotam ottolenghis curry recipes","story":"A mild and buttery squash curry, a richly spiced fish dish with lime salsa and my take on korma made with tofu and cauliflowerWe’ve come to use the word ‘curry’ as an umbrella term for almost anything cooked in a spiced sauce.

They are rich, filling and immensely satisfying, and are all best served on rice.This is a wonderfully rich curry based on a delicate balance between the richness of coconut cream and butter and the delicate acidity of tomatoes.1¼ tsp ground ginger½ tbsp ground fenugreek 1 tsp ground coriander8 cardamom pods, shells discarded and seeds removed and crushed in a mortar½ tsp ground allspice½ tbsp smoked paprika⅛th tsp ground cinnamon450g sustainably-sourced hake (or other firm white fish), skinned, pin-boned and cut into 5cm pieces1 tbsp olive oilSalt and black pepper350g small new potatoes (halved if large), skin on3 tbsp unsalted butter2-3 banana shallots, finely chopped (125g net weight)2 small green chillies, finely chopped (deseeded, if you prefer less heat)3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed300g cherry tomatoes1½ tbsp tomato paste220g coconut cream, plus 1 tbsp to serve 500ml fish stockFor the salsa½ cucumber (100g), cut into 1cm dice1 small green chilli, deseeded and finely chopped 1-2 spring onions, finely chopped (15g net weight)3 tbsp lime juice1½ tbsp coriander leaves, finely chopped2 tbsp olive oilPut the first seven ingredients in a large, high-sided saute pan on a medium-high heat, and toast for a minute, until fragrant.

Seasonal pumpkins, sweet potato – or any root vegetable, really – can be used instead of the butternut. The sauce can be made one or two days ahead: just add a splash of water to reheat, because it tends to thicken as it sits.1 medium butternut squash (1kg), cut in half lengthways, deseeded, then cut into 1.5cm skin-on half-moons3½ tbsp olive oilSalt and black pepper1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped 1 large carrot, peeled and cut into ¼cm-thick rounds4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped1½ tsp tomato paste1 tbsp mild curry powder½ tsp garam masala1 small baking potato, peeled, halved and cut into 5mm-thick slices1¾ tbsp soy sauce½ tbsp maple syrup 100g baby spinach1½ tbsp coriander leaves, roughly chopped 1 red chilli, thinly sliced (deseeded, if you prefer less heat)2 tsp black sesame seeds1 lime, cut into 4 wedgesHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)425Fgas 9.

The capacity to fight back, to score late goals and to win games that have seemed lost is undoubtedly a useful one, but it does raise major questions about how Mourinho should approach Sunday’s Manchester derby.Wednesday’s victory at Juventus was the third time in the last six games that United have found a winner in the final five minutes, but it was also the fifth time in those six matches that they had conceded the opening goal of the game. It is as though they need the release of going behind to commit to attack – and this unbalanced squad is far more set up to attack than to defend. At Chelsea, and to a lesser extent against Everton, United suffered when, having secured a lead, they then tried to defend it.That Mourinho finds himself in this situation in his third season at a club is, frankly, preposterous. How, after more than 100 games of Joséfication, can he have a squad still so little in his image, one that does not relish the harness but demands to be set free to run wild and enjoy itself? Football’s soul has become bedraggled recently, pounded on all sides by bags of gold, but it retains a keenly ironic streak.Yet it may be that his squad’s anarchic nature does Mourinho a favour on Sunday. All his instincts will be to kill the game against City, to defend and provoke and block and spoil. This was the path on which he embarked after being overlooked for the Barcelona job in 2008: to be the anti-Barça. If they played with the ball, he would play without it. If they pressed high, he would employ a low block. If they set themselves up as the bearers of light, he, the fallen Lucifer, formed by the kingdom but rejected from it, would embrace the darkness.But that might not be the best way to approach this game, not just because of United’s characteristics but because of City. The 2010 Champions League semi-final second leg is an obvious exception – although Internazionale did lose that game while winning the tie – but Mourinho’s best results against Guardiola sides have tended to come when he has been forced to attack.In the second leg of the Copa del Rey quarter-final in 2011-12, for instance, Mourinho’s Real Madrid found themselves 4-1 down to Guardiola’s Barcelona. With the game essentially gone, they lost their inhibitions, scored twice and found themselves in the final minutes, implausibly, chasing an away-goals victory. In that second half, the popular theory goes, Madrid lost their fear of Barça. They went on to win the league.Closer to home, there was April’s derby at the Etihad, when United overturned a 2-0 deficit to win 3-2. City may have conceded only four times in the league this season, but the goals‑against column is no longer a way of measuring how good a team are defensively. Last season City conceded only 27 goals in the league but they still looked shaky whenever they came up against a side with the technical ability and nerve to play through their press – notably Liverpool and United.Anybody can keep clean sheets if the opposition cannot get the ball: the real test of a defence comes when they actually have to defend. It may be that City are getting better at doing that. At Liverpool last month, Guardiola set his side up in what was in effect a 4-4-2 formation, with David Silva as a second striker, and the two wide men, Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling, charged with protecting the full-backs. Even then, Kyle Walker was restrained in his forward sallies, tucking in at times as a third central defender as Benjamin Mendy pushed on.Would he bother with a similar policy against United? This is where selections become a game of chicken. If United sit deep, they would no doubt be delighted if City are conservative (although that 4-4-2 can be adjusted to the more familiar 4-3-3 easily enough). But what if United, already nine points behind their neighbours, go for broke?What if Mourinho eschews his dogmatic reactivity to become truly pragmatic and does not what ideology dictates but what is most likely to bring a win and attacks, even if that also risks heavy defeat?A sense there is nothing left to lose has perhaps stimulated Mourinho as much as his players. His hand-to-the-ear gesture in Turin may have been ludicrously immature for a man of 55, but it was classic Mourinho, as was his joke afterwards about getting the FA to translate Italian insults directed at him. A spark of fun and mischief seems to have been reignited in him and that perhaps might give him the courage to do as his own side, his opponent, circumstance and precedent would seem to suggest he should do, and attack.What if, amending the familiar Sunday league instruction to pretend it’s 0-0, he tells his players to go out and play as if they are already 2-0 down? What do City do then? How readily can they slip into that more cautious style they adopted at Anfield? City will likely have the majority of the possession but this game may not have the attack-vs‑defence nature of a typical Guardiola‑Mourinho encounter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b9c03017f37cf5ae4abb6e10f1b8b1883dbc9d/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=033fdcb54cea5cd77db99e2bbf13e4bb","title":"have you already finished your christmas shopping","story":"One in five people in the UK get their Christmas present shopping done before December starts.

Colvin was brave, bold, any edge of recklessness blunted by the fact that her work really had achieved what most journalists dream of when they start their career – saving lives by bearing witness.An eye patch, worn since she lost her sight in one eye to a Sri Lankan rocket-propelled grenade in 2001, became her introduction and trademark. She was also known for her quick wit and sharp tongue. When I first moved to Kabul, grappling with the professional and emotional challenge of pivoting from years reporting about China’s rise to covering Afghanistan’s long and tragic war, I both hoped and feared that I would meet her at the Kabul bar where she drank during trips to the country.I suspected she would find me both dull and timid (I barely skirted the margins of wars she covered in their bloodiest intensity), but I never got a chance to find out. Like many others, I overestimated how long her luck would hold.The attack in Homs aimed to silence her and deter other journalists from following in her footsteps, but this autumn, as the brutal civil war staggers towards its 8th year, she has reappeared across screens, in newspapers and on bookshelves.Hollywood biopic A Private War, a serious biography – In Extremis – and a powerful documentary – Under the Wire – have all come out within weeks of each other. Just months earlier, a thinly fictionalised French film was released that also explored her life and work.For a 56-year-old who was hugely respected for her work, but hardly a household name, this reworking of her life is an extraordinary tribute to her legacy.It is perhaps not surprising that the men who ordered her slaughter thought that the loss of another reporter would be treated as no more than a passing tragedy in her homeland America or her adopted home of Britain.But although journalism generally is not well respected, with reporters languishing alongside lawyers and politicians at the bottom of “least trusted professions” lists, there is an enduring fascination with journalists who go to war or sites of disaster – not under orders to fight or provide aid, but as observers.They have proved fodder for art for decades, from the satire of Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop to the tragedy of Cambodian genocide chronicle The Killing Fields to the hit play Chimerica, which had at its heart a journalist covering the Tiananmen Square massacre (although until recently, the protagonists have all been men).Some of this enduring fascination may be respect for and curiosity about courage. Colvin wore her own fears extremely lightly. “Bravery is not being afraid to be afraid,” she once said. But there was no question that she would go where others would not, cross borders, stay on in war zones even as others with impressive track records of their own left.In 1999, when she and two other women chose to stay on in a besieged compound of refugees in East Timor – as diplomats and most other reporters left, afraid of the mob – she could literally claim to have kept men, women and children alive (although she was not given to boasting and left it to others to chronicle her achievements: “Her courage saved 1,500,” read one front-page headline).Westerners have perhaps never been further from the realities of war. With the last generation of second world war survivors and veterans heading into their final decades, and the military now a small professional corps, many Britons do not personally know anyone who has endured the dreary but terrifying daily grind of conflict. Seen through screens, violence is both compelling and insubstantial.For those who get one step closer, it spawns grinning selfies in redundant flak jackets on the margins of conflict, boasts of helicopter rides and stories of relative – but still safe – proximity to death.When violence cannot be escaped or forgotten, it seeps into life in a much more dangerous and destructive way. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its terrible damage is talked about today much more openly than when Colvin began her career and waged her own battle with the illness.Like most stereotypes recycled in good and bad art, this cliche of the damaged hero or, occasionally, heroine provides a convenient dramatic engine for films and television, with traumas often picked over in extreme detail in films about war in particular. Few people who see war first-hand are not altered in some way by the experience, even if they escape an official diagnosis of trauma.Colvin’s life story had an innate drama with obvious appeal in that tradition. Her attraction to extremes of danger and delight, of violence and emotion is reflected in the title of Lindsey Hilsum’s recently published biography, In Extremis.Exceptional in almost everything she did, she saw more violence and brutality than most soldiers, her reporting had huge impact, and she moved in circles most people only read about in the pages of magazines.Her friends stretched from the Kennedys to the editor of British Vogue, via literary, media and cultural celebrities. One early boyfriend was Lucien Carr, the man who Jack Kerouac would describe as the “glue” of the beat generation.Colvin came of age professionally at a time when there was both more confidence in the power of journalism to transform than there is today and a flowering of a more personal, immediate style. She epitomised both.Yet she paid a huge personal price for her work, grappling with alcoholism and PTSD, and her personal life was as volcanic as her professional life was successful.An exploration of Colvin’s life is an exploration of critical questions about humanity and war, the impact of violence, the power and limits of empathy. It means thinking about the role and responsibilities of the media at a time when this is being fiercely disputed.And there is the fact that she is a woman. There is an enduring cultural fascination with women who go to war as soldiers, reporters or medics, curiosity about what draws them to such an overwhelmingly male world and how they manage there.Any woman who has been needled by leading questions after just one trip to a slightly unstable area is aware of this. Colvin knew it intimately and played on it. When her editors asked what had happened to the male reporters as she hunkered down with the refugees in East Timor, she virtually shrugged down the phone. “They just don’t make men like they used to,” she replied.Although often absent from films and books about war, women have been reporting on the front lines for decades. Clare Hollingworth, who worked for the Daily  and died at the age of 105 last year, got one of the biggest scoops of the last century, breaking the news that the second world war was about to start by driving blithely into Germany in a borrowed diplomatic car and observing tanks preparing to attack Poland.Like many female reporters who came after her, Colvin used misogyny to do some of her best work. Where women are seen as powerless, inconsequential, men are often incapable of treating female journalists as real adversaries and give them a relatively free pass.Publicly, Colvin had little time for feminism, quoting famed reporter Martha Gellhorn’s line that “feminists nark me” in one article. Yet in private she was acutely aware of the constant demand that she outshine men to get the same opportunities. She thought a lot about differences between her coverage and that of men who dominated – and still do, although the number of women is increasingly – the trade.One reason her reporting was so powerful is that it eschewed many of the traits tied to the trade’s macho image. She had no interest in military hardware, in picking out guns or helicopters or artillery.She focused instead on what happens when metal hits flesh, the fate of women and children besieged, starved or fleeing. Rather than gathering stories too often dismissed as “soft” from survivors in refugee camps, she took extreme risks to document the horrors at the heart of conflict. “Maybe we feel the need to test ourselves more, to see how much we can take and survive,” she wrote of female journalists.Her best work illuminated the cost of war through the pain of iniduals: a teenager shot dead as she tried to race down a sniper alley for food, the details of her tiny gold earrings, her fist clenched, in the agonies of death, around a handful of earth.The various projects coming out this autumn were driven by people who knew and loved Colvin and wanted to preserve her legacy. Hilsum was a longstanding friend, although she wrote the honest biography Colvin probably would have wanted, not a hagiography.Photographer Paul Conroy was with her when she died, badly injured in the same attack, and swore to tell the story that she died trying to report. The documentary Under the Wire is based on Conroy’s book about that final reporting trip. He was also a consultant on A Private War.In Conroy, a Liverpudlian ex-soldier, she found someone as courageous, committed and funny as her. Their backgrounds and social circles were wildly different, but they became a tight unit at work. The stress of war can tear people apart, but the intensity of facing death and the worst of humanity together can seal powerful relationships.As an admirer of Colvin’s work, and a woman in a trade that could do with more of us, I am thrilled to see her story celebrated, her sacrifices remembered and the story she died trying to tell returned to screens and pages of our newspapers.But I am also a little wary of how, particularly in the film and much of the media coverage, the courageous reporter shades so fast into tragic heroine, with the woman behind both stereotypes sometimes lost along the way. There is no question Colvin struggled with the physical and mental scars of witnessing so much conflict, had an often painful and messy personal life, while her early death was a tragedy.But her life was not a bleak unfurling of misery. Colvin was charismatic, beautiful and funny, she found purpose and meaning in her work and took huge pride in her success and reputation.One line from the biopic in particular struck me as a certain kind of betrayal of the life Colvin chose. “Maybe I would have liked a more normal life. Maybe I just don’t know how,” Rosamund Pike, who plays Colvin, says.By the accounts of all her friends, Colvin was living exactly the life she had chosen for herself. She fled the stultifying normality of her small-town upbringing, driven by huge ambition and carried by her talent into a world of power, glamour and fame. She embraced being the boldest person at a frontline, the most charismatic at a party. Also emphasised in the movie and media coverage is her childlessness. Colvin tried to conceive with both her husbands and certainly wanted a child enough to try IVF. But in life she was far more sanguine than her celluloid counterpart. “She always loved kids, but was very philosophical about the fact that she had led a life that made it very difficult to have them herself,” Hilsum quotes a close friend saying. “She didn’t say she wished she had led her life differently.”The clearest and most rounded picture in the sweep of new releases emerges from Hilsum’s book. Colvin herself, courageous and often tortured, rises again from its pages. She kept a journal for most of her life and that gave Hilsum extraordinary access to the vulnerable woman behind the glamorous exterior.It also catalogues the bravery, sometimes shading into recklessness, which meant she was always one step ahead of everyone else. Her icy calm in situations that would pin most people to the floor in terror, her willingness to take risks, may ultimately have doomed her. But it meant that she reached places that no one else did.It is not all heroism. Both the book and A Private War are surprisingly blunt about the callous calculations of the industry that sends civilians to cover war. They damn the Sunday Times in particular for turning a private compulsion to go further into a modus operandi.“You’re their prize pig,” says a friend on screen. Hilsum is less direct and acknowledges that Colvin was to some degree complicit. She tells us that Colvin wrote about the loss of her eye for the paper before it had even been operated on.Colvin’s bosses knew, Hilsum writes, that “Marie’s risk-taking was getting them the best stories”. Courage made her vulnerable “not just because such reporting put her in danger, but because she and her editors let it define her”.The reason she took those risks and the horrors she tried to expose and combat in her life’s work are brought to life in the documentary Under the Wire in all their gritty, painful clarity, with a force that even the best prose struggles to match.The film seems unrelenting because it covers a short period of horror, but there are glimpses of Marie’s sharp wit, her joy and charm. And it captures the horrors she tried to share with the world and the times when she made a difference.A Private War is perhaps the easiest to pick apart, because of constraints of time and genre. Rosamund Pike slips into Colvin’s skin entirely, in a portrayal praised by friends and former colleagues. However, it deals largely with the violence she covered and the trauma it left behind, and captures little of her sense of fun or ordinary life.Yet for me that was redeemed by a focus on the people to whom she devoted her working life, the civilians caught up in and crushed by war. In western films about war, its victims are too often treated as little more than props or backdrop in a heroine’s personal journey.Matthew Heineman, the director of A Private War, is a documentary-maker and ensured that all the survivors in the film – widows shelled in a basement in Syria, Libyans roiled by the sudden explosion of war – had lived through the events that they recreated in the film.They are given screen time, and tell their own stories, directly to viewers who would perhaps not hear them outside a Hollywood film.I went to see it with another veteran journalist, who knew Colvin and had worked in several of the places she reported from. He went in braced for cliches, but emerged shaking.While Colvin might have been bemused to see herself celebrated on such an incredible scale, she would almost certainly have been glad to see the terrible suffering in Syria brought to wider attention again. She was killed there because she cared and wanted others to as well.“Part of me thinks Marie is looking down saying, ‘Hey, what’s all the fuss, this is what we do,’” said Hilsum. “But I also think she would be glad that people were talking about Homs again, and hope that maybe some of the attention would be focused on Yemen and other under-reported conflicts and the people suffering in them.”In Extremis is published by Vintage (£20).

But Frances Murray, tour guide and shop manager, knows there are more on the way. Why? Because last week Netflix launched Outlaw King, a production about the life of Robert the Bruce, filmed in part at Linlithgow. And, following the huge success of the Outlander TV drama series, filmed in several Scottish locations, the country knows a thing or two about the TV effect.“The uplift places such as this get from television shows like Outlander is amazing, and we’re expecting the same from Outlaw King,” said Murray yesterday. “Sometimes, though, we get tourists from overseas who ask to see specific rooms where some of the scenes were shot, and we have to explain that they don’t actually exist. But this is such a beautiful and interesting building that they soon get wrapped up in it.”The West Lothian palace was only one of several Scottish locations for the new film, which stars Chris Pine as the warrior overlord. The others read like the index of a tourist brochure: Borthwick Castle, Dunfermline Abbey, Glasgow Cathedral and Doune Castle near Stirling. And the beautiful landscapes of Skye are already upstaging the principal actors.VisitScotland, the national tourist agency, has produced two glossy and substantial brochures that chronicle some recent world-class productions. On the cover of one of them a moody Daniel Craig as James Bond in Skyfall stands beside his silver Aston Martin with the mists of Glen Coe gathering behind him. In 2015 an online poll conducted by USA Today voted Scotland the world’s best cinematic destination. The country’s filmic credits include well-known movies such as Braveheart, The Da Vinci Code, The 39 Steps and Whisky Galore. But it also makes atmospheric cameo appearances in movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, where the ethereal beauty of Harris was deployed by Stanley Kubrick to realise his imagined Jupiter.Next year another major historical drama built around this nation’s vivid and bloody history will be released in British cinemas. This time it will be Mary, Queen of Scots herself who will get the Hollywood treatment in a film starring Saoirse Ronan and David Tennant.Tourism, along with whisky and salmon, forms the cornerstone of the Scottish economy. In a recent interview Malcolm Roughead, chief executive of VisitScotland, said: “Tourism is integral to sustaining communities across Scotland by generating income, creating jobs and stimulating social change – and it generates around £11bn of economic activity.” He also reckoned that one new job is created in Scotland for every £60,000 spent by visitors.Fiona Hyslop, culture and tourism minister in the Scottish government, yesterday spoke of her delight that the world’s top film and television producers are now making Scotland one of their first destinations. “Producers now know that when they choose Scotland, as well as magnificent scenery and locations they’re now getting highly-skilled and professional technical crews to go with them,” she said.Crucially, too, the long wait for a world-class national film studio could soon be over. At last week’s Bafta Scotland awards first minister Nicola Sturgeon referred to the need for a national film studio, saying: “Watch this space.”Yet some would say that with its remarkable scenery and stunning vistas, Scotland already possesses the best natural film studio in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2656917ae0a9647a4e1d0cc5b86109bae8f338b5/0_77_3003_1802/master/3003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ec4722983e13b3e7a2fe5424f85fc42","title":"one to watch boygenius lucy dacus phoebe bridges julien baker","story":"Three fast-rising indie solo artists join forces in the studio, with transcendent resultsAmerican singer-songwriters Lucy Dacus, Phoebe Bridgers and Julien Baker aren’t the sort to let the fact they’re only two albums into their solo careers stop them forming a supergroup.

Greening told the Observer: “The parliamentary deadlock has been clear for some time. It’s crucial now for parliament to vote down this plan, because it is the biggest giveaway of sovereignty in modern times.“Instead, the government and parliament must recognise we should give people a final say on Brexit. Only they can break the deadlock and choose from the practical options for Britain’s future now on the table.”Greening added: “Like many of us, Jo Johnson is a pragmatist on Britain’s relationship with the EU. But Conservative MPs can increasingly see that this sovereignty giveaway from No 10 leaves our country with less say over rules that govern our lives … That is not in the national interest, it’s the worst of all worlds and it resolves nothing.”Her intervention – just days before May hopes to win agreement for her plans in her deeply ided cabinet – shows how Tories on both sides of the Brexit ide are finding common cause, protesting that her blueprint would leave the UK tied to the EU’s economic systems but with no say over the rules that govern them. As a result, they say that rather than seizing back control from Brussels, it would do the reverse and leave the UK with less power.A letter to the prime minister, organised by the StandUp4Brexit campaign and circulated among Tory party constituency chairs, seen by the Observer, states that May’s proposals represent a “significant blow to our sovereignty”.It says that an agreement that would leave Britain “trapped in a customs union with the EU indefinitely”, as current plans could do, would “fly in the face of the referendum result” and risk “delivering a Corbyn government at the next election”.The letter goes on: “As Conservative chairmen, we therefore call on you … to ensure that the final deal complies with those red lines that you set out in both the 2017 election manifesto and your Lancaster House speech – namely leaving the customs union, the single market and ECJ over-all.”In his resignation statement on Friday, Jo Johnson said the country was “on the brink of the greatest crisis” since the second world war and argued that the Brexit deal on offer wasn’t “anything like what was promised”. He denounced the choice between May’s plans or a no-deal outcome as a “failure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis” that had left Britain facing “vassalage” or “chaos”.On Saturday, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he went further, saying another referendum would be the first opportunity for voters to have a say on what Brexit would actually mean, after two years of tortuous negotiations. “My view is that this is so different from what was billed that it would be an absolute travesty if we do not go back to the people and ask them if they actually do want to exit the EU on this extraordinarily hopeless basis,” he said.Asked whether he believed other ministers should quit over the issue, he encouraged them to do so if they shared his views. “I think this is so important that it’s up to MPs to take a stand. I’ve done so, if others feel that it’s right for them to do so, good on them.”One Tory donor warned last night that May was now heading towards an “explosion” with her own party. “She made incompatible promises to different constituencies,” he said. “An explosion is now the best forecast.”Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has come under pressure from some of his own MPs for saying that “we can’t stop” Brexit, just two months after he insisted “all options are on the table”, and shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said a second referendum with the option to remain in the EU should be kept open. Many Labour MPs say that if Corbyn were to back a second referendum, there would now be a majority in parliament to hold one.In an interview with Der Spiegel published on Friday, Corbyn said it was necessary to “recognise the reasons why people voted leave”. Luciana Berger, Mike Gapes, Wes Streeting and Chuka Umunna were among the Labour MPs to criticise the remarks, as a major row brews within the party over whether it should back a second poll if May’s deal were voted down in parliament. Asked on Saturday whether he agreed with Johnson’s call for a second referendum, Corbyn reiterated his opposition: “Not really, no,” he said. “The referendum took place. The issue now has to be how we bring people together.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dff43287b9a72b6f9610a354b8327434604ea61f/0_54_1613_967/master/1613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1eb989570495fe17582fbd0a239f6da7","title":"labour mps criticise corbyn for saying we cant stop brexit","story":"Corbyn accused of ‘dereliction of duty’ after saying he cannot agree with Jo Johnson’s call for fresh voteLabour MPs have criticised Jeremy Corbyn after he announced “we can’t stop” Brexit just two months after he declared in his conference speech that “all options are on the table”.In an interview with Der Spiegel published on Friday, the Labour leader renewed his criticism of the EU’s economic policy and called upon the entire country to “recognise the reasons why people voted leave”.This comes after the transport minister Jo Johnson resigned from the government and accused Theresa May of offering MPs a choice between “vassalage and chaos”, prompting renewed calls for a second vote.Asked on Saturday if he could agree with Johnson’s call for a new referendum, Corbyn said: “Not really, no. The referendum took place. The issue now has to be how we bring people together, bring people together around the principles of our economy, our rights and that we don’t turn this country into some kind of offshore tax haven on the lines that Donald Trump might want us to.”Corbyn said any Brexit deal brought to the Commons by the government would need to be measured against Labour’s six tests for a withdrawal agreement. He said: “We will test the government against our six questions. Our six points will be put to them and we will vote accordingly.“If it means we vote against the government, we vote against the government. If it’s defeated, it means they’ve got a choice – either go back and negotiate something better or resign.“They’re questions about the benefits to every part of the UK. They’re questions about the Northern Ireland border, they’re questions about the kind of regulatory framework in which we’ll live.“I think those things are very important and, surely, it’s the duty of parliament and duty of the opposition to hold the government to account on this and that’s what we’ll do.”But the Labour MP Wes Streeting called on the party to make the “full-throated case” for a people’s vote.“Labour cannot sit by and allow the choice to be between the economic ruin of a hard Brexit or the loss of sovereignty under Theresa May’s deal, with Britain subjected to EU rules but with no say over them,” he said. “As with any fork in the road, there is always the option of turning back home.“We know this is a mess made by the Tories, but the Labour party can’t just sit back and watch. It’s time for all of us in the Labour party to make the full-throated case for a people’s vote with the option of remaining in the European Union.“That leadership must now come from the top, or our party may never be forgiven for the consequences that follow,” he added.At the party conference, Labour delegates left open the possibility of backing a second referendum if it could not force a general election. Chris Leslie, another Labour MP, called for the public to have the final choice and accused Corbyn of a “dereliction of duty”.“With even Tory ministers recognising Brexit threatens the poorest in society, our public services and Britain’s place in the world, to have a Labour leader just shrug about it, then go awol, is nothing short of a dereliction of duty,” he said.The Labour MP and former leadership contender Chuku Umunna said in a tweet that the party would never be forgiven if it ignored the wishes of Labour members and opted not to call for a second referendum.“We can stop this Tory Brexit but, ultimately, it should be for the people to decide,” he said. “A large majority of Labour members, supporters and voters not only want a people’s vote but to change our country in the EU. If the party sets its face against this, it will never be forgiven.”Corbyn, a longstanding Eurosceptic, has seemingly been mindful that a significant amount of Labour voters opted to leave in the June 2016 referendum.In the Der Spiegel interview, he criticised the neoliberal economic policies that are fundamental to the EU, saying working conditions had deteriorated in deprived areas of the UK, despite being protected by European legislation, and committed the party to enhancing workers’ rights in government.About 700,000 people rallied for a new Brexit referendum last month, the second largest march in recent memory, with consternation centred on the government’s apparent failure to secure an acceptable deal.However, there are concerns that a second referendum could embolden the far right in the UK, while Eurosceptics point to examples where votes within EU member states rejecting greater federalism and austerity have been overturned in what they say is yet more evidence that there is a “democrat deficit” within the union."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5203a01787185ee08a0a5309c9b087f9953a1e22/0_139_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93a967772856a25bd701a4dbce4a75d5","title":"nudge unit pushed way private sector behavioural insights team","story":"A team of former civil servants specialising in behavioural psychology now pulls in revenues of £14m a yearDavid Halpern pauses at the mention of a quote from one of the government’s senior Brexiters – that “people in this country have had enough of experts” – and briefly gazes out of a window in the Westminster offices of the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT).“Empirically, it doesn’t appear to be true,” replies the chief executive of the business that was once the Cabinet Office team nicknamed the “nudge unit”. It was spun off in 2014 as a “social purpose company” and is now co-owned by its employees, the Cabinet Office and the innovation charity Nesta.“Michael Gove made that remark, and he was talking about a very particular context, but if you actually look at the data, trust in experts has gone up over the last 10-15 years,” says Halpern. “I know everyone likes to say, ‘We’re sick of experts’, but it doesn’t appear to be the case.”The financial performance of BIT – which uses behavioural psychology to change habits and actions – certainly suggests expertise, as a commodity, is valuable.Ten years ago, BIT was a small unit of civil servants established with the remit to apply lessons from behavioural economics and psychology to public policy. But it has now grown into the type of British export success story that Gove and fellow Brexiters might want to celebrate.BIT’s clients range from governments and public bodies to the World Bank, and its work s traditional “nudge” territory – such as using behavioural psychology to prompt people to pay their taxes or make better use of public services – to involvement with Colombia’s peace process.But back in London there are some particularly interesting questions looming for an organisation that seems a curious cross between a Silicon Roundabout startup and a Whitehall department, and where young staff on sofas tap away on Macbooks in the same building as Conservative Central Office.What now for nudge in the age of Brexit? Also, for an outfit created under David Cameron to find ways of doing “more with less” under austerity, what might happen in the event of a Corbyn government committed to high public spending? “I worked for Tony Blair for six years, so I did live through a period where there was a lot of money … but it seems that governments always struggle,” replies Halpern, a psychologist who lectured at Cambridge, Oxford and Harvard before entering government. “The most important thing is that if the taps do get turned on again – like in health and elsewhere – will we really spend it wisely and well?”By now, he says, BIT, he says, has now run hundreds of trials and “reached the point where it’s no longer a matter of supposition, as it was in 2010”.“We can now say with a high degree of confidence these models give you best policy,” adds Halpern, who has plenty to say that might interest not just business, but conceivably a Labour Treasury team headed by John McDonnell.“What then happens is that good firms get the best candidates because they go there, and the worst firms have to start paying the market premium because you have ‘de-shrouded’ their attributes.”It’s just example of what Halpern regards as some of the newer, more cutting-edge areas of behavioural science and nudge theory, focusing on market design. “It’s no longer just about a single prompt … getting chocolate away from supermarket checkouts because people find it irresistible. It’s about careful design – the sugar levy – in ways so that enough marginal consumers drive producers to reformulate their products.”BIT is active, too, on the financial front. Work in partnership with the Money Advice Service has been developing ways of helping squeezed families to tackle debt and encourage “rainy day savings”.“In India it has been found that if you give workers their money in two tranches they are more likely to save. It’s even more effective if you give them the envelopes with pictures of their kids on it, or if they have to tear that picture in order to get the money,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/493935a8b45237441243aba26d369929200e5d95/0_1331_3280_1966/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=861dc10cd54ee05812b37d4ec22f2aa8","title":"dozens of cat mummies found in 6000 year old tombs in egypt","story":"An ancient unopened tomb and rare mummified scarab beetles were also unearthed at the site south of CairoDozens of cat mummies and a rare collection of mummified scarab beetles have been discovered in seven sarcophagi, some dating back more than 6,000 years, at a site on the edge of the pyramid complex in Saqqara, south of Cairo.Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Enany said the discovery was made by an Egyptian archaeological mission during excavation work started in April.Three of the tombs had been used for cats, he said, while one of four other sarcophagi discovered at the site was unopened. The tomb dates from the Fifth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom and is unusual because the facade and door are intact, meaning its contents may still be untouched, said Mohamed Youssef, director of the Saqqara area.

I never heard about them before.”Among the dozens of cat mummies unearthed were 100 wooden, gilded statues of cats and one in bronze dedicated to the cat goddess Bastet.Cats held a special place in ancient Egypt and were mummified as religious offerings.A collection of wooden, gilded statues of a lion, a cow and a falcon was also unearthed at the Saqqara site.The antiquities department also found painted wooden cobra and crocodile sarcophagi, a collection of gilded statues depicting animal features, as well as objects including amulets, canopic jars, writing tools and papyri baskets.Agence France-Presse and Reuters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c71b472115ac0a1fd5d3d56de6fd83c01f37433/571_2231_3355_2013/master/3355.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f16a9424d2a9402cc386d086d1c8cfab","title":"one day six operations three kidneys organ donor chain brought together","story":"A year after their life-changing surgery, we bring together six people in a kidney donor circle for the first timeOn the morning of 13 September 2017, Martha Myers was being prepared for surgery at north London’s Royal Free hospital. Stayin’ Alive was playing in the background. The anaesthetist had asked what she would like to hear, and she’d requested the Bee Gees – calming, “happy music” that took her back to her youth in Colombia. Meanwhile, 130 miles north, in Nottingham City hospital, Ryan Mace grappled with a pair of green surgical stockings, worrying that his gown would reveal his bottom as he walked to theatre. He’d wanted to do something like this since he was a teenager and now that the moment was here, he was ready. Back in London, south of the river at St George’s hospital, Steve Abbott had woken up feeling anxious. But his was a good ward to be on, full of high-spirited football chat that kept his mind off the day ahead. When the time for the operation finally came, he squeezed his son Ben’s hand before being wheeled away.Martha, Ryan and Steve were in perfect health. But over the course of the morning, surgeons at the three hospitals tussled gently with fatty tissue and chopped through blood vessels to remove a kidney from each of them. The organs were packed in ice and whisked down corridors, then handed to couriers eager to get on the road.Later that day, the theatre staff were back at work. Martha’s kidney had arrived in Nottingham, where it was transplanted into Ryan’s best friend, Lee Bennett. Ryan’s kidney went down the M1 to south London, and was given to Steve’s son Ben. And Steve’s kidney made the short journey across the Thames to be stitched into Martha’s husband, David. The circle was complete.This is the strange magic of kidney donation chains. If you need a transplant in the UK, you can join 5,000 other people on the national waiting list for a kidney from a deceased donor. Or, if you’re lucky, a partner, relative or friend might offer you one as a living donor (for many people, as long as they have been fully assessed, it is possible to live healthily with only one kidney). But if you and they are incompatible by blood group or tissue type, a transplant may not be possible.Instead, you and your would-be donor can join the UK Living Kidney Sharing Scheme (pdf). Four times a year, in what’s known as a matching run, a sophisticated algorithm works out chains linking incompatible pairs such as Martha and David, Ryan and Lee, and Steve and Ben. Reshuffled into compatible pairs, everyone in the chain who needs one ends up getting a kidney – not from their friend or loved one, but from a stranger.The process relies on logistical masterminding by staff at the UK’s 23 transplant centres, as much as it does on the mind-boggling computer science it’s built around. Ideally, all the operations in a chain are scheduled to take place on the same day, within eight weeks of a matching run, and only after everyone has been painstakingly assessed to ensure the matches will work and they are well enough for surgery.It’s a curiously under-recognised scheme, among the general public at least, but its impact is growing every year. The first UK kidney exchange took place in 2007, with a two-way swap between four people. In 201718, 127 of the 1,010 living kidney transplants carried out – one in eight – came about as a result of the sharing scheme. It’s also a British success story: the UK far outstrips any other country in Europe in this field, carrying out about half of all the transplants made possible by sharing schemes.Just over a year after their surgery, five of the six members of one chain have agreed to meet to talk about their experiences and be photographed for the . (The sixth, Steve, lives in the US and joins us via FaceTime later he will be digitally added to the magazine’s group shots.) Though some patients and donors matched in chains end up exchanging cards or letters after the transplants are complete, only a tiny proportion ever meet: anonymity is an important part of the process.“Nice bunch of good-looking people!” says Martha as she and David come into the photo studio, where Lee and Ryan are waiting with their partners. As the writer who arranged this, I had been apprehensive about the meeting, fearing it might be awkward. But when I introduce 43-year-old Lee to Martha, 60, as the man who got her kidney, she grips him by the hand, pulls him to her in an embrace and begins to sob softly. “Nice to meet you,” he says, a broad smile on his face. “I’m looking after it for you.” They get chatting. Was he ever on dialysis, Martha asks: she supported her husband through nearly nine years of it before his first transplant in 1999 when that kidney began to fail, she was determined to donate one herself, rather than see him so ill again. No, Lee says, but he was on the brink: “You came up trumps just in time.”Ben slips into the room 10 minutes later, all but unnoticed as the group exchange recovery stories and praise for the NHS. He and Ryan, his donor, greet each other with a warm blokeishness, a firm handshake and an exchanged, “All right?”There’s an easy amiability in the room. David, 70, is an amateur expert on all things kidney-related and quickly established as the unofficial elder statesman of the group, while Ben, 27, is affable, dry-witted and hungover. Their conversations reveal a shared understanding of ill health and the joy that successful treatment can bring.“With my first transplant,” David announces to the group, minutes after arriving, “I knew it was from a woman because the minute I started peeing I was sitting down on the toilet.” They talk about the thing they all remember about the day of the surgery: one of the donors had misunderstood the instructions to drink only clear fluids and enjoyed a cup of tea with milk in the morning, causing an unnerving last-minute delay. “I was literally yards away from the operating table,” Ryan remembers. “All I could think about was Lee.”The culprit, it’s soon revealed, was Martha, winningly irrepressible whether she’s holding forth on the need for greater kindness in the world or sniffing back tears. “I love her,” Lee’s wife Karen says to me at one point. “I want to take her home.”Away from the bustle of tea being made and the photographer arranging his shots, Lee and Ryan sit side by side, legs crossed identically over their knees. They have known each other only five years, but consider themselves best friends. Both grew up in villages near Nottingham, and later worked out that they had played rugby against each other at school. “We’ve got the same silly sense of humour, similar interests. We just hit it off,” Ryan, 42, says. “He’s such a relaxed person – I’ve learned a lot from him.”But in the time they’d known each other, Lee, who runs a kitchen design business, had been getting increasingly ill. At the age of 28, soon after returning from honeymoon, he discovered he had polycystic kidneys, an inherited condition that his mother, who died when he was 18 of a brain tumour, had suffered from, too. Karen would have given him a kidney if she could, but already knew she had only one good one herself. Ryan, who works for the Royal Air Force in recruitment and selection, was quick to step in. “For me, it was a no-brainer,” he says. “The experts told me I was going to be fine, so why wouldn’t I try to help somebody? Seeing how Lee’s health was deteriorating, there was never a question in my mind.”He cried after seeing Lee for the first time post-surgery. “It was just relief, I think,” he says. “The big thing for me was his eyes. As we’d got closer to the date of the operation, they were quite dark and sunken. When I saw him afterwards, it was like a different guy.” He has kept his green surgical socks looking at them makes him smile. Lee still finds it hard to grasp that a friend would do what Ryan did. “It’s taken me back to being twentysomething again,” he says. “It feels like a miracle cure.”The main business of the kidney is to remove toxins and excess fluids from the blood and turn the waste into urine when they don’t, those things remain in the body, causing symptoms including high blood pressure, extreme tiredness and persistent headaches. Left untreated, kidney failure is eventually fatal. Aside from a transplant, dialysis – which filters the blood using either a machine or the inside lining of the abdomen – is the main treatment but it only partially compensates for lost kidney function, is disruptive to daily life and can cause unpleasant side-effects. Transplants save and transform lives.“Kidney disease and dialysis affect everything that we would take for granted in life,” explains Lisa Burnapp, NHS Blood and Transplant’s lead nurse for living donation. “They can impact on your work, your ability to have children, what you can eat and drink, where you go on holiday.” And while the average wait for a kidney from a deceased donor has fallen to just over two years, a living kidney is preferable – because it comes from a healthy person and can be transplanted in a planned fashion. It’s often described as the Rolls-Royce of transplants.I joined Burnapp at Guy’s hospital in London on a sunny morning earlier this year, as she looked through the results of a matching run carried out the day before. The algorithm, developed by Glasgow University’s school of computing science, identifies several different types of swap. There are circular exchanges between either two or three pairs, but also chains started by altruistic donors – people who simply want to donate a kidney to anyone who needs it, rather than for someone close to them. These are gamechangers, Burnapp told me, because one of them can enable up to three transplants to take place, with one kidney ending up with a patient on the main waiting list.Altruistic donors on the register used to be given the chance to opt into the matching runs. But from this year, in a bid to increase transplant numbers, they have been added automatically – unless there’s a high-priority, difficult-to-match patient on the waiting list for whom they’re a “golden ticket”.We peered at Burnapp’s laptop: the matching run had been triggered at 10.39am plus 10 seconds. One hour, 32 minutes and 32 seconds later, the algorithm had sifted through 271 patients and their pairs to identify 82 transplants, including 17 three-way exchanges. It’s the highest number of transplants yet to be identified in a run. Exciting, said Burnapp, and proof that efforts to develop the scheme are working. “To me it’s really heart-lifting, because these are patients who would never see a transplant. It just means everything, really.”Since the living kidney scheme started in 2007, about 2,000 patients have registered on it, and more than 900 people have benefited from a transplant – including 19 children, the youngest aged three. As well as meeting a chain who have had surgery, I want to speak to a pair who are currently going through the process. I meet Richard and Maureen Ventre at the Royal Liverpool hospital with their donor coordinator, Ann Strong, 12 days before Maureen is due to give a kidney that will mean Richard gets a much-needed transplant. The retired managing director of a family construction business, he was diagnosed with a collapsed kidney in 2016. It was a shock: unlike a lot of kidney disease, his problems came on quickly. “It’s like you’ve got a nice lively battery in you and all of a sudden it’s just gone,” he says.He and Maureen met in the heatwave of 1976, working a summer season in a grand Georgian hotel in Torquay. He was a 23-year-old student from Liverpool and she, aged 17, had come all the way from Glasgow. The scousers, geordies and Glaswegians always seemed to gravitate towards each other, they remember, and one night they found themselves out on a double date. Today, they have the calm, quiet closeness of a couple who have been married for almost four decades.Six years ago the Ventres lost the eldest of their four children, Tim he drowned in a pool in El Salvador at the age of 30. He was a traveller, Richard explains, and they would love to follow in his footsteps south-east Asia, maybe, off the beaten track. They aren’t sure that will be possible now, but they keep it in mind.Maureen, who worked until recently in admissions at a local college, is twinkly-eyed and chatty, but when I ask about her decision to donate, her face crumples up with tears and no words come out. “It’s just obvious,” she eventually mutters. “No, it wasn’t hard.”In fact, she and Richard, 59 and 65 respectively, are compatible, so her kidney could have gone straight to him but they decided to use the sharing scheme in the hope of getting him an even better match. This is encouraged: the more pairs in the pool, the more transplants are likely. They are now in a long altruistic (and anonymous) donor chain: Richard’s new kidney will come from the altruistic donor and Maureen’s will go to a patient in another pair, whose donor’s kidney will then go to someone on the waiting list.At 8am on the dot on the morning of their surgery, Strong gets a call on her mobile from the hospital Richard’s kidney is coming from everything looks OK there. She checks in with the centre that will receive Maureen’s kidney it’s also good to go.I join her in theatre later. The kidney must be cut and cauterised away from the yellowy fat that surrounds it until only the vein, arteries and ureter are holding it in place the persistent snipping of the cutting tool rings out in the cool hush of the room. The keyhole surgery is done via three 1cm incisions, the surgeon, Ajay Sharma, wielding the instruments while the registrar holds the camera (the kidney will come out of a larger cut, around 7cm long). They stand almost shoulder to shoulder, never taking their eyes off the large screen above them, the pink of the tangle of kidney and fat it shows reflected in their glasses.Dan Ridgway, the second surgeon, watches from the sidelines. “These are the ones that keep me awake at night because, essentially, you’re a healthy person having an operation you don’t need,” he says. “I don’t even call them patients. They’re VIPs.” In the afternoon, he’ll be the one fixing Richard Ventre’s new kidney into place.Once the arteries are clamped and cut, it’s crucial for the health of the kidney that it’s removed as soon as possible. The time each is done is recorded on a whiteboard. “Time on the board, artery one,” Ridgway says. “12.06,” comes the instruction from Strong to a nurse. At 12.09, they repeat the process for the second artery. The vein is cut last, and suddenly, at 12.10, a bowl containing the kidney is thrust towards Ridgway. His task now is to swiftly cool it and flush out the blood. A tall man, he sits hunched over a trolley at the foot of the operating table, sets the kidney in a bed of sterile ice and uses tweezers to locate an artery. Hanging beside him is a bag of perfusing fluid – the liquid used to wash out the kidney – and once he has the artery between his thumb and forefinger, the registrar inserts a tube. The fluid rushes in and the water in the bowl gradually turns red as the blood flows out. The kidney gets paler. “It’s lovely to see it come to life when they transplant it,” Strong says, “because it goes in that colour and then pinks up.”Ridgway skilfully peels away the remaining fat and clips it off with long, curved scissors. “A good-sized kidney,” he says, giving it a little squeeze.The organ is triple-bagged, floating in perfusing fluid, and Strong buries it in an icebox. Ridgway gets a text from the surgeon who has removed the kidney that is going to Richard Ventre. “Everything fine,” it says. “Good luck.”Down the neon-lit corridor, the courier is already waiting for us and, as soon as the paperwork is filled in, she’s off, back down in the lifts and towards the hospital where the next patient in the chain is waiting. It’s 12.31pm. You can get a kidney pretty much anywhere in the UK in four hours, Strong says. Couriers will often use blue lights, and the organs are flown between cities for longer journeys. “Every hour counts,” she says. “The longer it’s out of the body, the slower it might be to work.”Just after 4.30pm, Ridgway – who’s been to Anfield to buy a Liverpool away kit for his son during the surgical break – pops his head into Strong’s office: the donated kidney has arrived. We fetch it from the ward and Strong hands him the box with a cheery, “It’s all yours.” He lopes into the lift, heading straight up to theatre. In the office, Strong reclines in her chair and beams. “There you go,” she says. “It’s great, isn’t it?”When we meet, David tells me he hadn’t wanted his wife to donate a kidney. “I just didn’t want her to go through it,” he says. “But she made me realise I had to do it – not just for myself, but for her.” They got together six months after Martha arrived in England from the Colombian city of Bucaramanga to study business in 1985, and married five years later. “Three months down the line, he got ill and the best years of our lives for having a family were gone,” she says. By his last year on dialysis, David was so weak that he was forced to close his successful design and artwork consultancy, aged just 49. “What kind of life is that for the two of us?” Martha had asked of the prospect of her husband going back on dialysis. “I didn’t think that I could cope with more,” she says.When he woke up from surgery last year, David couldn’t believe how well he felt. “I was sending texts, emails,” he says. “I felt great.” He listened to music on the radio a lot in the days that followed and frequently found himself in tears, overwhelmed by the realisation of what Martha, and the kidney exchange scheme, had made possible.“Some people say, ‘You’re unlucky because you’ve been ill so long’,” he says. “I’m lucky. I’m lucky that Martha came into my life and I’m very lucky that I’ve got this kidney. I’ve got a chance for us to go and enjoy ourselves.”This was Ben’s second transplant, too he suffered kidney failure at the age of 19 and his mother donated directly to him three months later. Early in 2016, the recruitment consultant was told by his doctors at St Helier hospital, in Surrey, that that kidney might only last another six months. He professes not to have minded the two months he spent on dialysis before his first transplant (“I got to watch Come Dine With Me for four hours three times a week and eat really nice sandwiches”) but this time, with a partner, a demanding job and a football team full of teenagers to coach, he was desperate to avoid it.The delay was difficult, but Ben was told that Ryan’s kidney – “a big juicy one” – was, in fact, a better match for him. “It’s working wonderfully,” he says. Of everyone in the chain, he’s the least given to dwelling on the emotional side of what he’s been through, though he does remember crying at his first dialysis session, struck by the reality of how ill he was.I spoke to Ben’s dad, Steve, on the phone. Although he lived overseas and ended up travelling back and forth to the UK seven times in a year as a result, he was determined to donate. “He’s my son,” the 55-year-old builder said. “Simple as that. You don’t like to see your kids suffering.”Steve hoped his kidney would give someone a good life but had never really thought about who might end up with it. “As long as Ben got his kidney and he was fine, you could have put it in a pie and cooked it, for all I cared,” he said. But when Ben gets hold of him on a video call at the photoshoot and David tells him how grateful he is, something shifts. “When I started speaking to David it sort of sunk in a bit,” he tells me later. “It was done for Ben, but I have helped someone else have a normal-ish life.”David, meanwhile, is thrilled to discover that his kidney came from a fellow Chelsea fan. He emails Steve that evening, and later shares the message with me: “It is an incredible feeling to think that someone like you has made this incredible gift for a loved one and you have ended up helping not one but two people,” it says. “A million thanks to you.”A few months after their surgery, I catch up with the Ventres. Richard’s kidney is working well and he’s started playing a bit of golf again. Maureen still feels lethargic at times, but she’s enjoying walking and swimming, and hopes to return to yoga soon. They are due to spend their 39th wedding anniversary at the hotel in Torquay where they met, their first trip back since the 70s. And they still hope to travel to some far-flung destinations one day, if the doctors approve.Meanwhile, the members of our six-strong chain plan to keep in touch. Ryan and Ben have been chatting online about their recruitment work David and Martha want to take Ben and his dad to a Chelsea match next time Steve is in the UK, maybe even get a box. Martha and Lee are meeting for a drink when he’s next in London, and she hopes to arrange a reunion for everyone a year from now.When they met, Lee told the group he’d thought he’d only be interested in meeting Martha, his donor. “But having met everybody it’s strange how it all feels interlinked,” he said. “None of it would have happened if it hadn’t been for everyone.”• For more information, go to organdonation.nhs.ukabout-donationliving-donation Hear Rachel Williams talk about the story behind this article on the new  podcast, Today in Focus, later this month, at the.Commenting on this piece?

Hannah Letters was one of them. She talks about how she got back on trackThe bullying started when Hannah Letters was 11. “I struggled with the transition to secondary school and found it hard to make friends.” Her classmates made snide comments about her appearance. When her mother was diagnosed with cancer, the comments got worse. She was sent messages on social media, telling her that no one liked her. “One of the girls turned and said to me, ‘If you had looked after your mother better, she wouldn’t have got cancer.’ I had such low self-esteem by then, anything she said I believed. I started to blame myself.”By the time she was 13, Letters was self-harming. The bullies were constantly on her mind and she would wake up screaming from nightmares. She wasn’t happy with the response she got from her school, and “each time my mother or I complained, the bullying got worse”. When the bullies physically attacked her, it was the last straw for Letters’ mother. She took her off the school roll. That meant her school was absolved of its legal responsibility to provide her with an education. She became yet another statistic: one of the 16,000 children aged 11 to 15 who, each year, “self-exclude” from school due to bullying.By then, Letters was a wreck and could not contemplate starting a new school. “I felt worthless, stupid, ugly and fat – I didn’t see the point in being alive. I had no motivation to learn.”Her mother’s attempts to home-school her soon floundered. Letters spent an entire year feeling too afraid to leave her home in case she ran into any of her old classmates. Her weight dropped dramatically and at 14, she tried to kill herself.Letters is now 17. Confidence radiates from her. She is a healthy weight and speaks so articulately and with so much dignity, it is difficult to believe she is still so young. A year ago, she started a BTec in applied science and is planning to study medicine at university and become a neurosurgeon. The calm assurance with which she says this makes it clear she will allow nothing to stand in her way.Her transformation began when an education charity, Red Balloon, took Letters on as a student at one of its “learner centres” three years ago. The charity combines educational programmes with therapeutic support and is the only one of its kind in the country. Each year, it helps traumatised and severely bullied children – most of whom, like Letters, have self-excluded from school – to get back on an academic track, make friends and reconnect with society, with the aim of them returning to mainstream education, training or work.“The chances that they would do that on their own is negligible,” says Carrie Herbert, a former teacher who founded Red Balloon 22 years ago in her own home. She had seen these children failed, repeatedly, by the education system – and she knew that without any qualifications they would suffer negative consequences from the bullying potentially for the rest of their lives. “In this country, children who bully get a funded education and the children who are bullied do not. Our students would have been on the scrapheap. They go back out into the world rescued.”The key to the charity’s success, she says, is that children are allowed to negotiate their own curriculum. “These kids have had a terrible experience and been out of school for years. When they arrive, they can’t look at you, they fidget, they shield their faces, they wear hoodies. We ask them what they are interested in. We aim to get them back into a love of learning.”Letters says: “The teachers at Red Balloon don’t treat you like a child. They teach you so you can progress in what you want to do. It’s very relaxed. You feel respected, and can trust them.”Teachers go by their first names and there are no uniforms. Half of each school day is devoted to nurturing the child’s wellbeing, involving therapy sessions and group communication. “Our aim is to return them to mainstream school, knowing how to build relationships and how and why relationships break down,” Herbert says. “They arrive with no self-esteem so we want them to leave with a good track record in education, knowing they’re competent and can problem solve. And finally, we want them to leave with friends.”It is this aspect of the course that has had a huge impact on Gaby, 16 (not their real name). The trans teenager had suffered verbal and physical homophobic bullying for years at school, despite repeatedly reporting the abuse to teachers. By the age of 14, Gaby had started to self-harm and at 15, attempted suicide. “I couldn’t see any other way out. Other people hated me so much, I hated myself.”After the suicide attempt, Gaby self-excluded from school. Two months later, they started learning online with RBAir. Within a month, they had stopped self-harming and experienced a dramatic improvement in their mental health. “At first the other students didn’t know I was trans because they couldn’t see me, and then later when we met up, they had already accepted me for who I was. Plus, when you have been bullied yourself, I think it makes you more tolerant and open-minded.”Three months into the programme, Gaby was discharged by the NHS from weekly therapy sessions. They left Red Balloon and restarted mainstream education in September. Letters is feeling equally positive about the future. “I feel a lot of hope.” Her mother, who has recovered from her cancer, is a constant source of support. How to parent a bullied child, by Carrie Herbert of Red Balloon1 Talk to the school, and try to get alongside them. “Tell the head, ‘I’m really interested in having my child in this school and being educated.’ Then talk about their strategies for tackling bullying. Ask how you can help. Education is free in this country, but sometimes you have to fight for it. If the school says it is your child who is the problem, ask them: why aren’t they dealing with the problem then?”2 Don’t take your child off roll. If the school threatens to prosecute you because your child isn’t turning up, go with it and say in court: “My child is not at school because he or she was being bullied and here’s the evidence – all the letters and emails I have written.” If you take a child off roll, you are abandoned, she says. “You get no speech therapy, no counselling, you can’t access children’s mental health services – your child has effectively gone missing.”3 Don’t criticise your kid. “They hate it. It doesn’t matter if it was sarcastic or a joke. Never ever say it. Instead, listen to your child. Believe what they say. Unconditional love builds self-esteem.”• You can donate to Red Balloon at  redballoonlearner.org. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Bautista Delguy crossed for Argentina, who edged ahead in the second-half through Nicolás Sánchez’s third penalty before Ireland battled back as Johnny Sexton finished with 13 points .Joe Schmidt’s men lost O’Brien to an arm injury and scrum-half Marmion to a leg concern - and that after Robbie Henshaw had pulled up in the warmup with a hamstring complaint.Ireland could now be without British and Irish Lions Test star O’Brien and Marmion for next weekend’s eagerly anticipated clash with New Zealand in Dublin.The luckless O’Brien, who was starting his first Test in almost a year following shoulder and knee trouble, now looks set for another stint on the sidelines.The Ireland captain, Rory Best, said: “We were probably a little bit slow out of the blocks and they were winning the 50-50s. We had to really dig deep and grind parts of that first half out.“There’s a lot to work on and we know next week against New Zealand is a big step up and we know we are going to have to be a lot better.”Ireland’s haste and expectations almost got the better of them from the start here. Sánchez’s shot at goal put Argentina into an early lead before the hosts punted three penalties to the corner.But just when Ireland looked to be leaving their opponents’ 22 empty-handed, up popped Marmion to nip home after a potent scrum. Sexton missed the conversion before Sánchez slotted a second penalty after sloppy Irish work in losing the restart. Matías Orlando and Jerónimo de la Fuente then carved open Ireland’s midfield for a fine Pumas score, with Delguy ing in gleefully at the corner.Ireland’s inaccuracy bit again when the pack bungled a set lineout move, knocking on just five metres out. The forwards traded stony faces and blank expressions – then powered Argentina off their own scrum ball to set up a try. Aki scythed through traffic to storm home as Ireland continued to chase control.Sexton traded penalties with Sánchez for Ireland to carry an edgy 15-14 lead into the break.Sánchez booted his third penalty to push the Pumas into a 17-15 advantage to start the second half.Ireland edged back in front 18-17 approaching the hour, but had to face the final quarter without Marmion. His replacement, McGrath, nipped in for Ireland’s third try, sealing the win and settling frayed nerves.“It was a real test match, really arduous,” said Schmidt. “They were hard at the back, hard off the ruck and hard off the line and really squeezed us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8713910aaf9f885987d67275afa9c11bf4752efa/0_295_4688_2813/master/4688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c52dfbda099124db206ab32cd040dfd1","title":"lewis hamilton brazilian f1 gp pole","story":"Lewis Hamilton followed his title-sealing win in Mexico with a further statement of authority by taking pole for the Brazilian Grand Prix thanks to a peerless lap at Interlagos. Sebastian Vettel in the Ferrari was in second, keeping his place after a two-hour delay as stewards investigated him for a breach of regulations. Hamilton’s Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas was in third.Hamilton put in two sparkling laps in the final session, neither of which could be matched, and he took pole with a new track record of 1min 7.281sec. He was a tenth clear of Vettel and rightly proud of a performance that reflects a superlative season.Vettel, whose temperament has been questioned after his championship challenge was stymied by a series of errors, almost proved too impetuous during the session. The German was referred to the stewards after he did not turn off his engine when boarding the weighbridge during Q2, damaging the device.Vettel was keen to finish the process as quickly as possible in order to put in a lap before the rain got any heavier and could have been disqualified. “They shouldn’t call us when the conditions are changing like that, it is unfair to call us in,” he said.The Ferarri driver endured a tense wait for the steward’s decision before receiving a reprimand and a €25,000 (£21,843) fine, for failing to follow the instructions of officials. The drivers’ title is already gone but continual misjudgments when under pressure is something he must address if he is to challenge for the championship next season.There was better news at McLaren. The team, who are enduring a terrible season, at least gave Fernando Alonso a reason to feel optimistic when they announced on Saturday that he will drive for them at next year’s Indy 500. Alonso, who finished 18th and who leaves F1 at the end of this year, competed at Indy in 2017. With wins at Monaco and Le Mans he is attempting to add the final part of motor racing’s triple crown by securing a victory at the Brickyard.With Hamilton having secured his fifth title in Mexico, at a race where Mercedes were off the pace, his 10th pole of the season is a strong return to form.He secured a 100th pole for Mercedes and there remains unfinished business for the British driver and his team in Brazil.Mercedes have yet to clinch the constructors’ championship and Hamilton has been clear he wants to ensure they do so. Currently 55 points in front of Ferrari with 86 available from the last two races, Ferrari must outscore Mercedes by 13 points to take the fight to the final round in Abu Dhabi.Should Mercedes secure the title, they will have equalled Ferrari’s record of five consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ championships, which they achieved with Michael Schumacher between 2000 and 2004.It may not be straightforward however. Vettel and his teammate Kimi Räikkönen, who was fourth, set their times on the soft tyre in Q2, giving them more strategic options over their rivals who will all start on the supersoft rubber. It was a perfectly timed, bold and tactical decision by Ferrari that may yet prove to be inspired."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e89d0cc6b7de4e062ae48836b675af4039fa434f/7_330_3485_2091/master/3485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44fed83572df7ac649633533b601d0a6","title":"oleksandr usyk tony bellew report","story":"If we never hear the Z-Cars theme in a British ring again, we will nevertheless have the stirring memories of the fighter who brought all the passion of his Evertonian roots to every occasion, big or small. Tony Bellew lost his 34th and final fight here on Saturday night, stopped in the eighth round by one of the finest champions in boxing, Oleksandr Usyk.Curiously, it was probably Bellew’s most complete boxing performance in his 11 years as a professional, and it needed to be against Usyk, who arrived as the first undisputed cruiserweight champion since Evander Holyfield 30 years ago but the only one to hold these four belts. He left as the avenger of the last big Ukrainian to visit these shores, Wladimir Klitschko, and he might well be back. He would be more than welcome.“He’s a great big champion and I lost to a fine man,” the 35-year-old Bellew said in centre ring, to sustained applause. Usyk threw barely a blow in the first six minutes, while Bellew – the fittest of his 11-year career at just under the 14st 4lb limit – edged the first on workrate and landed heavy headshots in the second.The champion, egged on by his impatient challenger, came out of his southpaw shell in the third but paid for it with heavy Bellew counters over the top of his right lead. The Liverpudlian, a decent amateur himself, outboxed the Olympic gold medallist, to the astonishment of many ringside observers including Tommy Hearns.Bellew got the row he wanted in the fourth, stopping a stiff right then swinging back hard, sometimes wildly, and had Usyk under pressure near the bell, relaxed enough to showboat by resting on the ropes.There was both method and danger in Bellew’s game of cat-and-mouse but he oozed confidence, moving smartly and peppering the champion with body shots. As he added feints and double jabs to his attack, he looked far from the outclassed underdog, while Usyk, his matted hair cut short across his prominent brow, had the appearance of an archetypal eastern European Bond villain.Usyk was warming to his task as they got to the halfway stage, his jab now landing more frequently, but there was still no sign of his trademark assault and Bellew stole an otherwise close sixth with a late flurry.Usyk, needing to take more risks, kept rumbling forward with intent, but was wary of Bellew’s countering right, even when he trapped him in a neutral corner, and again he let the points slip.Bellew was blinking through the sweat at the start of the eighth and his energy level appeared to slip as he waited for one big shot, but found himself on the end of some major artillery, the last of which was a left hook he will only ever see on a replay. He dropped to the canvas like a stunned bull, and his longtime trainer and friend, David Coldwell, stepped in to comfort his man, a worthy loser who never gave anything less than his best.When smaller fighters approach or pass 30, they are caught between diminishing resources and lingering pride. For the 31-year-old former world champion Anthony Crolla, the prize for a unanimous points win over Daud Yordan (also 31) is a mandated challenge against the peerless and seemingly ageless Vasyl Lomachenko, who defends his WBA title next month against José Pedraza. So, for now at least, a rematch with the equally durable 35-year-old Scot Ricky Burns gets shuffled down Crolla’s list of priorities.Crolla’s 34th win was gruelling from start to finish, the Indonesian finishing strongly after early dominance by the home fighter. Three scores of 116-112 did not reflect the visitor’s effort or pedigree.Confirming there is no room for sentiment in the boxing business, Burns, the former three-weight world champion, earlier cut and stopped his compatriot and friend, 29-year-old Scott Cardle, in the third round of a non-title 10-rounder that could yet propel him back into title contention.The finishing right bounced off Cardle’s left shoulder, caught him flush and dumped him heavily. Bleeding and bruised around the left eye, Cardle, a late substitute for the injured Joe Cordina, looked in a sorry state when he rose on unsteady legs.Burns, who lost in this ring on points to Crolla just over a year ago in his 50th contest, continues to surprise with his resilience after 17 years as a pro. Whether he gets a fourth world title shot, though, is a tough call."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1441b0ec69a5bb07264f8181449fe436f8975333/0_0_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a2c7d7232f9146f83c1ba0c66ced6a","title":"wales australia autumn international series report","story":"• Wales 9-6 Australia• Penalty kicks from Leigh Halfpenny and Biggar seal narrow winWhen a losing run is as long as this, any old win will do. Wales, after 13 consecutive defeats against Australia, finally managed to beat them. That the score was 9-6, a throwback to rugby union’s bad old days, did not matter a jot to a raucous crowd.Nor should it, but to the neutral this made for desperate viewing. A match that was meandering to a slow death at 3-3 was salvaged by three penalties in the last quarter of an hour, as well as a touch of controversy when Samu Kerevi’s attempted charge-down of Leigh Halfpenny’s clearance was adjudged OK, despite the dreaded contact with the head. Moreover, Matt Toomua kicked Australia level at the end of the same passage, only for Dan Biggar to seal the win with two minutes to go.All the same, 9-6. Those numbers sent everyone scurrying to the record books. We were transported back to the 1980s, the last time Wales won with as few points (1981, 9-8 against Ireland) or won in as low-scoring a game (1988, 11-3 against England). The professional era has not seen anything like this. But for those last 10 minutes, we might have been back in the 19th century, 3-3 entering the final quarter.Thank the Great Redeemer, then, for some plot lines in the dying minutes. Halfpenny had just buried what would have been hideous torture by kicking Wales into a 6-3 lead with 10 minutes to go. In the first half he had missed two, repeat two, sitters by his standards, the second a blindfolded one. So when he was granted another shot from more or less the same spot, he was quick to step up and relieved to kick straight.Which leads us to another plot line of incompetence. It has become fashionable in the modern game to turn down shots at goal in favour of the corner. Australia took this fashion to an absurd extreme, turning down easy shots twice in the second half and making a mess of the subsequent lineouts.So Halfpenny’s success in the 68th minute, to establish a 6-3 lead for Wales, should not be taken for granted. Then came the controversy. Halfpenny cleared for touch, and Kerevi launched himself into an attempt to charge the ball down. Once airborne he could not prevent himself colliding with Halfpenny’s head, but should he have launched himself in the first place? Rugby can feel another furious debate coming on.Either way, pandemonium in the stadium, all the more so when the referee waved play on, all the more again when he awarded the burrowing David Pocock his umpteenth penalty of the day. Only then, from the hardest position of all, did Australia summon a kicker, and Toomua landed it – 6-6.It is difficult to know who should have been more disappointed with the match up to that point. Halfpenny held his head in his hands with that miss at the end of the first half, from pretty much in front on the 22. That just does not happen to him – or at least it never used to.But Australia might have felt they too should have turned round in front. No one dominated possession or territory, but the slickest moves were theirs. Kerevi had a tilt at the line in the first half Sefa Naivalu sparked another passage. But we are clutching at straws. Neither line was threatened.It became, as ever, a battle of the breakdown, Justin Tipuric and Pocock vying with each other, but both offences for the teams’ respective three points of the first half were for a No 6 straying offside. That is about as uninspiring as points-scoring gets.On it went into the second half - only without the points-scoring for most of it. Tatafu Polota-Nau supplied a plot twist vaguely worthy of the name, when he came in at the side to concede Halfpenny’s redemptive penalty. That set the scene for the relative drama of the last 10 minutes of the match.After Halfpenny and Toomua had exchanged their penalties, Ned Hanigan failed to roll away from a tackle with five minutes to go, and Biggar stepped up to put Wales – and the rest of us – out of their misery.Nevertheless, that is now seven wins in a row for the world’s No 3 team. The timing of next year’s World Cup is starting to look propitious.

Thereafter it’s textbook Hazlewood, line and length and treated with respect by the last senior partnership of the innings, well aware a long tail is padding up after them. 21st over: South Africa 78-3 (du Plessis 20, Miller 10) Miller and du Plessis have been busy at this crease together, looking for quick singles and running hard to turn ones into twos - it’s an intent that hasn’t been seen often from South Africa this series. They can only muster three from another nice Zampa over though. 20th over: South Africa 75-3 (du Plessis 19, Miller 8) Starc’s blitzkrieg only lasts a couple of overs with Stoinis recalled to the attack. After a couple of sighters du Plessis advances down the pitch and slams a length delivery through the offside for four. That’s the second time today the South African skipper has charged at Stoinis, boundaries arriving on both occasions. He tries again later in the over but Stoinis shortens his length and the guided pull shot is straight to the sweeper. 19th over: South Africa 68-3 (du Plessis 14, Miller 6) Zampa is unrecognisable compared to the man who struggled to land a delivery in Adelaide. He’s finding drift, turn and bounce, and South Africa have been forced to adjust accordingly. Credit to Aaron Finch for how he handled his leggie on Friday and for introducing him to the attack so early today. 18th over: South Africa 63-3 (du Plessis 10, Miller 5) Ouch! Starc hurts du Plessis with another one of those deliveries that leaps off a length. The South African skipper looks furious with the pitch. His bat’s on the ground, discarded. The index finger on his right hand must be causing him agony in his heavily padded glove, but he’s square-jawed and steely-eyed showing no hint of weakness. 17th over: South Africa 62-3 (du Plessis 9, Miller 5) Finch persists with Zampa, and it’s another tidy over with a confident LBW shout. The flipper beats du Plessis for pace, striking the South African in front but questions about height and line keep Aleem Dar’s finger in his pocket. 16th over: South Africa 59-3 (du Plessis 7, Miller 4) Aaron Finch can do no wrong! Another bowling change, another immediate wicket. It was a junk delivery from the recalled Mitchell Starc that accounted for Aiden Markram but nobody in gold could care less. Markram will be furious with his shot and his side will rue the amount of runs he left out in the middle after reaching 32 with some impressive strokes. David Miller has been promoted to number five and as in Adelaide his partnership with du Plessis once again looks to be game-defining. What on earth! A second legside strangle dismissal for South Africa. That delivery from Starc was going to be a wide until the inside-edge of Markram’s blade helped it on its way into the gloves of Carey. South Africa’s batting this series has left a lot to be desired. 15th over: South Africa 55-2 (Markram 32, du Plessis 7) This is interesting. Adam Zampa has been brought on early which is a confidence-boosting move from Finch after his leggie endured a tough night in Adelaide. And Zampa begins beautifully, pinning Markram to the crease first up and bellowing for an LBW. Dar declines the invitation but replays show it was a reasonable shout with a couple of Umpire’s Calls testifying to the tightness of the decision. A couple of singles keep the scoreboard moving but that was an encouraging start for Australia’s spinner. 14th over: South Africa 52-2 (Markram 30, du Plessis 6) Markram has shown he is keen to pull anything short of a length and for the third time today he smashes the ball into the grass bank. Actually, this one is over the bank and off into the Hobart suburbs. That will require a replacement ball. It’s a lovely looking pull shot, as already mentioned Ponting-like, featuring a swivel and a whipcrack stroke from a conventional backswing. Du Plessis senses the momentum is with his side and displays some intent of his own, advancing to Stoinis and drilling a flat drive past the bowler and away for four. Much better from the Proteas, taking the game back to Australia. 13th over: South Africa 41-2 (Markram 23, du Plessis 2) Cummins continues to give little away and once again he’s able to sow some doubt into the minds of South Africa’s batsmen with some sharp bounce on a length. 12th over: South Africa 39-2 (Markram 22, du Plessis 1) That’s better from South Africa and Markram. A four in front of square on the legside is pure timing and technique, but the six that soars miles over square leg that follows is raw power. South Africa have batted without intent for much of this series but there’s clearly talent that can prosper if they seize the initiative. 11th over: South Africa 27-2 (Markram 10, du Plessis 1) Deary me, South Africa are trying their hardest to improve Australian morale. Another maiden, this time to Cummins, and it almost includes the wicket of du Plessis with the skipper millimetres away from nicking an attempted pull from a superb bouncer that was heading right at the coat of arms on the South African helmet. 10th over: South Africa 27-2 (Markram 10, du Plessis 1) Every decision Aaron Finch has made since the innings break in Adelaide has worked, and many of them have involved inviting Marcus Stoinis to bowl. Once again the allrounder finds a crucial breakthrough, and once again it was with a far from unplayable delivery. Golden-arm Stoinis does it again! Two deliveries into his spell the allrounder leaks one down the legside but Hendricks can’t work the ball off his hip, tickling a fine edge that Carey does well to take as it dies on him down the legside. Sloppy batting from Hendricks and South Africa are in a pickle. 9th over: South Africa 25-1 (Hendricks 8, Markram 9) After battling to find runs South Africa enjoy two boundaries in three balls with Cummins straying down the legside and Hendricks helping the delivery on its way to the fine-leg rope. The bowler responds superbly with a length delivery that beats the outside edge, and then gets one to hold up in this slowish pitch, forcing Hendricks to check his drive and scoop an uppish push to Travis Head but the South Australian DROPS a tough chance ing away to his right. 8th over: South Africa 20-1 (Hendricks 4, Markram 9) This pair combined for a shambolic run out in Adelaide and it was almost a repeat in Hobart. Markram set off like a hare after clipping Hazlewood to midwicket but Hendricks could see Cummins was onto it like a flash and the single was not a going concern. Markram was stranded mid-pitch but Cummins’ throw on his knees wasn’t accurate enough to affect the dismissal. The pressure applied by Australia early here is really telling. Well, that is until Markram rocks back and pulls Ponting-like onto the grass bank over midwicket. Heck of a shot. 7th over: South Africa 14-1 (Hendricks 4, Markram 3) Cummins replaces Starc from the Church Street End and he continues to apply the pressure to South Africa’s batsmen. Just a leg-bye conceded from a very tidy over that showed Australia have mastered the correct length on this surface. 6th over: South Africa 13-1 (Hendricks 4, Markram 3) This is the most Hazlewood pitch of the series so far and his ability to find a surprising amount of bounce on a length is really unsettling South Africa. The first ball of this over spits at Hendricks as he eased forward, forcing him to question the force of his strokes. A third maiden of the day looks assured but from the final delivery Hendricks pulls out a textbook backfoot drive through extra cover with gorgeous timing. It took 17 balls to arrive but Hendricks’ first runs were worth the wait. 5th over: South Africa 9-1 (Hendricks 0, Markram 3) Starc’s line is a bit straighter to the right-handers this over but he’s too quick and bouncy to allow any easy runs through the legside. Markram makes solid connection with one deflection but it almost turned into another chance for that shortish midwicket fielder. Second maiden of the day and Australia right on top. 4th over: South Africa 9-1 (Hendricks 0, Markram 3) Hendricks has yet to settle and his nerves show four balls into another tight Hazlewood over. The angle down the legside suggests runs are on offer from the delivery but the moving parts of Hendricks’ stroke are not in sync and he almost lobs a catch to midwicket. 3rd over: South Africa 6-1 (Hendricks 0, Markram 2) Starc justifies his skipper’s decision to bowl first, removing one of South Africa’s premier batsmen with a beautiful delivery. He followed that up by making Aiden Markram dance first ball too. Just the start Australia were after! Perfect line and length from Starc, the ball angling in to de Kock from over the wicket but holding its line after pitching. De Kock offered the full face of the bat to a defensive stroke but he’s half a ball inside the line and he can only feather a faint nick through to Carey. 2nd over: South Africa 4-0 (de Kock 4, Hendricks 0) Hazlewood shares the new ball and he is into his groove immediately, hitting that awkward length, drawing Hendricks half-heartedly forward. The line is impeccable too, varying between middle-and-off and the corridor of uncertainty. Maiden over. 1st over: South Africa 4-0 (de Kock 4, Hendricks 0) It only takes Starc one delivery to cause South Africa issues, inducing a de Kock inside edge that clatters into the opener’s um,Mitchell Starc is at the top of his mark. Here we go!Out stomp Quinton de Kock and Reeza Hendricks to the centre of Blundstone Arena. Play will begin in a matter of seconds. Paul Wilson and Aleem Dar are your umpires today. Michael Gough is watching the telly. Bellerive Oval is such a beautiful place to play and watch cricket.In case you missed it, Australia’s women’s team got their World T20 campaign off to a flyer yesterday. The players are out for the anthems a little earlier than usual as there will be a short ceremony on this remembrance Sunday to mark the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day. Thanks to a gentle southerly breeze it’s a cool afternoon in Hobart, and that seems likely to give way to a positively chilly evening. It is dry though and there is plenty of blue sky among the fluffy clouds.The strip seems to ide opinion. Aaron Finch was keen to bowl first and take advantage of any life early on. Faf du Plessis was comfortable being put in, expecting more life under lights later on. The experts pitchside pointed out a decent covering of grass but also the likelihood the ball might not come through quickly. So, yeah, who knows?Elsewhere in Australian cricket, Steve Smith and David Warner came face-to-face at club level in Sydney. South Africa are also unchanged which means Dwaine Pretorius retains his place at seven. Australia will fancy their chances of restricting this Proteas XI to a manageable total. Australia stick with the winning XI from Adelaide, but we’re told there will be some tweaks to the batting order, most notably Chriss Lynn is set to open the innings.For the first time this series South Africa will bat first. This will be a massive test for that far from flawless batting line-up. Good afternoon one and all and welcome to Hobart for live OBO coverage of the third and final ODI of this Australia vs South Africa series. Play will be underway at Blundstone Arena at 1.50pm local time (2.50am GMT).Despite being second best in three of the four innings played so far between these sides Australia arrive in Tasmania in sight of a morale boosting series victory. The bowling performance under Adelaide Oval’s lights has lit a spark under Australian cricket, offering some welcome hope after an annus horribilis. Key to that successful defence of just 231 on Friday was Marcus Stoinis and the allrounder revealed the mental toll of the chaos that has enveloped Australian cricket recently. “The amount of noise going on, people are drained,” Stoinis explained after his player of the match performance. “We’re cooked right now and we just won. Maybe that is part of it, the mental drain. That is what we have got to work on, that is what we have got to get past.”Australia’s batting woes ahead of next year’s World Cup are well documented and again in Hobart selectors will be hoping one of the top order puts up their hand for a regular gig. Chris Lynn and Glenn Maxwell in particular will be under the spotlight with both offering enormous upside when in form but prone to coach-killing dismissals when not. South Africa will be kicking themselves for not wrapping up the series in Adelaide. That they didn’t was courtesy of a poorly handled run chase, one that raises major doubts about their suitability to claim a World Cup, despite possessing a high-quality and well-balanced bowling attack. In mitigation, Hashim Amla and JP Duminy are both missing, but in their absence the make-up of the side looks ill conceived with Dwaine Pretorius at seven and Dale Steyn at eight. In the modern age of consistent scores in excess of 300 and sides keeping attacking for 50 overs regardless of wickets lost, the Proteas look a batting allrounder or two short of the finished article.

The alpha male of his 32-strong group, David is the battle-scarred king of the swingers, although maintaining his status means that every moment is spent sniffing out dissent. If the younger males aren’t beating seven bells out of each other, they are banding together and plotting to dislodge their leader, coming at him with sticks or lobbing clods of earth at his head.Viewers mourning the absence of old-fashioned bloodletting and gore in the autumn schedules should look no further than the new David Attenborough series, Dynasties (Sunday, 8.30pm, BBC One). Not since House Stark crumbled in Game of Thrones have we seen such vicious backstabbing, ruthless power moves and brutish, bruising violence. Just because we don’t see sibling incest doesn’t mean it isn’t happening.Two years in the making, the opening episode follows a gaggle of critically endangered chimps in Senegal where water is scarce and breakfast consists of termites teased out of sandy mounds using grass stems. Theirs is a gritty tale of loyalty, duplicity and the dogged struggle to survive. The burghers of Westeros have nothing on these fearsome beasts. David has been the leader of the group for three years but allies are increasingly thin on the ground and the junior males are restless. No wonder all hell breaks loose when a trio of chimpettes saunter by, their swollen rear ends signalling that they’re ready for some hot lovin’. Far be it for me to pass comment on a person’s downstairs department, but their glistening lady parts resemble a flash sale at Krispy Kreme doughnuts. The young ’uns are keen for some action, but David knows he must be the one to seal the deal. Failing to father the next generation is to confirm he isn’t the ape he used to be and that his power is on the wane.If David is basically Game of Thrones’s Ned Stark, doing good by his family and friends while struggling to assert his authority, the younger, obstreperous male, Luthor, is the odious pipsqueak Joffrey, poised to slaughter his enemies, torture their sons and force himself on their daughters. For every scene featuring a sweetly jug-eared infant, there are 10 more of snarling teens beating up elderly chimps and cooking up a violent coup. Such is the hardship and brutality on display that the occasionally anthropomorphised touches are entirely welcome, although when we are introduced to “an alpha male known as David”, you fully expect a young chimp to swing by shouting: “Oi! Dave, fancy a pint?”Attenborough’s narration delivers harsh truths about life and death in his customary avuncular, seen-it-all tones, all set against a rumbling soundtrack that conspires to make your heart swell one minute, and then smash it to bloody smithereens the next. Shot in eye-watering closeup and unafraid of showing us nature’s cruel underbelly, Dynasties is quite the departure from Planet Earth’s elegant, widescreen splendour.Pull up the drawbridge and ready the direwolves. Winter is coming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32daf35ad8faa93138fe31de8f4441a45bac349f/0_174_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ff49d874221a9176f415f3249520bd9","title":"strictly come dancing week eight live","story":"Nine couples danced it out in the final round before Strictly heads to the Blackpool ballroom.

BLACKPOOL BLACKPOOL BLACKPOOL. So that’s it for another week - thank you all for joining in, I’ll be back tomorrow at 7.50pm for the results, when someone will be hoofed off the bus from Elstree to Blackpool before it’s even made it to South Mimms Services. See you then!I think we may well see Danny and Oti in the dance-off tomorrow, maybe with Graeme and Oti – not bad performances by any stretch, but overshadowed by some really good ones tonight. So how does the leaderboard look? Pashley at the top at usual, and Danny and Amy at the bottom, which is more of a surprise. Lines are open!Time for a recap - some great dancing this week, enjoyed that very much. Faves this week were Lauren and AJ and Stacey and Kevin, but plenty of great dances to choose from.Scores: 8,9, 9,9 - a total of 35 for Charles and Karen. Shirley agrees - a superb ending to a superb show. Bruno thought it was sparkling and squeaky clean, without a smudge - their best dance yet. Craig thought it was too controlled and lacked eccentricity, but Darcey thought it was strong and in sync, and she loved Charles’ crazy fun side. Charle and Karen are cleaning windows, and for some reason Karen has borrowed the Flavia wig. Great footwork from Charles and some strong lifts and tricks – he keeps the energy right to the end and I love the elements of slapstick silliness. Good work, a great finish to a really good show. Also, Charles’ arms. HELLO.And FINALLY, it’s CHARLES AND KAREN! This week they’re dancing the Charleston to ‘No Diggity’ by Minimatic. This is a swing version of the Blackstreet classic, which should absolutely not be allowed.Charles was in the bottom two for the third time last week, which he really didn’t deserve. He could probably do with a week off, so a decent Charleston and some high marks from the judges would be ideal at this point.Scores: 8,8,9,9 - a total of 34 for Lauren and AJ. After those comments, I expected higher. Darcey loved the flow and seamless transitions, although she’d have loved more exaggeration in the top line. Shirley thought it was hugely inspiring and it had the best pivot she’d ever seen. Bruno could hug then both (he does), Lauren gets lovelier and better ever week. Craig felt Lauren was dancing for the first time, absolutely brilliant.Lauren’s dress is entirely dreamy, and I’m already smiling madly. Lauren has improved massively in this competition, and this is a much more confident performance from her – lovely top line and super footwork. Just gorgeous, really loved that - my favourite dance of the night so far. Next up it’s LAUREN AND AJ! This week they’re dancing the Viennese Waltz to ‘You Are The Reason’ by Calum Scott and Leona Lewis. I had no idea these two had collaborated, so I went and had a listen earlier – turns out it’s a rather sweet duet that will one day make a lovely John Lewis Christmas ad, but in the meantime will do for a romantic Waltz.I can’t keep up with all the Blackpool mentions, so just keep drinking. Scores: 7,8,8,9 - a total of 32 for Joe and Dianne.Joe has never been to Blackpool and really wants to go to Blackpool. DRINK. “I love your little face”, says Tess to the 27-year-old man. CAN WE NOT.Well this is quite the rainbow party, and you can’t fault Joe for throwing himself into it. Despite having a frame that resembles a handful of toothpicks, he still manages to deliver some kind of hip action and rotation, and a very decent amount of rhythm. He’s got great timing too, and this is identifiably a Samba, albeit a slightly spiky one. I actually really enjoyed that. It’s time for JOE AND DIANNE! This week they’re dancing the Samba to ‘MMMBop’ by Hanson. Ooh a second Samba in one week. Strictly, how you spoil us. I’m already worrying about the Dave Arch Singer who is going to have to deliver this falsetto, it may require some kind of surgical clamp. So the big question is, can Joe find his Samba hips and Latin party spirit? If he’s got any sense, he’ll have had a few ciders beforehand. I’d be a litre of Thatchers down by now. Scores: 8,8,8,8 - a total of 32 for Stacey and Kevin.Bruno thought Stacey was genuine and natural, and the footwork was great, but Stacey needs to keep the flow through her arms. Craig agrees - Stacey’s upper body needs more expression but a well-studied performance. Darcey loved the routine and Stacey has a natural quality, but every line needs to be finished and she wants to see her in Blackpool (DRINK). Shirley loved the flow at the beginning - Stacey blows her mind every time.

But for 30 years, his southern California constituents have also dubbed him “crazy Dana”.He’s a guy who, in the days of the Soviet Union, signed up for a week to fight alongside the mujahideen in Afghanistan. A guy who, in the early 1990s, got into a drunken arm-wrestling match with a young Vladimir Putin. Putin “put me down in a millisecond”, Rohrabacher recalled years later. “His muscles are just unbelievable.”He’s notorious for making an ill-advised link between “dinosaur flatulence” and global warming for his open disdain of homosexuals and undocumented immigrants for welcoming a notorious Holocaust denier to Washington and for thinking that the Oklahoma City bombing – widely regarded as a conspiracy of homegrown far-right radicals – was an Islamist plot cooked up by Middle Eastern radicals in the Philippines.Not even Rohrabacher’s enemies would deny he is a colorful man. After 15 terms on Capitol Hill, though, he is almost certainly about to be an ex-congressman.“Going forward,” Rouda said in a statement, “my mission is to be the absolute best kind of public servant – honest, transparent, accessible and tireless in serving the greater good.”Rouda’s implication – already voiced in multiple ways on the campaign trail – was that Rohrabacher has been none of these things. It’s certainly true that the once staunchly conservative 48th district along the Orange County coast, an hour’s drive south of Los Angeles, has fallen increasingly out of sympathy with Rohrabacher’s more extreme and eccentric positions.His constituents don’t like his embrace of Donald Trump – they narrowly preferred Hillary Clinton in 2016. They also don’t like his climate change denial, don’t like his cosy relationship with big oil and pharmaceutical companies and, especially, don’t like his repeated and often mystifying alignment with Putin’s Russia.A couple of years ago, Politico dubbed him Putin’s favorite congressman. The moniker has stuck. He defended Russia’s incursion into Georgia in 2008 and the annexation of Crimea in 2014. He has consistently pushed back against sanctions and lobbied to repeal the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which imposed penalties on Russian oligarchs accused of corruption and human rights abuses.So accommodating has Rohrabacher been of Russian military aggression and policy interests that as early as 2012 the FBI warned him the Kremlin was seeking to cultivate him as an intelligence asset and had even assigned him a code name. Ed Royce, then chair of the House foreign relations committee, was alarmed enough to curtail Rohrabacher’s powers as head of the subcommittee dealing with Russia. Last year, the Republican majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, was caught on tape saying he believed Rohrabacher was indeed on Putin’s payroll.Rohrabacher calls that nonsense, and insists he wants only what is best for the US.“You know he’s a tough guy and he’s supposed to be a tough guy, that’s what the Russian people want,” Rohrabacher once said of Putin. “But that’s no reason why we shouldn’t try to work with him.”His questionable Russia ties only brought him fresh notoriety when Trump entered politics and the question first arose of illegal Russian help in winning the 2016 presidential election. Rohrabacher, echoing the president, has dismissed that possibility as “a brouhaha about nothing”. But he, like the president, has also become ensnared in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and is unlikely to shake himself loose just because he is leaving office.Among the contacts that have raised eyebrows:On top of that, Rohrabacher accepted a campaign contribution from Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign manager now cooperating with Mueller following his conviction on multiple charges of tax fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy, and another from George O’Neil, a conservative fundraiser suspected of helping Butina funnel Russian funds into the US electoral system via the National Rifle Association.Rohrabacher’s opponents in both the primary and the general election have pounced on him repeatedly for these connections. The boundaries of his congressional district, they joked, seemed to stretch all the way to the steppes of eastern Europe.In response, Rohrabacher suggested the issue was overblown.“My constituents couldn’t care less about this,” he told the New York Times last year. “They are not concerned about Russia. They are concerned about the taxes on their home. They are concerned about illegal immigrants coming into their neighborhood and raping people.”It appears, though, that events have proved him wrong.“It’s time our elected officials put country and community first,” Rouda told supporters on election night, to cheers and applause. Now it’s Rouda who is heading to Washington, and Rohrabacher who is forced into what is likely to be a less than peaceful retirement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c660dd4cf5c01f4cf3efbfa7cce1ac1d9eb4624d/0_14_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e84d089014e041690b16bad01fb00908","title":"georgia election recount stacey abrams brian kemp","story":"Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp are locked in a dispute amid allegations of voter fraud – something that has plagued Georgia in its historyGeorgia’s hard-fought and bitter governor’s race still isn’t over.Nor was it just a gubernatorial campaign pitting rightwing Trump acolyte Brian Kemp against insurgent Democrat Stacy Abrams and her bid to become the first African American woman governor in US history. Instead it was a battle years in the making, and it was not so much about who to vote for – but who could vote at all.Kemp has declared victory and handed in his resignation as secretary of state – the very office that oversees this contentious election. The outgoing governor Nathan Deal, has declared him the victor.There’s just one catch.Abrams’ campaign team is still counting the votes. Her campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, said from the campaign headquarters Thursday: “All of the votes in this race have not been counted. All the voters of Georgia deserve to be counted before the now-former secretary of state announces his victory.”According to a statement posted on the Georgia secretary of state’s website while Kemp was still in that role, counties have until 9 November to verify provisional ballots and until 13 November to certify the results.After Kemp’s resignation, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People president Derrick Johnson released a statement, filled with refrains echoed by other legal experts, civil rights figures and Kemp’s adversaries during and prior to the election.He said: “Kemp’s actions during the election were textbook voter suppression. His actions were strategic, careless and aimed at silencing the voting power of communities of color in the state.”Consider these numbers.• In the three months leading up to election day, more than 85,000 voters were purged from rolls under Kemp. During 2017 a huge 668,000 voters were purged, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.• Of those 2017 numbers, investigative reporter Greg Palast told Salon, 200,000 people left the state, died or moved out their district, making them legitimate cancellations. However, through litigation, he got the entire purge list. “Of the 400,000 who supposedly moved, our experts will tell a court that 340,134 never moved – wrongly purged,” Palast told the , saying people had been purged for not voting in an election or two.• Furthermore from 2012 to 2016, 1.5 million voters were purged – more than 10 percent of all voters – from records, according to a 2018 report from the Brennan Center for Justice. In comparison, 750,000 were purged from 2008 to 2012.Kemp took office in 2010 and he and fellow conservatives argue the law requires ineligible voters who move or die to be cleared from rolls. But voting rights advocates say the removals disproportionately affect groups who tend to vote at lower rates, like minorities and low-income voters – the same groups who generally support Democrats.It’s a fundamental problem that stretches back into the history of Georgia and the wider south where racial tensions and the fight over who can vote persists from the days of civil rights struggles.Sophia Lakin, a staff attorney on the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, points to the fact that until 2013 Georgia was covered by a section of the Voting Rights Act that stipulated it submit election changes to get “pre-clearance” from the federal government – a protection meant to protect minority voters.She said: “It was a hugely important part of maintaining fair voting practices in places in this country that had a long history of discriminating on racial grounds.”But with those protections now gone for the last five years – that covers Kemp’s period in office – many activists say minority voting rights have been threatened again.Legally, it has been lawsuit after lawsuit in Georgia.Before the 2016 general election, Common Cause, a nonpartisan grassroots organization, and the NAACP filed a lawsuit against Kemp, seeking an injunction to block Kemp from more voter purges based on a registered voters’ failure to vote.Voter purges aren’t the sole concern for critics of the conservative, Trump-endorsed candidate.Abrams’ team also claims the race is too close to call because of other forms of voter suppression lobbied by her adversaries – all ones that could have cost her the governorship.Days before early voting began, a civil rights group sued Kemp “over the state of Georgia’s discriminatory and unlawful ‘exact match’ voter suppression scheme”, resulting in 53,000 pending voter registration applications which they claimed affected mostly minority voters.The “exact match” policy is when a voter’s application has to match – without an errant dash, space, hyphen or period, for example – the information listed in social security or driver’s license databases. On the first day of early voting, a bus full of African American senior citizens on their way to a voting center were turned back. Organizers called it “live voter suppression”.A few days before the election a white supremacist group released racist – and fake – robocalls impersonating Oprah Winfrey, just as she arrived in metro Atlanta to stump for Abrams.Then there was the announcement Kemp was looking into unfounded hacking allegations against Democrats just two days before the election.On election day, Abrams’ fears seemed to come true. witnessed long lines in various parts of metro Atlanta, where the majority of counties lean Democrat. MIT’s Election Performance Index for 2016 suggested Georgia ranked 49th out of 50 for wait times to vote.In the state’s second largest, hotly contested – and traditionally Republican but becoming Democratic – Gwinnett County, an entire polling location at Annistown elementary school was offline when the doors opened at 7am. The county cited issues with the express polling machines that make the electronic ballots, said Joe Sorensen, a county official who showed up at noon.The NAACP sued successfully to keep two polling precincts near the historically black colleges Spelman University and Morehouse College open until 10pm.“It’s easy to vote and hard to cheat in Georgia,” Kemp said Thursday. But on election day, a local news channel claimed even Kemp had difficulties voting, with his vote card coming up as “invalid”.The current high stakes impasse between the two front-runners is actually a sequel.A similar scene played out in the lead up to the 2014 midterms when Abrams was the then-Democratic minority leader in the Georgia house and Kemp the secretary of state. In an effort to increase voter registration among minorities, young adults and unmarried women, Abrams launched the New Georgia Project. According to the non-partisan organization’s website, the aim was to target more than 700,000 unregistered Georgians who happened to be people of color.Kemp accused the organization of voter fraud. Leaked audio from a Republican breakfast in Gwinnett county, now Georgia’s most erse, recorded Kemp as saying: “You know the Democrats are working hard, and all these stories about them, you know, registering all these minority voters that are out there and others that are sitting on the sidelines, if they can do that, they can win these elections in November.”At the moment, Kemp is holding firm. Since the night of the election, he has said: “The math is on our side.” He implied that the argument over voting in Georgia is over.Abrams disagrees. The Georgia Democratic party filed a lawsuit Thursday to extend the deadline for absentee ballots in Dougherty county, a southern county affected by Hurricane Michael in October.“That’s probably the election for Kemp.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b1ada85b2b4c5f3fe48e21e91fbdd8a4c7d89af/0_53_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3da33feda4c5b23012182cc59f57e390","title":"brazil mudslide rio de janeiro","story":"Three-year-old boy among the 10 confirmed victims after city of Niterói hit by landslideTen people were killed and 11 injured in a mudslide near Rio de Janeiro on Saturday, Brazilian authorities have said.Roberto Robadey, the head of Rio’s civil defence department, told the Globo TV network that the mudslide in the city of Niterói was caused by heavy downpours.

We gave them to Saudi Arabia, to the United States, Germans, French and British, all of them. They have listened to all the conversations in them. They know,” Erdoğan said.The CIA director, Gina Haspel, heard an audio recording of Khashoggi’s death when she visited Istanbul, two sources told Reuters last month. A senior Saudi envoy was also played a recording, a source familiar with the matter said. Erdoğan did not give details of the contents of the tapes on Saturday but two sources with knowledge of the issue have told Reuters that Turkey has several audio recordings.They include the killing itself and conversations pre-dating the operation that Turkey subsequently uncovered, the sources said. These had led Ankara to conclude from an early stage that the killing was premeditated, despite Saudi Arabia’s initial denials of any knowledge or involvement.Saudi Arabia’s prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb has since said Khashoggi’s killing was planned in advance, although another Saudi official said Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the specific operation.

When Italy finally emerged from its crushing triple-dip recession in 2015, Brescia, an important European industrial hub some 50 miles east of Milan, enjoyed uninterrupted growth.But business leaders argue that the budget contains little to spur growth and investment, and will instead lead to an economy based on “handouts”.Pasini said it would also diminish a programme introduced by the previous centre-left government known as Industry 4.0, which is credited with enabling companies to expand and compete in global markets: it provided tax incentives for innovation, training and the purchase of new machinery.Giordano Riello, the founder of three electronics companies in the Veneto region, who has benefited from the programme, said the coalition government lacked long-term economic vision.“What we need is investment in infrastructure, factories and materials … not giveaways to make people happy for only a brief time,” he said. “I’m really afraid to invest in my country right now as there is no future vision. All we have is populism, and you don’t develop with populism.”There are warnings that measures including the so-called dignity decree, introduced in July by the M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, to curtail temporary job contracts and penalise companies that shift production abroad, could have the opposite effect.“The labour market decree makes it much harder to hire temporary workers, yet such contracts are a crucial part of employment,” said Francesco Giavazzi, an economics professor at Milan’s Bocconi University. “As for taxing companies for delocalisation – modern firms try to optimise the value chain by building firms around the world. If you don’t allow them to do that, they will move everything abroad.” The move to lower the retirement age was aimed at making more jobs available to young people, but companies might instead use it as an excuse to reduce labour costs, Giavazzi added.Licia Mattioli, chief executive of the jewellery company Mattioli and a vice-president at Confindustria, the confederation of Italian industry, said the slowing economy was a result of uncertainty as well as anxiety over the costs of servicing the country’s debts.She also criticised the budget for lacking a clear investment strategy, especially for much-needed infrastructure projects. The coalition partners, for instance, are currently locked in battle over TAV, a high-speed rail project linking Italy and France that M5S opposes and the League supports. Mattioli is worried about it being cancelled: “Not only will it mean €9bn worth of investment for our country, but it gives us a high-speed link to Europe.”The looming budget standoff also poses an acute dilemma for the European commission,  of EU law, which rejected Italy’s draft spending plans in a historic moment last month. For long-serving EU officials, the power to reject the budget of the third-largest economy of the eurozone makes a lot of sense – until it actually has to be used.The commission is seen to be in a lose-lose situation: if it rejects the budget again, officials fear it will provide ammunition for the League’s anti-EU crusade being led by the deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini. But allowing the plans to pass would send a message that the EU’s common-currency rules do not matter.The decision to let France and Germany off the hook in 2003 for breaking the eurozone’s fiscal pact is judged to have been a hugely damaging mistake that poisoned relations between large and small eurozone members. So far, the other 18 members of the eurozone have backed the commission against Italy, but that has done nothing to ease the wrangling.In front of the cameras, EU ministers and officials have taken a softly-softly approach, but behind the scenes there is anger about Rome’s spending plans. One senior European source said the fight with the EU was political, and accused Italy’s government of misleading its public by suggesting economic bounty was around the corner.Italy’s budget “is not only a mistake, it is a lie”, the source said. “What Salvini wants to prove is that he is not sticking to the rules.” The source believes the Italian government is seeking to emulate the economic policy of the US, but that it lacks America’s structural economic strengths, such as high productivity and high employment rates.The EU’s Rome-watchers take little comfort from the fact that Italy’s rising bond yields may prove a more effective sanction than decisions by Brussels technocrats. “You can get away with a crisis until the moment the markets say enough is enough,” said a senior EU official.As crunch time approaches, Pasini is urging Italian leaders to take heed of business concerns. “Firstly, Europe is essential for Italy and its industry. I hope our politicians understand this and that we don’t reach a point where the country becomes isolated,” he said. “Secondly, we hope they modify some of this budget.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fedbadad2f4cb0e61f2322420ea0d09670381d6/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c0efd9e9c6b5064772e89209238fd3d","title":"the secret lives of trees what to expect in autumn","story":"It’s the season to get lost in beautiful shades of reds, yellows and oranges – but do you know the science behind these vibrant displays, or the role fungi play in the season?“The trees are in their autumn beauty,” wrote the Irish poet William Butler Yeats. “The woodland paths are dry.” Immersed in rich colour and deliciously crunchy underfoot, a woodland walk in autumn is surely one of the most pleasurable and relaxing activities offered by the British countryside.Yet, those excursions are not always quite as straightforward as they appear. For one thing, British trees are rather complicated in their leaf-shedding habits and really vary according to location – autumn takes a while to arrive across the whole country.In the Scottish Highlands, for instance, the woods of the glens are already steeped in golden yellow as early as mid-September. Their canopies are also susceptible to immediate demolition should an early Atlantic storm pass through.In Derbyshire, many woods can often be cleared of vegetation by late October – yet, at the same date in Norfolk, which is more than 300 metres lower in altitude, there are oakwoods looking as emerald green as they did in midsummer. Come November, many trees seem to have barely cast a leaf.Another interesting thing about that leisurely autumn stroll is the environmental intensity that underpins it. Poet John Keats may have famously called it the “season of mists and mellow fruitfulness”, but it is anything but. What really drives those glorious colours in the trees is the stress of hard work.The element of almost all plants responsible for making summer so green is chlorophyll. But as well as being the miracle worker that turns sunlight to sugar during photosynthesis, chlorophyll is also a precious protein. Before they shed their leaves at the end of season, deciduous trees devote themselves to breaking it down and storing it away for another year.Sugar also plays a part in one of autumn’s most dramatic changes. It reacts with proteins in leaf cells to produce an antioxidant called anthocyanin. It is this red-pigmented agent that supplies the slow-burning glow of British woods. Ironically, the more stressed the trees are, the richer those reds seem to be. Autumn foliage is often more intense, for example, after sharp frosts.Of course, there’s more to the season’s full palate of colour. When you think of the lemon and burnt-biscuit fingers, say, of horse chestnuts, or the dull copper carpet that covers the floor of a December oakwood, those browns and yellows are what happens when a tree’s foliage loses all its chlorophyll.But what really makes autumn such a spectacle is that all these extraordinary colours occur together: so you might get the crimson of London planes colliding with the emerald of holly and ivy, or the scarlet berries of hawthorn and dog rose at the same time as the infinite earth tones of toadstools.Mushrooms may be the most modest player in this infinity of colour, but they supply the other great engine of autumnal change. It is the season when we get to see the extraordinary fruiting bodies, the so-called “toadstools” of fungi. It seems more than coincidence that these bizarre organisms are substantially made from the same stuff as insects – chitin – because, like insects, they have a gift for unexpected appearance. Suddenly they bulb up among tree roots, or emerge out of the heartwood like some chest-bursting creature from Ridley Scott’s Alien.These are the parts that digest the organism’s vegetable diet and then traffic it through the woodland floor. They also play a part in the development and maintenance of the canopy, because fungi in woods forge essential partnerships, whereby the roots of the trees interconnect with what are called mycorrhizal fungi. This link between trees and fungi enables them to share vital nutrients.In a single kilo of woodland soil there can be six miles of hyphae. Beneath an inidual wood, there will be many millions of miles of these fungal networks, and they are at the heart of the extraordinary demolition procedure that is at autumn.Without fungi, the world would be buried in this vegetable junk and life would stagnate for the lack of carbon dioxide.So next time you stroll along a woodland path in autumn with trees changing colour, remember that it’s these incredible underlying, unseen essentials that make everything around us possible."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684184.1541167032!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no more buck passing or dithering dublin needs a new boss","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIllustration: Fuchsia MacAreeThere’s a classic trope in horror films where the protagonist sets aside the norms of rational behaviour and goes down into an unlit cellar, or gets into a car with an obviously unhinged stranger, while the audience can see the terrible event about to unfold and are willing the victim to retreat.It’s a feeling that will be familiar to any long-time observer of Dublin local authority proceedings. Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach to attend Armistice Day ceremonies with world leaders at Arc de Triomphe in ParisEvent to mark 50th anniversary of civil rights movement hears key issues unchangedFile to be prepared for Director of Public Prosecutions while investigation continuesMinister for Agriculture Michael Creed pays tribute to work of organisationWoman in her 70s thrown to the ground and her husband grabbed by the throatTom Kettle and Willie Redmond among 26 barristers who died in WW1D\u0026rsquoArcy says high cost of insurance due to large court payouts is \u0026lsquohuge societal issue\u0026rsquoGreen Party legislation would help 500 Bord na M\u0026oacutena workers set to lose jobs in midlandsMartin Doyle will be remembered by the British government with a paving stoneNew book detailing lives in the midst of Dublin\u0026rsquos housing crisis in releasedDetectives recover cannabis resin, cannabis herb, cocaine and ecstasy in Passage WestFlammable liquid was poured through letterbox of front door of house in East BelfastDispute between the NI Police Ombudsman and Durham Constabulary has deepenedAfricans \u0026lsquothe most disadvantaged\u0026rsquo group in the Irish labour market, according to ESRIGalway events will commemorate 1,400 men from county who died in WWIJulie O\u0026rsquoReilly becomes 19th woman caught up in CervicalCheck controversy to dieMay\u0026rsquos letter \u0026lsquoraises alarm bells\u0026rsquo for those who value the integrity of the union, says FosterArlene Foster accuses British PM of breaking promises over proposal for Northern IrelandGraham Love resigned as HEA boss amid frustration over \u0026lsquorisk\u0026rsquo faced by collegesThe well-known figure is remembered as an \u0026lsquoincredibly hard worker and a great friend\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3692556.1541788287!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit downing street rejects dup s betrayal claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP leader Arlene Foster with UK prime minister Theresa May. Photograph: Charles McQuillanPA WireDowning Street has rejected claims that British prime minister Theresa May is preparing to “betray” the Democratic Unionist Party by accepting a backstop that could leave Northern Ireland under different customs and single market rules to the rest of the United Kingdom.In a letter to DUP leader Arlene Foster and her deputy, Nigel Dodds, Mrs May said she could not accept that there would be any circumstances in which a Northern Ireland-specific customs backstop could be allowed to come in to force.“The prime minister’s letter sets out her commitment, which she has been absolutely clear about on any number of occasions, to never accepting any circumstances in which the UK is ided into two customs territories. The government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland,” a Downing Street spokesman said.Ms Foster said she interpreted the letter as a signal that Mrs May was ready to accept that there would be Northern Ireland-specific elements in the backstop she is hoping to agree with Brussels.“The prime minister’s letter raises alarm bells for those who value the integrity of our precious union, and for those who want a proper Brexit for the whole of the UK,” she said.Mrs May’s cabinet is expected to meet early next week to consider a draft withdrawal agreement including a compromise proposal on the backstop. If ministers back the deal and EU member states approve it, it could be signed off at a special EU summit in late November.Downing Street has consistently maintained that a UK-wide customs backstop would remove the need for a Northern Ireland-specific backstop. But the prime minister’s letter makes clear that the backstop will include Northern Ireland-specific requirements for regulatory alignment with the EU.The DUP’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said Mrs May was guilty of a “total betrayal” of promises she made to ensure that there would be no border in the Irish Sea after Brexit. Mr Wilson made clear that the DUP’s 10 MPs at Westminster could not vote for a Brexit deal that included such a backstop.The prime minister’s prospects of winning a parliamentary majority for a Brexit deal dimmed further on Friday when Jo Johnson resigned as transport minister and called for a second referendum. Mr Johnson, whose brother Boris was one of the leaders of the Leave campaign in 2016, said Britain was “barrelling towards an incoherent Brexit” that would leave the country trapped in a subordinate relationship to the EU.Mr Johnson said that, now that it was clear what leaving the EU actually looked like, British voters should be allowed to make the final choice about how to proceed.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet. On Tuesday, the company announced it would give away $125m-worth (£96m) of the Stellar cryptocurrency as part of a major initiative to encourage its use as a mainstream form of payment.Stellar is currently not even in the top five cryptocurrencies in terms of its total value, according to CoinMarketCap, but while it may be lesser-known, its backers say it is more technologically advanced and better suited to large-scale usage.\u0026nbspethereum cryptocurrency has a market cap of around $22\u0026nbspbillion (Getty Images)Another cryptocurrency that could see massive gains in the coming months, some experts say, is bitcoin\u0027s closest rival ethereum.

In the first half of 2018, 2,692 shops closed, while 1,569 opened – leading to a net loss of 1,123. The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The European Commission – the heart of the Brussels empire, the “EUSSR”, – was always going to project a weak economic future for the UK post-Brexit, wasn’t it?A\u0026nbspgroup led by the malevolent Jean-Claude Juncker was\u0026nbspalways going to show the remaining 27 nations of the EU prospering while Britain, out of the club, stumbles helplessly.Such is the conspiratorial temper of our times that such reactions to the latest forecasts from the commission, showing precisely that, are sadly inevitable.UK set for weakest growth in Europe, European Commission warnsBut it’s still a silly conspiracy. For the commission’s forecasts for the UK are not, in fact, wildly different from those of others.The commission sees UK growth in 2019 of a paltry 1.2 per cent. The most recent average forecast from a range of UK forecasters – UK banks and economic consultancies – is growth of 1.4 per cent.That would leave us with faster projected growth than Italy – but still below every other EU economy.It’s true that the Office for Budget Responsibility in last week’s Budget projected growth of 1.6 per cent next year. But this was mainly due to the boost to demand from the chancellor’s extra spending on the health services and his income tax cuts. The OBR expects growth to fall back in 2020 to 1.4 per cent.The idea that the commission has produced some ridiculously pessimistic outlier forecasts for the UK doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.The commission thinks growth in the eurozone and the EU will slow down too in 2019, but not to the extent that it will in the UK.There’s another vital piece of context. The commission’s forecasts – like those of the OBR – are based on the presumption of a smooth Brexit next year, where we secure a withdrawal agreement and remain in the single market and customs union until the end of 2020.The weakness in almost all forecasts essentially reflects assumptions that the UK economy is slowing due to weakening household demand, feeble business investment and lacklustre exports.That may, or may not, be borne out.But in a sense it’s a red herring when thinking about the economics of Brexit.The really important forecasts to bear in mind are those of a severe economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit and long-term damage to our potential growth rate as a result of a Brexit in which we leave the single market and customs union.On this credible economists and forecasters are united.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Shoppers are increasingly staying home and ordering online“Help,” cried the retail industry.No wonder. Ten years ago this month Woolworths went pop. Dark clouds seem to have been bubbling and spitting over the high street ever since. That was underlined by a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the professional services firm, showing that a net 1,123 stores vanished from Britain’s top 500 high streets in the first six months of this year.\u0026nbspThe numbers probably won’t surprise anyone given the high-pocalypse we’ve witnessed among some of retail’s biggest names this year, including the likes of Toys ‘R’Us, Maplin, Poundworld and House of Fraser.\u0026nbspBritish high street is losing 14 shops a day, new research showsTowns with ‘unhealthy’ high streets have lower life expectancyWhy the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenHowever, closures have actually been outstripping new openings since 2010, and the gap is widening.Of course, the British Retail Consortium steamed in with a call for the government to take urgent action on business rates, beyond the tinkering contained in the chancellor’s recent budget.\u0026nbspThe levy is linked to property values and so hits bricks and mortar operators a lot harder than online outfits, which run their operations from out of town in places where you can buy land for a handful of coppers and a Mars bar.\u0026nbspIt has become the industry’s bête noire, and the trade body wouldn’t be doing its job if it didn’t make a fuss about it. But even if you completely eliminated it, the trend would likely continue, albeit perhaps at a slower rate.Britain\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspembraced internet shopping like almost no other nation, and that isn’t changing.\u0026nbspIt’s so much more convenient to have the retailer come to you\u0026nbspwhen the alternative is\u0026nbspslogging around the high street trailing children who’d rather be somewhere else and hoping you get finished\u0026nbspbefore the traffic wardens notice\u0026nbspyour car is illegally parked. Doubly so\u0026nbspif\u0026nbspyou’re time poor. Most Britons are. We\u0026nbspwork some of the longest hours in Europe.\u0026nbspPwC’s head of retail, Lisa Hooker, pointed out to me that 20 per cent of non food items are now bought online. The number is set to increase to 30 per cent by 2021. That says it all.So does this mean the high street is in terminal decline? Are the debates over its future worthless?\u0026nbspNot necessarily. Hooker made note of the fact that all the reliable surveys show that there is still a demand for bricks and mortar shops.\u0026nbspConsumers\u0026nbspjust use them less than they used to, and they want them to operate differently, alongside and as a complement\u0026nbspto their online excursions.\u0026nbspThat means the future will have to be made up of smaller premises that operate as mini showrooms, alongside “experience”\u0026nbspretailers such as vape shops and ice cream parlours, which have been doing well. As have\u0026nbsp(hooray!) book and record shops, which have been\u0026nbspmaking a come back.Encouraging short term “pop up”\u0026nbspstores to open temporarily\u0026nbspalongside them them could help\u0026nbspdraw people in.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

We now need urgent action.“Our analysis shows that if the Government were to take a 50 per cent\u0026nbspstake then there would be a net benefit to the public purse, so there really is no excuse not to.”Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said Labour supports Moorside as they see nuclear as a key part of the UK’s energy mix, but said the government should have stepped in to support it.A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said Toshiba’s withdrawal was “entirely a commercial decision”.“Nuclear has an important role to play as part of the UK’s erse energy mix as we transition to a low-carbon economy, but in each case projects must provide value for money for consumers and taxpayers,” they said.“This government remains committed to new nuclear through the Industrial Strategy Nuclear Sector Deal as well as consenting the first new nuclear power station in a generation at\u0026nbspHinkley Point C.”Critics of nuclear power said the government should see the new circumstances\u0026nbspas an opportunity to move away from nuclear to cheaper technologies such as wind and solar power.“Shifting away from expensive, complicated technology towards cheaper and easier-to-build renewables gives the UK the opportunity to build an electricity system that will keep bills for homes and businesses down for years to come,” said Dr Jonathan Marshall, head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.“Cancelling Moorside does leave a gap in the UK’s decarbonisation plans, but one that is more likely to be filled with the technologies of the future rather than the past.”Additional reporting by PA.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In the first half of 2018, 2,692 shops closed, while 1,569 opened – leading to a net loss of 1,123. The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling dropped more than 0.3 per cent against the greenback to $1.3021, and fell 0.21 per cent against the euro to €1.1471.

While growth for the third quarter on the whole was lifted by 0.6 per cent - the fastest rate since 2016 - economists said this was likely to be a one-off. With “persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters”, according to Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce. Meanwhile, Schroders senior European economist Azad Zangana said the economy is not forecast to pick up in the near term. “We expect UK fourth quarter growth to be very weak as Brexit paralysis truly takes hold,” he said. “Assuming the government can successfully negotiate the withdrawal agreement with Brussels and ratify it in Parliament, then we could see a rebound in growth early next year. “However, a failure to complete a deal which would mean a no-deal or cliff-edge Brexit, is likely to cause a further slowdown in activity, which could be enough to tip the UK into recession.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What’s left? A show that makes breathlessly little sense and is rarely even fun. The people who brought you Walking with Dinosaurs have now brought you Lumbering with Primates. This is less a musical than an amusement park ride perpetually needing repairs, a feat of projection design (Peter England) with occasional dance breaks. (Alexis Soloski)A car wreck of clichés like that simply can’t put a feminist story across meaningfully. Or any story, really — and that’s a bigger problem than the bad score and sluggish 20-foot marionette. I find it hard to believe that the book is by Jack Thorne, who won a Tony Award last season for writing Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. (Jesse Green)I won’t give away details of the beast’s mighty, fatal fall, except to say that it works until it doesn’t. McOnie and Thorne make the mistake of taking the story a beat too far, ending the musical on a note of Ann’s self-empowerment. That’s nice and all, but there’s a big, dead gorilla somewhere out there who isn’t feeling so empowered. King Kong once again turns Disney Princess, when what’s wanted is a Scream Queen. (Greg Evans)The gender politics are an incoherent mix of the old and the new. Ann (Christiani Pitts) is transformed from a passive victim into an ambitious starlet who still has a heart of gold even though she’s willing to compromise her conscience at every turn for the chance of becoming “Queen of New York”. This is the title of one of the show’s highly derivative musical numbers that could be imported directly into the next Forbidden Broadway\u0026nbspspoof.Even when the songs by Eddie Perfect jibe with the story, they rarely make emotional sense. King Kong\u0026nbspdoesn’t simply come up short as a stage translation of a landmark horror film. It actually manages to fit around this failure one of the most ludicrous Broadway musicals in recent memory. (Charles McNulty)King Kong, the creature, is a truly marvellous feat –\u0026nbspof design, of engineering, of choreography, of performers and operators and stage managers functioning at bomb-diffusion levels of precision –\u0026nbspand King Kong, the show is, beyond its spectacle, generic. It’s an amped-up blockbuster with largely forgettable songs, many of them of the belt-and-inspire variety. It’s thunderous and technologically impressive, carefully calibrated to contemporary sensibilities (ie, it’s hooked up to an IV of girl power), and as slick and shiny as an oil spill. As with, say, Space Mountain, the idea is just to go along for the ride. (Sarah Holdren)The truly frustrating thing about King Kong is the waste of it all. Why did this story, whose central figure necessarily cannot sing, need to be a musical at all, much less one that suggests a late-run Simpsons parody? Have the success of War Horse and Thorne’s own Harry Potter and the Cursed Child –\u0026nbspand the bellyflops of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark and Cirque du Soleil’s Paramour –\u0026nbsptaught us nothing? King Kong looks down on its huckster villain, film director Carl (Eric William Morris, overplaying an unplayable role), for taking an awesome creature and surrounding it with mediocrity for a gawking New York audience – but that’s exactly what this production does itself. In the sad eyes of the second act’s chained and stooped Kong, you see flickers of a show that might have been. (Adam Feldman)In a moment before the end of Act 1, Carl\u0026nbsprealizes\u0026nbsppeople won’t believe Kong exists unless they see him with their own eyes. “He’s not a film,” he declares. “I thought about it all wrong — he’s theatre.” It’s a meta moment, because he’s right: The Kong puppet is an impressive feat you’ll need to see for yourself. The rest of the show, though,\u0026nbspdoesn’t command that sort of attention.\u0026nbsp(Jessica\u0026nbspDerschowitz)Created with Sketch.

A largely pointless remake of the classic Ealing comedy, this has some funny moments and Tom Hanks gives a committed performance in the Alec Guinness role – but one can’t help but wonder why they bothered.The film that preceded \u0027The Ladykillers\u0027, this was the siblings’ first job as writers-for-hire. Tapping into a similar vein of screwball comedy to Preston Sturges\u0027s work in the Forties, it has a formidable cast: George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Geoffrey Rush are excellent. Yet this is a rare Coen comedy that does not stand up to a repeat viewing.Audiences felt misled by \u0027Hail, Caesar!\u0027 due to its panoply of Hollywood stars and laugh-heavy trailer. The result was a huge discrepancy in enjoyment between the critics and the punters. A love letter to the golden age of Hollywood, this is one of their lighter efforts, but some of the recreations of film styles of yore are dazzling.This one finds the lads in a playful mood: a spy caper populated with idiotic characters portrayed by the likes of George Clooney, Brad Pitt and John Malkovich (the latter’s pronunciation of “memoir” is a highlight). The plot is less important than the dialogue, characterisation and jokes. Pitt shows a real aptitude for comedy as a dim-witted fitness instructor.Some see \u0027True Grit\u0027 as a poor man’s \u0027No Country for Old Men\u0027, but this is a more faithful adaptation of the Charles Portis novel than the John Wayne version. The Coens, so often accused of cynicism, have rarely produced anything more heartfelt. Hailee Steinfeld, in her breakthrough role, is staggeringly good as a teenager attempting to avenge the murder of her father.There are those who consider this gangster flick — released in the same year as Scorsese’s \u0027Goodfellas\u0027 — to be the Coens\u0027 peak achievement. Slow and contemplative, the film contains two of the greatest moments in the entire Coen filmography: John Turturro in the woods and Albert Finney under the bed. Scorsese would later direct the pilot episode of \u0027Boardwalk Empire\u0027, a television show with more than a hint of \u0027Miller’s Crossing\u0027. The opening 11 minutes of the Coens’ sophomore effort — before the title even appears — is one of the most beautiful, hilarious and perfectly executed sequences in modern cinema. Nicolas Cage didn’t enjoy the experience of making \u0027Raising Arizona\u0027 since the filmmakers allow their actors very little leeway in terms of improvisation. Holly Hunter has rarely been better and this contains some of the funniest Coen scenes.The Coens attempt at a family film (“you know, for kids”) that was expected to make waves at the box office but proved a flop, perhaps partly as a result of its idiosyncratic title. This is a comedy with shades of Sturges and Frank Capra. The flashback involving the tailor might be the most perfect gag in the entire Coen canon.John Turturro stars as Barton Fink, a playwright attempting to write a screenplay in a deserted hotel while wrestling with his demons andor John Goodman. Sharp, with a good dose of pathos, it deservedly won the Palme d\u0027Or in 1991. That the Coens decided to make a film about writer’s block while they themselves were struggling to complete \u0027Miller’s Crossing\u0027 means there\u0027s a personal element to it, too (“I’ll show you the life of the mind, says Goodman\u0027s Charlie Meadows).A favourite with fans, this begins in a 19th-century Eastern European shelter and ends with the disclaimer that “No Jews were harmed in the making of this motion picture”. In between, we are treated to the Coens’ most personal film, pitched somewhere between the \u0027Book of Job\u0027 and Saul Bellow’s \u0027Herzog\u0027. Michael Stuhlbarg is mesmerising as a Minnesotan physics professor who sees his life fall apart in 1967.The title may be a reference to Sullivan’s Travels, and the plot inspired by Homer\u0027s \u0027The Odyssey\u0027, but this is an astonishingly original musical that stands as the most joyous film in the siblings’ filmography. The soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and this sepia-tinted tale of convicts on the run during the Great Depression never fails to lift the spirits.The maverick filmmakers burst onto the scene with one of the most accomplished debuts in the history of the medium. Shot in just eight weeks, this is a startlingly violent neo-noir with moments of pure horror and that streak of bleak fatalism that would become a recurring theme.Quite possibly the film of the decade, \u0027Inside Llewyn Davis\u0027 stars Oscar Isaac as a folk singer struggling to make ends meet in and around the Greenwich Village scene of 1961. For anyone who’s ever embarked on a creative pursuit and was worried that talent alone might not be enough, this is more terrifying than any horror.The Coens most underrated film, \u0027The Man Who Wasn’t There\u0027 was inspired by a poster showing various haircuts from the 1940s that the brothers came across while shooting \u0027The Hudsucker Proxy\u0027.

It was the fourth fatal shooting in the area in recent months\u0026nbspmore than three dozen builders had died in a series of attacks, with the Baloch Liberation Front, a group seeking an independent Balochistan,\u0026nbspbeing\u0026nbspheld responsible.The development of Gwadar is a matter of vital importance for a Pakistani government trying to rescue an economy which is\u0026nbspin dire straits. It has\u0026nbsprepeatedly claimed that violence in the area has been brought under control. On a trip to the town two weeks ago, however, my colleagues and I were only allowed to move around under army escort.Huge protests in Pakistan after Christian woman on death row releasedBut separatist strife is not the only issue with\u0026nbspGwadar. The port\u0026nbspis a prominent part of the $60bn\u0026nbsp(£46bn) China-Pakistan Economic Corridor\u0026nbsp(CPRC), which in turn is part of Beijing’s global Belt and Road Initiative,\u0026nbspa massive and\u0026nbspcontroversial mission which has become a huge geopolitical talking point.To the Chinese government and its supporters, the Belt and Road\u0026nbspproject – set to be established in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe,\u0026nbspwith offshoots in Latin America –\u0026nbspis a purely strategic infrastructure programme which will spread trade and the benefit it brings across many lands.To its\u0026nbspgrowing number of detractors, the real aim is to spread Chinese\u0026nbsphegemony using commerce in tandem with the naval bases\u0026nbsp– the\u0026nbsp“String of Pearls”\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspBeijing is building on the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The covert motive, it is claimed, is to spread “debt-trap diplomacy”\u0026nbspby providing finance and then extracting advantage when debtor countries have difficulties paying back. The most notorious example of this so far is Sri Lanka ceding a port, Hambantota, in return for the waiver of $1bn on loans.This is a good time to ask the Saudis for favours, they wouldn’t want to turn anyone away with the bad publicity they are gettingChina is Islamabad’s long-term, staunch backer and is\u0026nbspincreasingly important – especially as a previous ally, the US, is now courting India, the country with which Pakistan has been locked in rivalry since both states became free from British colonial rule more than seven\u0026nbspdecades ago.There is also the crucial economic factor:\u0026nbspPakistan is greatly in need of money from its friends. Two weeks ago, the country’s new prime minister, Imran Khan told The Independent\u0026nbspin an interview about the stark reality of the financial situation. While many international political and business leaders had pulled out of an economic forum in Riyadh following the murder of\u0026nbspjournalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, he had to go because, he admitted,\u0026nbsp“We are desperate for money ... The reason I have to take this opportunity is because we are a country of 210 million people and we have the worst debt crisis in our history.” Without funding from abroad, he pointed out, “we actually won’t have in another three months enough foreign exchange to service our debts or pay for our imports.”Imran Khan (second right)\u0026nbspattends\u0026nbspthe opening ceremony of the Future Investment Initiative\u0026nbspin Riyadh last month (AFPGetty)Khan wanted to attract investors at the forum to Pakistan. But the main aim was to secure Saudi largesse. Failure to get funds from the kingdom as well as from China would mean turning to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s 13th bailout – accompanied by\u0026nbspinevitably\u0026nbspharsh strictures on public spending, with the population already suffering from an austerity package.Khan secured a very welcome $6bn\u0026nbspfrom the Saudis after meeting the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the man who has been accused of being complicit in Jamal Khashoggi’s death (though he denies any knowledge). “It sounds callous, I know,”\u0026nbspsaid a senior official in Islamabad, “but this is a good time to ask the Saudis for favours, they wouldn’t want to turn anyone away with all the bad publicity they are getting.”As well as the loan pledge, Pakistan got an agreement for Saudi Arabia to invest in a new oil refinery in Gwadar. A Saudi delegation visited the port and, according to petroleum minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan,\u0026nbsp“showed an interest to immediately invest in the refinery”. The agreement will be signed by the kingdom’s oil giant Aramco and the Pakistan State Oil company, but, he said, “we sat down and held discussions and it was principally decided by both sides that it will be a government to government agreement.”Gwadar can become a strategic port on the edge of the Indian Ocean (Amanda Coakley)This week Khan was on a trip to China during which he sought further funds to add to the $6bn Beijing has loaned Pakistan since last year to prop up its foreign exchange reserves. There were recriminations after Pakistan’s national television channel used a caption saying “begging” instead of “Beijing”. It was due to an unfortunate typographical error, the broadcaster said in its apology.Beijing is expected to acquiesce, but it has also repeated its call on Islamabad to carry out the type of structural reforms the IMF\u0026nbsphad also demanded in response to Pakistan’s latest appeal for help.There has also been annoyance in Beijing at criticism of the Belt and Road\u0026nbspfrom Pakistani officials, including Khan himself when he was in opposition, as well as two officials in his government. Abdul Razzak Dawood, an adviser to the prime minister on commerce, had held that some of the deals made were unfair to Pakistani companies. The railways minister, Sheikh Rashid, has wanted to cut the size of the Karachi-Peshawar rail line, saving $2bn from the $8bn budget.There are also claims, in Pakistan and abroad, that the Belt and Road\u0026nbspis one of the main contributors to Pakistan’s economic problems. Beijing has insisted that Pakistan buy Chinese equipment for projects, which has denuded foreign exchange reserves. Beijing has then extended loans to cover the purchases, which, in turn, has sent debt soaring further.AFPGetty)The IMF has insisted that any loan it gives to Pakistan is not used to pay off the China debt. The organisation’s managing director, Christine Lagarde,\u0026nbsphas stressed\u0026nbspthat there must be “absolute transparency” over this. The US, too, has demanded similar stipulations. Washington has long been hostile towards the Chinese project, charging that Beijing is using it to hold nations in thrall.Relations between the US and Islamabad are at a particularly low ebb\u0026nbspat present, in any case. Successive American presidents have threatened to cut aid to the Pakistani military unless action was taken against the Taliban and other violent Islamist groups which\u0026nbspthe west (and the Afghan government) claim are fed and watered in Pakistan and sent to carry out murderous attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan has always denied the allegation.Donald Trump’s first tweet this year said that the US “has foolishly given Pakistan more than $33bn\u0026nbspin aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies \u0026amp deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools”. The US administration announced in September that it was cutting $300m in aid to Pakistan’s military.The Chinese are concerned by armed insurgency across the border in Balochistan where they have been in confidential negotiations with rebel groups for some time. However, with the Gwadar plan, it is the possibility of being drawn into a wider confrontation, if Saudi Arabian investment\u0026nbspin the port is confirmed,\u0026nbspwhich is a cause of unease.Created with Sketch.

This is especially of concern as China is a major importer of Iranian oil, and has\u0026nbspbegun to invest heavily in Iran –picking up contracts being left behind by western companies pulling out after the reimposition\u0026nbspof sanctions by the Trump administration.Iran has experienced a number of terrorist attacks claimed by Isis which Tehran has blamed, without offering evidence, on Saudi Arabia. The scope for sectarian trouble\u0026nbspspreading to Balochistan was illustrated last month when 14 Iranian border guards were abducted by an extremist Sunni group Jaish al-Adli. Pakistani security forces say they have failed to find the kidnapped men, leading to warnings of action being taken by the Iranians.The Pakistani government has stressed that the Saudi money did not come with political strings attached and, in his interview\u0026nbspbefore he went to Riyadh, Imran Khan spoke of his regret at Mr Trump tearing up the nuclear deal with Iran and pursuing punitive measures against the country.Gwadar is a prominent part of a $60bn\u0026nbspinfrastructure project between China and Pakistan (Amanda Coakley)The prime minister said that Pakistan\u0026nbspwould like to be an intermediary between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Yet the Saudi-led Sunni block were unhappy when the Pakistani parliament, under the previous government, refused to take part in the current war in Yemen. Islamabad was privately warned that it would have to choose sides sooner rather than later. There have long been reports that Saudi Arabia has “bought” a nuclear bomb from Pakistan to act as a counter against a “Shia bomb” produced by Iran – and the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, set up by Riyadh and led by a Pakistani commander, General Raheel Sharif,\u0026nbspprimarily exists to counter Shia forces.According to Theodore Karasik, at Gulf State Analytics, a Washington consultancy firm, “Saudi moves and investments in Pakistan are a set and established policy that seeks to better integrate Islamabad into Riyadh’s camp.”Robert Emerson, a British security consultant, says:\u0026nbsp“China have invested heavily in Pakistan, but it is also engaging in a substantial way commercially with Iran. It is understandable that they do not want to see a Saudi presence imported into Gwadar, just over a 100km\u0026nbspfrom the Iranian border.“But China also now has problems with Belt and Road. There has been consistent opposition from the US, Japan, India and others and now we see some of those countries which were going to take part in it are having second thoughts.”China urged to close mass detention camps for Uighur MuslimsPakistan to plant 10 billion trees to combat decades of deforestationPakistan invites Saudi Arabia to join China’s Belt and Road corridorA number of states, including Malaysia, Nepal and Myanmar have pulled out of Chinese-financed programmes. Recent elections in the Males saw the defeat of the Beijing-backed President Abdulla Yameen under whose rule the nation has accrued $1.3bn debt to China, more than a quarter of its GDP. The opposition – whose candidate, Mohamed Solih, won at the polls\u0026nbsp– had warned of being sucked into a “serious debt trap”.In Colombia there has been widespread local opposition for eight years to the building of the $4bn Ituango dam, part funded by the Chinese, in an area with propensity for landslides. This year 26,000 people had to be evacuated after heavy rainfall led to a landslide environmentalists have been warning about.Saudi moves and investments in Pakistan are a set and established policy that seeks to better integrate Islamabad into Riyadh’s campIt has now been almost a decade since China overtook the US as Africa’s biggest trading partner. Nine countries have signed Belt and Road\u0026nbspagreements with Beijing and 20 others are engaged in talks to do so. The Chinese government pledged $60bn in preferential loans and investments at an economic forum for Africa three years ago.African countries, so far, have been readily receptive to the Chinese loans which have been pouring in. But concerns have been raised too,\u0026nbspwith the Centre for Global Development finding, for instance, that Djibouti, where the Chinese now have a military base, has seen its foreign debt swell from 50 per cent to 85 per cent of GDP with the largest amount by far owed to China. The Chinese company CMPort, the same one which built Hambantota in Sri Lanka, now under Chinese control, is building a port in the country at Doraleh.China also has aspirations for Europe to be the final destination for the land route of the Belt and Road, with the aim that every day trains from Chinese trading cities would arrive at distribution points in Duisburg, Madrid and London.But six months ago 27 out of 28 European Union ambassadors in Beijing\u0026nbspsigned off a report saying the project “runs counter to the European Union’s agenda for liberalising trade and pushes the balance of power in favour of subsidised Chinese companies”.In September, Brussels launched its response to the Belt and Road: the building of infrastructure across Europe and Asia with Federica Mogherini, the head of European Union foreign policy, describing it as the “European way” of connecting the two continents.But the European Union may not remain unified in its approach. The Hungarian ambassador did not sign the report in Beijing and now Britain appears to be keen for China deals. In December last year Philip Hammond, on a visit to Beijing, said, “I was privileged earlier this year to represent the UK\u0026nbspat the first Belt and Road forum and one of the things we will discuss is the opportunity for closer collaboration in delivering the ambitions of the Belt and Road programme.”Like Imran Khan’s Pakistan, Theresa May’s post-Brexit Britain cannot ignore Beijing at a time of economic hardship, however the true cost of this Chinese connection will\u0026nbspunfold in the future.belt and roadShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He spent his youth surfing on the margins of society, before floundering\u0026nbspon\u0026nbspthe seas\u0026nbspof a troubled marriage. Since then, he has taken up the only\u0026nbspsensible function now left open to him – to offer opinions on everything under the sun. By Andy MartinClick to followThe IndependentThe prince’s purpose flows from his inability to quite fit into time and spaceIt wasn’t quite a\u0026nbsproyal wave. More like a royal glance. To be honest,\u0026nbspI might have waved, or possibly saluted, or at least stood to attention. Not long ago, the Queen drove right past me in her Regal Roller on Lisson Grove. Lots of police outriders and suchlike. A chauffeur of course. But I saw her and she saw me. Then she took a right on Rossmore Road and she was gone. But she had bestowed upon me the royal gaze for a fleeting instant. So I know she’s real and, more importantly, so am I. There was a mutual confirmation of existence. Which was strangely reassuring.But where does Prince Charles fit into this great unreality show? The answer is that he doesn’t. Not really. He is, and always will be, the odd man out. And that may well be his saving grace. It is a little-known fact that the young Prince of Wales was once a surfer and a windsurfer.\u0026nbspA fugitive from landlocked society. But even right out on the margins he was always marginal. More of a wannabe.He definitely got wet a few times\u0026nbspand was to be seen, all too briefly, walking on water.\u0026nbspI know that for a while, back in the late 1970s, he was even president or patron of the British Surfing Association and held a reception for the British surfing team before they left to compete in South Africa. He made some remark about a lot of the surfers having abundant moustaches and were they for the purpose of keeping you warm in the water? Not exactly Oscar Wilde, but good try, your royal highness.We know that the heir apparent was no fan of the cold showers at Gordonstoun. Maybe he even started surfing in Scotland. But\u0026nbspit was at Cambridge that he attained the zenith of his theatrical career with brief appearances on stage as an eccentric prince of some kind. He was either in a dustbin or was wearing dustman’s kit. He always said his inspiration was the Goons (Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, and Harry Secombe), and knew “The Ying Tong\u0026nbspSong” off by heart, but even the most benevolent reviewers of the period would have to conclude that he was a Goon manqué.It was while at university that the idea got about that he had several butlers constantly in attendance, one for the royal toothbrush, another for buttoning the royal waistcoat and what not. This still seems\u0026nbspunlikely, given the limited accommodation, even at Trinity College. I saw him wandering the streets with his security guy way back when. No sign of Jeeves plural then anyhow. The flunkeys story probably got mythified out of all proportion. Clearly he has them. Actual stats hard or futile to ascertain.1948 Charles is born.

Kim Jong-un takes over in North Korea2012 Evidence for the Higgs\u0026nbspboson is discovered2017 Inauguration of Donald Trump2018 The prince’s 70th birthdayMaybe he should have become a serious historian. He would almost have fitted in amid the aggressively non-conformist refuseniks of the Senior Common Room. But didn’t he get a lower second? I guess that ruled him out. Shame really.He had his military period, like his old dad, but he never really took to life on the ocean wave, any more than to surfing. His career as Top Gun ended when he crashed a plane and had to be grounded for his own safety. But he still looked good in a uniform. So he thought he’d give marriage a shot. It was always going to be on the agenda at some stage. Future king has to think of passing on the baton at some point, always assuming someone has passed the baton on to him of course.Diana: she looked the perfect fairytale bride. A match made for global television. The prince and the princess. Sometimes one regrets that life does not resemble a fairytale in almost any particular. Unless, that is, the phrase “living happily ever after” can be taken to include mutual indifference, rancour, animosity, affairs galore, escapades of all sorts, falsehoods and confessions. James Dean argued that it was necessary to live fast, die young and be a good-looking corpse. It’s more glamorous, more Hollywood. So it could be that Charles missed his shot there too.Perhaps he was just not that cut out for marriage after all. Not everyone is. Perhaps no one. Why should he be more than another? He had a go at lover. Tried his hand at the difficult genre of the erotic utterance. Maybe he should have revised his Liaisons dangereuses beforehand.Having spent a certain amount of time floundering in his sea of troubles, far from the shores of public affection, Charles paddled back in with a degree of enlightenment and therefore took up the only sensible function now left open to him, a job with no known required qualifications, that of philosopher royal. His task was to offer opinions on everything under the sun.He succeeded in demolishing – theoretically – most modern architecture, anything after about 1900, but especially tall buildings, of which there are quite a few these days. He had a good point of course. He often does. Glass carbuncles were never going to be that popular.In the letters that have come to be known as the “black spider memos” he offered his advice to any number of ministers about matters ranging from homeopathy to foreign affairs. Which, technically, he is entitled to do. The sad thing is that, so far as can be determined, no one took any notice of him. Or perhaps did the exact opposite.Inspired by his old mentor, Laurence van der Post, he became a farmer-ecologist-conservationist. To be honest,\u0026nbsp his produce in Waitrose\u0026nbspis very\u0026nbspgood. The organic pears taste\u0026nbsplike pears of yore. Crunchy yet juicy. The “Duchy” business model is probably about as relevant as Disneyland to the state of agriculture as a whole, because the finances are all out of whack. After all, to some extent we\u0027re\u0026nbsppaying for the pears twice (and they weren’t cheap anyway)\u0026nbspbecause we are\u0026nbspsupporting the royal family through\u0026nbsptaxes. In that sense, Prince Charles has given the idea of living off the land a whole new meaning.Created with Sketch.Royal wedding ceremonies: through the years in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Royal Wedding - Harry and Meghan, 2018Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex emerge from the West Door of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle after their wedding ceremony240 Royal Wedding - Edward and Alexandra, 1863Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward  VII), and his bride, Princess Alexandra of Denmark, after their wedding340 Royal Wedding - Princess Patricia and Commander Alexander Ramsay, 1919Princess Patricia of Connaught, driving from Westminster Abbey, with her husband Commander Alexander Ramsay, after their wedding ceremony440 Royal Wedding - Elizabeth and Albert,1923Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later to be Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother) and Prince Albert, Duke of York (later to be King George VI) on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after their wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey540 Royal Wedding - Prince Henry and Lady Alice, 1935The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester on their wedding day.

Which would depend on the next generation moving out of the way. It’s not a good position to be in. It makes you think too much of those Snoopy cartoons where he is being a vulture in a tree, poised to swoop. It works in the cartoon though.Even if Charles is hemmed in by senior members of his family on one side and the upcoming juniors threatening to overtake him, I still have doubts as to whether Charles is that impatient to be king. Charles, as a historian, has read his Walter Bagehot, the great theorist of the British constitution (which does not in fact exist).Judi Dench, Tim Minchin, Harriet Walter, David Tennant and Paapa Essiedu\u0026nbspas part of a special production of Shakespeare Live! from the RSC in\u0026nbsp2016 (Getty)He knows that the role of the monarch is to be the “decorative” or “dignified” part of the constitution. I still can’t see that happening. According to Bagehot, the monarch enjoys three rights, “the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.” Charles will still stick his oar in, in other words, but the reality is that he will be more constrained as king than as prince. The Prince of Wales – and there is no shortage of precedent here – can get away with just about anything and he’s still prince. The prince is virtually obliged to misbehave. The king, on the other hand, is required to be kingly. He doesn’t get to write so many letters, erotic or otherwise. He would effectively have even less power than he has now.Is Charles up to the job? The job-that-is-not-a-job. Charles wants to be king but knows that he never quite can be, even if he is. What\u0026nbsphas proved to be endearing about Charles and strikes a universal note is that he is still looking for the thing he is really good at. He has had a go at just about everything and has succeeded brilliantly in the realm of failure. The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described a man as being someone who is not what he is and is what he is not. I’m still not sure what that means exactly but Prince Charles seems to exemplify this uncertain and paradoxical status to a high degree.\u0026nbspPrince Charles feels \u0027regret\u0027 at being \u0027deceived\u0027 by paedophile bishopBahraini royal sued for £35m in UK over deal to meet Bollywood starsJapan’s Princess Ayako gives up royal title as she marries ‘commoner’ He once – briefly – had a go at Hamlet, on stage, with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He\u0026nbsputtered probably the single most famous line in all tragedy:\u0026nbsp“To be or not to be, that is the question” – putting a crazy over-emphasis on the final word. And Charles himself is more of a question than an answer, an enigma inside an anomaly. King of infinite space or quintessence of dust?He is not too sure. Who are you?” a child once asked him. “I wish I knew,” he replies, in a Jonathan Dimbleby documentary.\u0026nbspA prince with a touch of imposter syndrome. He is, after all, only the “apparent” heir and fears that the real one may yet pop up and take his place. Charles makes me think of someone who is always a bit betwixt and between, a round peg in a square hole, neither one thing nor another, but still, all the same, continuing to give of his best and give it a decent shot anyway. He is, you have to say, a trier.The black spider letters were once memorably described as being “as controversial as back copies of the Beano” (credit to Stephen Glover in the Mail). I have to admit, though, to a sneaking affection for the Beano. And, similarly, for those great old double-breasted suits of his, and his archaic way of speaking, all of that, in a spirit of nostalgia. Which suggests why he was never really going to make it as a surfer – he prefers to swim against the prevailing current.The first Charles took that too far and ended up with his head on the block, but if you had to pinpoint a king who looks like some kind of plausible precursor, it would have to be King Canute, sticking his throne down in the sand and trying to hold back the tide.\u0026nbspWe know that he has passed on his board to Prince Harry, who once went surfing in Cornwall. Maybe he will take over as president of the British Surfing Association.Terry Eagleton once said of the Prince of Wales that “he wants the kind of change radical enough to do away with polluters and modernist architects, but not radical enough to do away with himself”. But what he wants or doesn’t want is not really the point. If modern capitalism is all about “creative destruction”, then the feudal principle (and primogeniture) he embodies stands as a kind of counterweight or counterpoint to transience, a symbol of persistence or resistance (even if manifestly unfair and absurd). In the age of information and Donald Trump, he looks like someone who wouldn’t be well-equipped to tweet in the middle of the night. On the other hand, he could probably speak up for Gaia and communing with trees in a way that the average world leader might well shy away from.The prince’s purpose flows from his inability to quite fit into time and space.\u0026nbspWhether willingly or not, he has become the representative of all those (which is everyone, at one time or another) who feel rejected or excluded or left out in the cold or just waiting for a door to open that remains stubbornly closed. His charitable endeavours, on behalf of refugees and other fugitives from fate, reflect this role. Prince he may be, but he is already king of an immense and populous realm, the great and lonely kingdom of outsiders.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It\u0027s very much a continuation of the styling OnePlus used on the OnePlus 6 earlier in the year. That was the first to break with the metal-back styling of phones since the OnePlus 3 and opt for a glass enclosure front and rear.\u0026nbspThis looks as smart and stylish as the last model – which is very stylish, by the way –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspalthough it\u0027s a little thicker from front to back (8.2mm instead of the OnePlus 6\u0027s 7.8mm), it feels very comfortable in the hand, not least because it\u0027s narrower than the last model.Still, it squeezes in a bigger 6.4-inch display\u0026nbspbecause the screen proportions are different: This is a 19.5:9 ratio screen. There\u0027s a notch at the top, but it\u0027s pretty minimal, like a drop of water when it\u0027s just about to gain enough critical mass to drip from the bathroom tap, no bigger than that. It looks cute.This teardrop notch is one obvious change. The second comes when you flip the phone over. Unlike on the OnePlus 6, there\u0027s no fingerprint sensor just below the dual cameras.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

Pick up the phone and the fingerprint icon lights up on the dark screen. Touch it, and it responds with a neat animation, like a fizzing electrical sphere, and unlocks to the home screen. It feels like the future.Huawei has a similar technology, though a less glitzy special effect, on the Huawei Mate 20. Huawei\u0027s feels just that bit quicker, but this is far from slow. It\u0027s not as fast as a conventional fingerprint sensor, but at least there\u0027s the cute animation to entertain you –\u0026nbspand it\u0027s still only a fraction of a second.Also, it sits in just the perfect place, right at the bottom of the display, in the middle, while the Mate 20 Pro sensor is quite a bit higher.That other Chinese brand, Xiaomi, also has an in-screen fingerprint sensor on its new Mi 8 Pro handset, though that requires a little more pressure.Top tip: when you\u0027re enrolling your fingerprint, think about what angle you\u0027ll actually be unlocking it from. My vertical thumb print wasn\u0027t very effective. I registered it again coming at it from the angle that it turns out I would actually pick the phone up by and it worked like a dream.OnePlus has beaten smartphone heavyweights Apple and Samsung to introduce an in-screen fingerprint sensor (OnePlus)Overall, the fingerprint unlock is pretty reliable, though it doesn\u0027t work as consistently as, say, Face ID on the iPhone XS. But it does the job more than nine times out of ten, so enough to keep you coming back to it rather than turning to the other ways to unlock the phone, such as facial recognition (consistent but not as much fun) or tapping in a PIN code.When it unlocks, you get to see the display in all its glory. It covers 86 per cent of the front of the phone. You can even obscure the notch if you want, or at least set it so the display colours itself black on either side of it, so it blends in. But with such a pretty notch, why would you hide it? Well, only because it gives the screen a little more symmetry, near-matching bezels at top and bottom, it suddenly looks like.The 6.41-inch display on this phone is bright and colourful, looking eye-searingly vivid in some wallpapers (which I love the look of, by the way). The wallpapers even bear the OnePlus slogan of Never Settle, a reminder of the plucky Chinese brand\u0027s positive attitude.It\u0027s a pin-sharp OLED screen, with 401 pixels per inch, that\u0027s the same as the iPhone 8 Plus and rather more than the iPhone XR. And it has OnePlus specialities like reading mode which turns the screen monochrome as though it were a Kindle.\u0026nbspIt completely dominates the front of the phone and you\u0027ll be glad to know it\u0027s robust –\u0026nbspit\u0027s made of Gorilla Glass 6.OnePlus mobile phones are seen on display during a press briefing in Mumbai, India, July 31, 2018 (REUTERSFrancis Mascarenhas)As far as the rear of the phone is concerned, there are two finishes to choose from, Midnight Black (it means matte black) and Mirror Black (it means, oh, you can work it out). Both are attractive.One of the most interesting things about the design is what\u0027s not there:\u0026nbspThe headphone jack. OnePlus is hardly alone in dropping this connection but nonetheless it\u0027s something that many fans have not been happy about, not least because the company championed the headphone jack one the OnePlus 6. Mind you, it means the phone has a bigger battery than last time, which on balance, is a decent trade-off.OnePlus hasn\u0027t introduced waterproofing here, either, something which is a real boon in technology generally. So, don\u0027t drop it in the bath. And, be warned, this phone can feel slippy in the hand.Something else that\u0027s absent is wireless charging. Now, scores of phones have had this capability and until recently it\u0027s gone largely unused. But the truth is that wireless charging pads are an unsung hero of the tech world, providing a genuine improvement in convenience that, once used, is hard to give up on.Wireless charging is especially good at disguising limited battery life because the simplicity of putting it on a pad feels much less of a commitment than digging out the right cable and plugging it in.So, although the company hasn\u0027t ruled wireless charging out for future phones, it\u0027s a shame it\u0027s not here now. Especially as the rear of the phone is glass, not metal.\u0026nbspStill, OnePlus prides itself on charging the battery fast, and that\u0027s definitely the case with the OnePlus 6T, which quickly goes from empty to enough to get through a day in around half an hour. That\u0027s part of the argument against wireless charging, of course, that it\u0027s not as fast.Battery life is strong with a full charge leaving you with a third of a battery by the end of the day, often more. As mentioned, this battery is bigger than on the OnePlus 6.Performance is good, too, thanks to the fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip and plenty of RAM to keep everything speeding along. It has the latest version of Android on board, Android Pie 9.0. OnePlus uses its own Oxygen OS set-up which is accessible and attractive.The camera is a crucial element on every smartphone now and I found the OnePlus 6T camera to be a moderate improvement on the last model. The hardware is the same, but algorithms and software have been enhanced to better photograph faces, text, food and night scenes, OnePlus says.The front camera is high-resolution, 16MP, and has similarly had a software uptick to make selfies sharper.The rear camera hardware is good - a pair of sensors with 16MP and 20MP resolution respectively - but sometimes I found the images were low on detail in places. Low light was less of a problem than on many phones but I didn\u0027t feel the camera quite on the level of the best in the market, such as the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and iPhone XS. Then again, those phones cost a lot more.Which is a part of the story for OnePlus. Although the latest phone is not as super-cheap as its handsets were when it first arrived on the scene, the price ticket here, £499, is impressive. Especially since the storage on board is 128GB, where many rivals have 64GB as standard, still.Camera apart, there\u0027s not much you miss out on with this phone (well, wireless charging and a headphone jack but they aren\u0027t dealbreakers) and there are some elements, such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor, which hardly any other phones can match. Add to that the strong performance, great battery life and fast recharge, and the OnePlus 6T is a deeply appealing choice.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling dropped more than 0.3 per cent against the greenback to $1.3021, and fell 0.21 per cent against the euro to €1.1471. Analysts put the dip partly down to the US federal reserve’s indication that it will hike rates in December, which strengthened the dollar. UK economy flatlines in September, official figures showEU heaps pressure on Theresa May ahead of crunch talksThe midterms have only given the US economy a short-term boostThe IFS is right – Philip Hammond took a big gamble with his BudgetHowever, UK economic data also had an impact, with the Office for National Statistics reporting that the economy stagnated in September. While growth for the third quarter on the whole was lifted by 0.6 per cent - the fastest rate since 2016 - economists said this was likely to be a one-off. With “persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters”, according to Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce. Meanwhile, Schroders senior European economist Azad Zangana said the economy is not forecast to pick up in the near term. “We expect UK fourth quarter growth to be very weak as Brexit paralysis truly takes hold,” he said. “Assuming the government can successfully negotiate the withdrawal agreement with Brussels and ratify it in Parliament, then we could see a rebound in growth early next year. “However, a failure to complete a deal which would mean a no-deal or cliff-edge Brexit, is likely to cause a further slowdown in activity, which could be enough to tip the UK into recession.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Eventually we could even use the technology to navigate ourselves, as we\u0027re on a path towards miniaturising\u0026nbspit\u0026nbspto the point it could fit in a smartphone.minitiarisation has already begun that could eventually see one fit in a smartphone (Imperial College London)The device represents the UK\u0027s first commercially viable\u0026nbspquantum accelerometer, which is a far more advanced version of the sorts of accelerometers that currently exist in today\u0027s mobile phones and laptops.The idea of using accelerometers for navigating is not a new one – as they\u0026nbspmeasure\u0026nbsphow quickly the speed of an object is changing in time –\u0026nbspthough until now accelerometers have not been accurate enough to match other technologies like\u0026nbspGPS.The quantum accelerometer relies on the precision and accuracy made possible by measuring properties of super-cool atoms, which means any loss in accuracy is immeasurably small.Dr Joseph Cotter, from the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial, said: “When the atoms are ultra-cold we have to use quantum mechanics to describe how they move, and this allows us to make what we call an atom interferometer.”CenterHandout via REUTERS)Real-world applications for the device could first be seen in the shipping industry, as it offers a solution to some of the issues presented by GPS\u0026nbspnavigation.We need new types of navigation because at the moment the world relies very heavily on the global network of satellites to tell everybody where they are, said Professor Ed Hinds, director of the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial College London.Scientists teleport particle into space in major breakthroughIt\u0027s actually rather easy for that system to be emulated and in fact it\u0027s been estimated that the UK alone stands to lose about a billion pounds a day if the satellite navigation system were denied.GPS\u0026nbspemulation – or signal spoofing – can also put cargo ships at risk to piracy,\u0026nbspDr Malcolm said, with\u0026nbsppirates\u0026nbspknown to\u0026nbspspoof signals in order to lure high-value cargos to dangerous areas.This is just the start of the journey for quantum navigation, he said. Scientists like Heisenberg and Einstein described these quantum ideas in their theories, but it\u0027s taken until now to actually physically make them a reality.\u0026nbspThe step forward this kind of technology offers\u0026nbspis unbelievable. First there was analogue, then digital – the next great leap is quantum.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If you try to buy more than the limited number, your booking may be cancelled without notice, meaning no-one gets to go.5) Get your friends to try too, but stay in contact in case you all succeed and end up with a bunch of tickets you didn’t want. If you do need to sell any on, do so at face value. No-one likes a tout.6) Be patient and avoid refreshing or switching between browsers. Stick with one tab and have some faith!

The Queen and the massed ranks of the old British establishment will gather, as ever, for the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph, exactly a century after guns finally fell silent on the western front.This being a special anniversary, there’s also a special Songs of Praise\u0026nbspfrom\u0026nbspthe BBC (which in 1918 was still four years away from its birth, and so couldn’t cover the actual arrival of peace). This is followed by Home Front Heroes, in which celebrities, inevitably, reflect on the family’s wartime history. Then there’s another service at Westminster Abbey, plus a special documentary about that installation of ceramic poppies at the Tower of London in 2014.\u0026nbspBut the televisual guns do not fall silent, such is the abiding fascination with the “war to end all wars”. There’s 100 Year of the RAF, tail-end johnnies flying in on Friday night and Dan Cruickshank’s Monuments of Remembrance on Tuesday, which tells the story of the architecture of all those gracious cemeteries and memorials that have been such centres of attention again.\u0026nbspPeter Jackson’s astonishing WW1 documentary is like no otherProbably the best, and most original, of the many documentaries devoted to the First World War is They Shall Not Grow Old. This is more of a feature film in fact, created as it is by Peter Jackson (best known for directing the Lord of the Rings trilogy). You may have seen the advance publicity: original film has been cleaned up, colourised, converted to 3D and rendered with an almost contemporary look. Thus that faded, jumpy black-and-white conflict is transformed into something that might have been videoed last week (not that we have any shortage of wars nowadays anyway).Of course, something of the same has been done with The Second World War in Colour and similar series, but nothing as ambitious as this, nor so well put together with audio from old soldiers’ remembrances. Even those suffering from a touch of war weariness after four years of anniversary broadcasting will appreciate the depth of effort that has gone into this. Now all we have to do is get ready for the 1939-45 show.People Just Do Nothing was, and is, one of the funniest things to come out of Hounslow, or anywhere.\u0026nbspIt’s about a bunch of idiots in a UK garage (or something) crew who run a pirate radio station. The police raided them at the end of that last series but, as one of the mugs tells us in this (sadly) the final series, the audience was so pitifully small that he virtually let them off. By the way, a feature film is on the way, plus a tour or two.\u0026nbspBBC3 (BBC)In mockumetary style, PJDN is a superbly scripted and enacted chronicle of fecklessness, corruption (ironically or not), drug abuse, evil, delusion and, above all, astonishing stupidity. It’s hard to pick out one of them who are last among equals, so to speak, but I suppose it has to be the scene-stealing Chabbuddy G, aka the Mayor of Hounslow, aka the Brown Casanova, aka the Ultrapaneer, aka Alan Brown Sugar, aka Asim Chaudhry. By the way, Chabuds has a girthy book out, “How To Be a Man”, in such he celebrates his success, especially as a lover: “Hey, sugar face, wanna make some beige babies and live the Ukip nightmare?”Chabuds joins MC Grindah (Allan Mustafa), Mish (Lily Brazier) CJ Beats (Hugo Chegwin), and DJ Steves (Steve Stamp) also try to pit their minuscule wits against a hostile world. So bad are they at it that the BBC has even promoted them to BBC2, from their previous existence on BBC3, which transformed itself into a mighty digital comedy incubator when most\u0026nbspexpected it to curl up and die (This Country and Murder in Successville were other great achievements).\u0026nbspThis week Kurupt FM try to replace their pirate radio kit that the police confiscated. In a small homage to Only Fools and Horses,\u0026nbspChabuddy styles himself as Dahl Boy goes hustling. The genius of the British has always been improvisation...I can easily recommend The Little Drummer Girl, which maintains its high standards in this, the third episode. Obviously, rather like the real-life Mossad officers and Palestinian terrorists that feature at the heart of this drama, I can’t reveal too much about what you’re going to see, but you may rest assured it is gripping, beautifully shot and stylishly acted, with standout performances from Michael Shannon (Israeli spymaster Martin Kurtz) and Florence Pugh (a high-tensile alloy of petulance and steel as the reluctant spyterrorist).Though I suppose nothing will surpass the 1979 dramatisation of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, this Le Carre dramatisation is certainly a fine piece of craft, on a par with The Night Manager. Fine viewing, then: no secret about that.Carre\u0026nbspbook (BBC)The animal kingdom is full of endearing creatures that are more or less endangered. (In fact we homo sapiens are actually the most pathetic, seeing as we know we will die out because we’re killing our own planet, but can’t be bothered to do much about it. But I digress.)There can be few more charming things on four trotters than the tapir, and specifically the rare Malaysian tapir, which is basically a pig with a gigantic schnozzle. They look stupid, and they are, and the pair featured in The Secret Life of the Zoo don’t even seem too much keen on mating. No wonder they’re dying out.Last, there’s no shortage of sport out there if you want to desert the western front. International rugby kicks off on Saturday, with England playing the All Blacks maybe the highlight. Sky is also offering, live, the UnitedCity Manchester Derby on Sunday.

If it means we vote against the government, we vote against the government.“If it’s defeated, it means they’ve got a choice – either go back and negotiate something better or resign.”The tests covered “the benefits to every part of the UK”, including “the Northern Ireland border” and “the kind of regulatory framework in which we’ll live”.Mr Corbyn faced questions after telling the German newspaper Der Spiegel: “We can’t stop it. The referendum took place. Article 50 has been triggered. What we can do is recognise the reasons why people voted Leave.”He also expressed sympathy for the prime minister over the “impossible task” of reaching an agreement with Brussels and uniting the Tory party, adding: “I am a decent human being, I feel sorry for anyone in distress.”Preparations made for hospital food shortages if no-deal BrexitListen to what Jeremy Corbyn says: he doesn’t want to stop BrexitEU leaders say key Brexit issues still not resolvedJo Johnson resigns in latest act of Brexit as family psychodramaBut Mr Pennycook sought to reassure Labour supporters – who, polls show, overwhelmingly back another referendum – by saying the policy decided at September’s Liverpool conference was “clear”.He tweeted: “If parliament rejects May’s deal and we are unable to secure a general election, all options must be on the table and that includes campaigning for another referendum in which Remain cannot be ruled out as an option.”Underlining the backlash, Wes Streeting, a Labour backbencher, called on the party to make the “full-throated case” for a people’s vote.“Labour cannot sit by and allow the choice to be between the economic ruin of a hard Brexit or the loss of sovereignty under Theresa May’s deal, with Britain subjected to EU rules but with no say over them,” he said.Chris Leslie, another pro-EU MP, said: “With even Tory ministers recognising Brexit threatens the poorest in society, our public services and Britain’s place in the world, to have a Labour leader just shrug about it, then go awol, is nothing short of a dereliction of duty,” he said.And a third, Chuka Umunna, said: “We can stop this Tory Brexit but, ultimately, it should be for the people to decide.“A large majority of Labour members, supporters and voters not only want a people’s vote but to change our country in the EU. If the party sets its face against this, it will never be forgiven.”\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is simply no excuse – either for Labour as a whole, or for inidual Labour MPs – not to oppose this agenda and give the people a final say.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?\u0026nbspBen Chu\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followIndy PoliticsFrench lessons? France has a 35-hour working week, implemented in 2000Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, has been making encouraging noises about the idea of a four-day working week for some months now.\u0026nbspAnd this week things seemed to move on a bit further for the opposition party as it was reported that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has spoken to the cross-bench peer Lord Skidelsky about the possibility of an inquiry into the topic.\u0026nbspBut what’s the argument for such a reform? How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?Why would we want to move to a four-day week?Many advocates cite greater work-life balance. Working one fewer day a week would free workers up to look after children, elderly parents or simply to have more leisure time.But Mr McDonnell has talked about the move in terms of productivity – or a worker’s output per hour.He argues that British workers work the longest hours in Europe and yet are among the least productive.Give workers four-day week and more pay, unions sayThe four-day week could transform our lives and our economy Schools consider four-day week in cost cutting driveThat’s\u0026nbspborne out by the data we have.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u0026nbspestimates that UK workers put in an average of 1,681 hours a year in 2017. That compared\u0026nbspwith 1,514 in France and 1,356 in Germany.\u0026nbspYet the Office for National Statistics calculates that GDP per worker in the UK is lower than both those countries.Labour’s lesson seems to be that one way to boosting our weak national productivity is actually to give people less time in the workplace to encourage them to work more efficiently while they are there.\u0026nbspWhile this might sound fanciful it’s not totally outlandish. One recent study from New Zealand showed that when workers moved to a four-day week at one firm their per-hour productivity did indeed rise.The argument is that a better work-life balance makes people more motivated, perhaps by reducing productivity-sapping illness and stress.How could it be implemented?This is a key question. For whatever the theoretical merits of a four-day week for productivity, ordering the entire economy to shift immediately to such a radically different working time structure would clearly be massively disruptive.Angela Merkel’s economic success may be more about luck than strategyEmployers would have to reconfigure shift patterns dramatically, in some cases having to hire many more workers. Think in particular of public services like schools and the health services. Think of the retail and transport sectors.\u0026nbspAlso, around 15 per cent of the UK workforce is now self-employed. It’s hard to see how the state could practically compel those 5\u0026nbspmillion self-employed workers to limit their working week to four days.One policy possibility\u0026nbspa Labour inquiry might consider is whether\u0026nbspto offer tax breaks or other kinds of support to firms that offer four-day working to employees, hoping that this could\u0026nbspencourage the practice to spread.What would be the impact on the economy?That would depend to a large degree on those productivity effects.\u0026nbspThe size of the economy is the value of the output of goods and services produced over a certain period. Working fewer hours would, as a first order effect, seem likely to reduce the volume of those goods and services, thus contracting the economy.\u0026nbspBut if we could produce more of that output in a given period that negative impact would be mitigated, perhaps even wiped out altogether.And\u0026nbspeconomies are dynamic too.\u0026nbspIf we could increase our productivity\u0026nbspgrowth rate\u0026nbspthrough a shorter working week the economy could, theoretically, be larger over the long run.\u0026nbspCritics argue that the productivity impacts are unproven, and that France, with its 35-hour week, has higher unemployment and a more rigid labour market than the UK, something that seems to be particularly unfair on young people.Yet it’s also worth noting that in the late 1900s UK workers put in on average more than 2500 hours a year, almost 50 per cent more than today. But our economy is far larger than it was then due to productivity growth.\u0026nbspThe big-picture historical lesson is that it’s certainly not impossible for average living standards to rise even as average hours worked falls.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But foreign female fans have been allowed to attend some games.Daughters of the revolution: The Iranian women fighting the hijabThe women joined in with chanting in support of Persepolis, Iran’s best-supported club.In March, 35 women were detained for trying to attend a match between Persepolis and another Tehran team.However, in June women were allowed to watch their national team play in the World Cup against Spain.And last month about 100 women were allowed to watch a friendly between Iran and Bolivia, but restrictions were quickly reinstated.Created with Sketch.Iran protests – in pictures Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.University students at an anti-government protest inside Tehran University, 30 December 2017A university student at a protest inside Tehran University while a smoke grenade is thrown by anti-riot Iranian police, 30 December 2017University students at a protest inside Tehran University, 30 December 2017University students run away from the police during an anti-government protest inside Tehran University, 30 December 2017An image grab taken from a handout video released by Iran\u0027s Mehr News agency reportedly shows a group of men pulling at a fence in a street in Tehran, 30 December 2017Demonstrators gather to protest in Tehran, 30 December 2017Iranians chant slogans as they march in support of the government near the Imam Khomeini grand mosque in Tehran, 30 December 2017Iranians chant slogans as they march in support of the government near the Imam Khomeini grand mosque in Tehran, December 30 2017 Iranian clerics take part during a state-organized rally against anti-government protests in the country, in the holy city of Qom, south west Iran, 3 January 2018In this photo provided by the Iranian Students\u0027 News Agency, a clergyman takes a picture of a pro-government demonstration in the southwestern city of Ahvaz, Iran, 3 January 2018Pro-government demonstrators gather at the Massoumeh shrine in Iran\u0027s holy city of Qom, some 130 kilometres south of Tehran, 3 January 2018University students at an anti-government protest inside Tehran University, 30 December 2017A university student at a protest inside Tehran University while a smoke grenade is thrown by anti-riot Iranian police, 30 December 2017University students at a protest inside Tehran University, 30 December 2017University students run away from the police during an anti-government protest inside Tehran University, 30 December 2017An image grab taken from a handout video released by Iran\u0027s Mehr News agency reportedly shows a group of men pulling at a fence in a street in Tehran, 30 December 2017Demonstrators gather to protest in Tehran, 30 December 2017Iranians chant slogans as they march in support of the government near the Imam Khomeini grand mosque in Tehran, 30 December 2017Iranians chant slogans as they march in support of the government near the Imam Khomeini grand mosque in Tehran, December 30 2017 Iranian clerics take part during a state-organized rally against anti-government protests in the country, in the holy city of Qom, south west Iran, 3 January 2018In this photo provided by the Iranian Students\u0027 News Agency, a clergyman takes a picture of a pro-government demonstration in the southwestern city of Ahvaz, Iran, 3 January 2018Pro-government demonstrators gather at the Massoumeh shrine in Iran\u0027s holy city of Qom, some 130 kilometres south of Tehran, 3 January 2018Open Stadiums, a group that campaigns for access to venues for women in Iran, handed a petition to Fifa this week signed by more than 200,000 people.Ending the exclusion “has been our dream for decades”, a spokeswoman\u0026nbspfor the group told the agency. “We are also excluded from public happiness and excitement.”Kashima beat Persepolis 2-0 on aggregate.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

It uses the Snapdragon 845 processor and runs on a customised version of Google\u0027s Android operating system.All are features found on rival high-end phones that can cost more than £700, but Xiaomi is to sell the Mi 8 Pro starting at £499, as part of a strategy it calls honest pricing.Xiaomi opens Mi Stores in UK and USWang Xiang, the firm\u0027s senior vice president, said: Today we witness a new chapter in Xiaomi\u0027s global expansion journey, underpinned by our global ambitions.We are thrilled to make great strides by announcing our arrival in the UK.By bringing a range of our amazing products at honest pricing we want to offer more choices and let everyone in the UK enjoy a connected simple life through our innovative technology.The company will face stiff competition to establish itself in a crowded market, with three new iPhones, two Google Pixel 3 handsets and devices from Samsung, Sony and fellow Chinese firms Huawei and OnePlus being released in recent months.As well as the Pro, Xiaomi will also launch its budget Redmi 6A device for £99, which it claims has a battery that can last for up to 19 days.The Chinese firm is also bringing a range of its other gadgets to the UK, including its Band 3 wearable fitness tracker and an electric scooter.These products will go on sale in a physical Xiaomi Mi store, which will open at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd\u0027s Bush, London, on November 18.Mobiles expert Ru Bhikha said the firm\u0027s arrival in the UK should be taken seriously.Since releasing its first smartphone in August 2011, Xiaomi has rapidly gained a strong foothold in the market - so much so that it\u0027s already the fourth largest handset manufacturer in the world, he said.Xiaomi\u0027s highly anticipated arrival in the UK therefore threatens to put a big cat amongst the pigeons - by combining top tier design and performance with relatively modest pricing, it poses a real threat to the market.Looking at Xiaomi\u0027s success so far, it\u0027s hard to see how its winning combination of high-end smartphones with lower-than-expected prices won\u0027t drive similar results over here.Thursday\u0027s launch marks the arrival of a significant new kid on the block, and there is no doubt that in finally coming to the UK, Xiaomi means business.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Should parents be worried  Absolutely, say the experts.The National Crime Agency estimates that about , people in the UK pose a threat of some kind to children online — and the number is rising all the time.It adds there has been a  per cent increase in the referrals it has received about people uploading images of child sexual abuse since .Just as alarming is the damaging effect that smartphones and social media have on children’s mental health.According to Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University, the number of US teens who took their own lives increased by  per cent between  and .And , like me, you have a teenage daughter there is even more reason to be worried.Compared to the early s, nearly twice as many American teenage girls now end their own lives. In the UK, a quarter of -year-old girls experienced signs of depression, according to a study of , young people.Overall, Professor Twenge found that the generation she calls “iGen” — those born after  — are much more likely  to suffer from mental health issues than their millennial predecessors.“What happened that so many more teens, in such a short period of time, would feel depressed, attempt ­suicide and commit suicide ” she asks. “The sudden rise of the smartphone.”If you’re not convinced by the advice of the experts, just look at the behaviour of the people who’ve made their fortunes from peddling this digital crack cocaine.Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft, stopped his children from owning a phone until they were  and the late Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, would not let his kids play on iPads — even though he invented them.Apple recently introduced a new update that tells you how much time you are spending on your screen each day.That’s a step in the right direction, but don’t expect the company to do too much more. Last year, Apple sold nearly a quarter of a billion iPhones, helping to make it the world’s most valuable brand.The leaders of the tech giants are enriching themselves beyond their ­wildest dreams — not just at our expense but at the expense of our children.So it’s pretty clear they won’t be doing anything to help.

We thought we’d have three. But we just love having a big family.“There’s never a dull moment. It’s a happy house full of laughter and we just love being surrounded by all our children.

On October , King George V gave his consent.In the days before the Armistice, four teams of an officer and two other ranks set off in secrecy to the battlefields of Somme, Aisne, Arras and Ypres.We are now offering it free as a resource for teachers.

Subject to availability.They dug up the remains of four British soldiers killed early in the war, so they would be unidentiable.Each body, carried in sacking, was examined at the Military Headquarters at St Pol, south of Calais, before being covered with a Union Flag.At just after midnight on November , Brigadier General John Wyatt, head of British Forces in France, chose one body.The Unknown Warrior would receive the respect and honours given only to princes, generals and the greatest of statesmen.The following day in Boulogne, where crowds lined the streets, his body was transferred from a pine box to a coffin hewn from a -year-old oak that once stood at Hampton Court.Under leaden skies, the Unknown Warrior passed the White Clfs of Dover aboard HMS Verdun, which sailed in silence into the dock.It was the same journey that over the four years of the war more than a million Tommies wounded in the hell of the Western Front had taken.As the train carrying his body and a barrel of soil from a French battlefield thundered through Kent, crowds gathered at every station.At London’s Victoria station he lay in state overnight, before being carried on a gun carriage to Whitehall just before am — his coffin covered in a blood-stained battlefield Union Flag.In a ceremony unchanged for  years, the Monarch and princes, surrounded by generals and politicians, waited at theCenotaph for Big Ben to strike  o’clock on Thursday, November , .In nearby Westminster Abbey, a thousand widows and mothers — all believing the Unknown Warrior was their husband or son — waited.A Times reporter inside the Abbey, wrote: “The tension was almost too great. When seconds seemed to halt people held their breath lest they be heard in the stillness. At last a woman sobbed and the breakdown helped release the tears which others had with dficulty held trembling on their eyelids. Many were weeping at the end of the two minutes.” The King — just like our Queen did for more than half a century and now Prince Charles — placed the first wreath at the Cenotaph on behalf of a grateful nation. After a short service at the Cenotaph, the Unknown Warrior’s coffin was carried into the Abbey.A tin helmet, a side-arm and the King’s wreath lay on top.The King, with his generals and admirals of the fleet, stood at the grave as the coffin was lowered and covered in the earth from the Western Front.Outside, hundreds of thousands of people waited to file past the Cenotaph. Such were the numbers that it took them up to six hours to walk the three-quarters of a mile from Trafalgar Square to Westminster Abbey.The outpouring of grief saw The Cenotaph almost buried in wreaths of mainly green and white flowers — Poppies were not introduced until the following year.In the four days that followed in , one and a quarter million grieving families filed past the Cenotaph, placing an astonishing , wreaths on the new memorial to the Glorious Dead.They carried on down Whitehall, which had been closed to traffic, to pay their respects at the grave of the Unknown Warrior.They called it the People’s Pilgrimage and the only other outpouring of grief to come near was the death of Princess Diana eight decades later.A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which is responsible for arranging tomorrow’s ceremony, said: “When we saw the pictures of the first Armistice in  we wanted to create a People’s Pilgrimage for today.”So the People’s Procession was born, where descendants of the men and women who served in the Great War could remember them.The Royal British Legion held a ballot and ten thousand people won their place in the mile-long walk that starts on the Mall at .pm.They will follow the , military veterans of all conflicts who will march past the Cenotaph from .am.

But it will be flawed –– and Mrs May should say so.I admit this sounds odd: Why would a Prime Minister admit that a deal they have negotiated isn’t great ButMrs May tries to say that this agreement is perfect, and that there is no risk of any part of the UK getting stuck in the backstop — which would leave it in an EU customs union but with no say over the trade deals the EU is doing — then she will easily be disproved.Mrs May should take a leaf out of the book of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who as a hugely successful trial lawyer knows a fair bit about persuading people of his case.He told Cabinet on Tuesday that when it came to quitting the backstop “a unilateral right would give the UK greater scope to establish its case, as the other side would have to prove the contrary”.But he went on to acknowledge that negotiating a unilateral right to get out of the backstop was highly unlikely in the time available and a mutual review mechanism could be made to work.Cox’s essential argument is about managing risk. Every option on Brexit now carries with it risk.The challenge is to work out how to best manage these risks. The risk with accepting a legally binding backstop in the withdrawal agreement is that the UK ends up being unable to get out of it cleanly.It would be direthe UK ended up leaving the EU in a way that tied it to the EU for ever.But set against this must be the risk of no deal, and the disruption that would cause. To make matters worse, the Government has done absurdly little to mitigate no deal.The reason that even Cabinet ministers who loathe where the negotiations are heading do not want to go for no deal is they know how unprepared the country is for it.At the same time, there is a risk thatthere is no deal, Parliament would either insist on a second referendum — that would harden isions and toxy our politics — or cancel the process altogether, creating a dangerous democratic deficit.Frankly, the argument that Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement is less bad than the alternatives will be pretty much the only thing going for it.It will be hard for her to make this argument as so many of the deal’s problems are self-inflicted.She triggered Article  without knowing what the UK wanted she has wasted much of the past  months in a negotiation with her own Cabinet the failure to plan properly for no deal has weakened the Government’s negotiating position.Even the Parliamentary arithmetic has been made worse by Mrs May. If she hadn’t called that election, there would be a Tory majority and she wouldn’t be so reliant on the DUP.But it is the argument that her deal is less bad than the alternatives that is keeping the Cabinet on board and it is her best — and, possibly, only — way of getting the House of Commons to vote for such a flawed agreement.THE bad news for Theresa May is that it doesn’t get any easier once she’s got a deal with Brussels.For she will still have to get this withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons.With the DUP unhappy and  Tory Brexit ultras expected to vote against the deal, as well as Jo Johnson and other Tories who want another referendum, it will be extremely tough to get it over the line.“I can’t quite see where the majority comes from,” admits one Cabinet minister.But there is growing talk that the way to get the deal through might be to bring it back a second time, with the markets – which expect a deal – freaking out.As this Secretary of State says: “Do you get it through the first time  Maybe not.He did little to hide his irritation at being moved from his job as universities minister because of his opposition to Mrs May’s plan to tinker with tuition fees.But his resignation is a blow to the PM – and not just because of his attack on her for “a failure of British statecraft not seen since the Suez crisis”.His departure will put more pressure on those ministerial colleagues who privately share his view that a second referendum is needed, to go.With both Johnsons voting against the withdrawal agreement, it will become even harder to get it through the Commons.SO will any of the Cabinet resign over Theresa May’s Brexit plan  At the moment, ministers believe not.One of those who spoke against the May approach at Cabinet tells me the mood of the meeting was “resigned rather than resigning”.Another predicts critics of what Mrs May is doing “will make their point, then retreat”.This is not to say people are happy. Penny Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary, warned that voters wanted a “definitive end point to Brexit” andthey didn’t get it, that risked “feeding a narrative of betrayal, fuelling Ukip”.In private, ministers rail against Mrs May and the way she is handling the negotiations. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been heard to complain that the UK is making it far too obvious it is in a desperate hurry to get a deal.It is certainly true that by advertising its need for a quick agreement, the UK is almost inviting the EU to ask for more.Tellingly, there is renewed – and increasing – talk among ministers of having a new leader in place to do the next set of negotiations.There is little love for the backstop. And interestingly, Chancellor Philip Hammond argued in Cabinet this week it would be better to extend the transition than trigger the backstop.He argued that the backstop could do damage to supply chains and said “it could be better to extend the implementation period than have a bad backstop”.A problem with extending the implementation period is that it would mean free movement would continue – and the UK would still be sending huge amounts of money to Brussels every year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When the Russians and French threatened to get involved, the conflict escalated quickly.Britain ordered ­Germany not to enter Belgium as its ­soldiers marched on France and after an “unsatisfactory reply,” declared war on August .But by the end of the summer the German army had got within  miles of Paris.In December an informal   truce   allow- ed troops to enjoy a Christmas football game in no man’s land — but the war was far from over.The main theatre of war took place on what was known as the Western Front.Some of the most brutal battles were fought there amid  miles of barbed wire-covered tren-ches which were regularly battered by artillery bombardments.Machine gun placements cut down brave soldiers whenever they raised their heads.The Battle of ­Gallipoli began in February as combined British, French, Indian, New Zealand, Australian and ­Canadian forces fought German ally the Turkish Ottoman Empire.The early Allied attack, led by future Premier Winston Churchill, ended in humiliating defeat.The Battle of Jutland was the ­biggest naval conflict of the war and ­pitted the British fleet against the Germans and their “Dreadnought” battleships. Around  ships and , troops were involved in the epic North Sea ­confrontation that began in May.Both sides suffered heavy losses with the Royal Navy losing  ships and more than , men to the Germans’  ships and , men.July saw the start of the Battle of the Somme, a massive joint-British and French operation to drive the Germans out of northern France.However, an advance of , men to capture the enemy trenches failed, despite a seven-day bombardment beforehand.On the first day , men were killed, making it the bloodiest day in British military ­history. Over the next  days no more than three square miles of enemy territory were taken.The Third Battle of Ypres, named after a Belgian town, became notorious for the rain and mud that clogged rles, halted tanks and led to men and horses drowning.Also known as the Battle of ­Passchendaele after a village that was captured by our troops, this battle saw , British ­casualties and , German.By spring, many ­Germans felt sure of victory as their forces crossed the Western Front towards Paris.But the advance cost , casualties and their th Army ran out of supplies.At the same time hundreds of thousands of American soldiers poured into France after the US declared war on Germany. Between March and July, the Germans suffered a million casualties and the tide had turned.The Hundred Days Offensive began in August and the Germans began surrendering in large numbers. By November the war was over.The first Armistice Day was held by King George V in the grounds of Buckingham Palace on November , . The same year, a two-minute silence was proposed to remember the millions who died.Today, a two-minute Remembrance Sunday silence to commemorate both world wars is held at am at the Cenotaph in London.THE World War One Centenary Roll of Honour supplement in today’s Sun on Sunday carries the names of readers’ relatives who served in the Great War.Here, Joshua Salisbury reveals some of the heartbreaking and inspiring stories of those who bravely fought in the conflict.Mel Hewards grandfather Ralph Ellis ­suffered more than most ­during the war, ­losing four of his seven brothers — three of them within just three months of each other in . Their bodies have never been ed home.Mel’s great uncle, Pte Walter Ellis was killed in Iraq on June ,  Pte ­Richard Henry Ellis died of wounds received in France on July  Pte Ben Ellis was killed in action at High Wood, France, on September  and Cpl ­Percival Ellis died from wounds received in Flanders on April , .Every Armistice Day, Mel meets with her extended family in a pub near Exeter to remember their lost ­relatives.She said: “These days Ralph would have been diagnosed with PTSD or at least taken back from the ­front line on hearing of his ­brothers’ deaths. But times were dferent back then.”Armistice comes with mixed ­feelings for Pamela Fairley, , of Smallfield, Surrey, as her great-uncle Thomas Highgate was the first soldier to be shot at dawn, on September , , for desertion.“He must have been so scared,” says grandmother-of-two Pamela. “He was young and came from a really impoverished background.”After the war, -year-old Thomas’s name was omitted from memorials despite his service in the deadly Battle of Mons, Belgium. He was ­pardoned, alongside  other ­soldiers, in .Pamela says: “Thomas might have been shot at dawn but he will never be ­forgotten.”They are worth protecting. Every British serviceman has fought in the name of those principles.Sergeant Jack Cottrell helped keep his fellow soldiers’ spirits up with his musical talent, says his son Peter.“He never spoke much about his time serving but I know he’d travel round the country entertaining the troops, to keep morale high.”Jack’s talent later meant he penned some of George Formby’s greatest hits including Baby, Why Don’t Women Like Me , ­Sitting On The Ice At The Ice Rink and I Could Make A Good Living At That.Peter says: “Dad was only in his ­fties when he passed away and while his musical ­talent has skipped every generation since then, I’m incredibly proud of his efforts during the war.”Private Norman Harvey was just  when he lied about his age in order to join the Royal Inniskilling ­Fusiliers in . He went on to be one of the youngest ­recipients of the Victoria Cross in the war.He died fighting near ­Palestine in  after enlisting for the ­Second World War.His great-nephew John Savage, who recently met up with more than  relatives to celebrate Norman’s achievement, recalls: “Mum always talked about him with pride.“I remember her telling me that when he came home with his Victoria Cross, he was put straight on a cart and wheeled around the town for ­everyone to see and hear.”Norman’s VC citation details his bravery while fighting at Ingoyghen, Belgium, in October , after ­he rushed forward single-handedly to take on  enemy soldiers.He is remembered with a statue and a street, Norman Harvey VC Close, in his home town of Newton Le Willows, Lancs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I just thought they were wonderful.”Hamish, from Edinburgh, joined the Black Watch shortly after his th birthday when war broke out in , despite having a heart condition.All siblings Robert and Rosemary had to remember him by was a photo in their gran’s house — and the family always seemed reluctant to speak about their fallen relative, as many were after the war.Robert, , said: “When Rosie and I were kids we used to stay with granny, Isabel Mann, in Edinburgh and we’d say, ‘Well, who is this person ’She was obviously very upset about it even then, which would be  or .“But nothing was ever forthcoming. It was simply he died in the war.”It wasn’t until years later, when the siblings were clearing out their mum’s house in Peeblesshire, Scotland, following her move to a nursing home, they came across Hamish’s trunk.Rosemary, , said: “We found few bits and pieces that were of great interest, the main one being the trunk with Hamish’s things it.”With the house sale imminent, the pair were under pressure to clear the property — and were close to selling all the contents of the loft for just £, despite one box they found being left unopened.Dad-of-two Robert said: “On the last day I said, ‘yikes, we still haven’t dealt with that box’. So that was the moment critique.”Rosemary, a music teacher in Edinburgh, opened the box to discover notebooks and letters belonging to their great-uncle Hamish Mann.She took everything home and tried to make some sense of all the papers.She said: “All the papers were mixed up so you might begin reading a poem and find it finished halfway.And the next piece of paper you came across was part of a funny play he’d written at school. I laid all out on the floor and for several months didn’t do much .”They turned to friend and writer Jacquie, who started researching Hamish’s background.She discovered he’d been ill as a child suffering from an enlarged heart, also known as cardio myopathy.The author said: “He was bedridden for a good year during which time he wrote about a hundred poems or so.He made good use of his bedridden time but it was very hard for him.”Jacquie found out he’d worked for a repertory company as a teenager and performed on the Lyceum Stage in Edinburgh, where he also wrote a number of plays.And an old copy of Stage Magazine revealed he’d been named one of their playwrights of the year aged just .A year after he received the theatrical honour, war broke out.An extract from Hamish Mann’s writings in A Muddy Trench: A Sniper’s BulletThat newly captured trench I shall never forget, nor the anguish I felt as we filed slowly in, through the clinging mud in the misty light of the moon. It was the most repellent sight I have ever seen, and the absolute horror of it was not in any way lessened by the splendid atmosphere of noble sacrice that reigned everywhere.It was almost impossible in many cases to distinguish between the dead and the living, so motionless did the latter lie in their exhaustion, after the terrible work of taking the trench. Some of the bodies were dreadful, seated on the floor of the trench in natural positions, their faces fallen back, upturned, ghostly-white, cheeks sunken, teeth gleaming through the grin of death that had parted their pale lips.Others were face-downwards, clots of blood on their unorms, gashed and bedraggled, half sunk in the mud — just as they had fallen in that last supreme moment. A few were terribly mangled.One had had his body from the waist upwards blown completely away, and the poor, pitul legs were lying against the sloping parados of that unspeakable trench.Wounded were littered everywhere, and it rent one’s heart to hear them moan and rave in the delirium of their suffering, or cry aloud as someone stumbled against them in the dark. It was impossible not to do this, for many of these wretched men were almost smothered in the sucking slimeStill we filed along, all but sickened by the nauseating stench of decomposing human bodies, a distinctive smell which is even now in my nostrils.Hamish — real name Alexander James — was  but his health condition meant he didn’t have to sign-up.Instead, he lied on forms about his fitness, sought a second opinion from medics and went to war.Rosemary said: “He always said he wasn’t so interested in being a soldier, but he was a patriot and always wanted to do his best for his country, so had this huge sense of duty.He had one consultant who failed him and said his heart wasn’t up to it. However, he tried again.“I think the doctor on that day didn’t have the time to go into things in too much depth and he said, ‘this time I got by’.After signing up, he was sent to Northern France in , arriving first in the Somme before being stationed throughout the region, including billets at Gouy-Servins and Mingoval.He wrote his last poem on the morning of April , after musing about his fallen friends and wonderinghe’d be next.Three days later his battalion marched to Arras, their objective was to capture the enemy’s front line.But Hamish was hit full force by a German shell and he died on the battlefield.The book has brought together Hamish’s story along with his poetry penned from the heart of the conflict and his other works.Jacquie added: “You feel you are there with him. And that is not always a good thing.But you do and it makes such a dference. And he was so young.”Hamish’s family are so proud to have been abe to piece together his work and bring it to a new audience.Rosemary said: “We all felt that it was our duty to honour him by doing something about all this writing.We’re so pleased and relieved people are showing an interest in the book.”Robert, now based in Eastbourne, East Sussex, and a retired purchasing manager, said: added: “He is one of millions of soldiers who died in that war and as a very young person I suppose I just always thought, well this is just another one.“I say that not flippantly but how do you draw attention to one of millions of people who died in the war “However, he just had something  for the world to know.”Muddy Trench: A Sniper’s Bullet: Hamish Mann, Black Watch, Officer-Poet, -, by Jacquie Buttriss is out on hardback on November  priced £"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000447769554.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"stop praying silence from charles","story":"But close your eyes and imagine, for a moment, knowing from childhood exactly what job you are going to do — because you have no choice about whether or not you actually want to do it.And imagine, then, having to wait for that job to start until you are the age when most people are hanging up their work boots and starting to claim a pension.It’s impossible, right  But the Prince of Wales — the man who was born to be king — has known since the age of four that he would one day have to step into his mother’s shoes. And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them. But, given that Kirk Douglas is , maybe it’s just a reminder that things come full circle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sources say three ministers are in “advanced talks” to follow his lead and plunge Theresa May’s government into fresh turmoil. One insider said: “They are shyplanning when exactly is the right time to do it. Jo set the news agenda by releasing his decision on Friday evening. Everyone was a bit surprised. “The logical thing to do would have been to quit after the Brexit Cabinet meeting. So it’s important they get this right.” Mr Johnson, who backed Remain during the  campaign, quit his role as Transport Minister.  In his resignation statement, he said he believed the public should have a second referendum. And he blasted the PM’s handling of Brexit negotiations. Mr Johnson is the sixth minister to quit over Brexit since Mrs May’s January reshuffle. Three were Leavers, including Boris. The others were Remainers. Mr Johnson’s decision piles more pressure on Mrs May, who faces a crunch week in Parliament. Tory MP Anna Soubry, also a Remain campaigner, said: “Jo isn’t the only minister who shares these views and I hope others will follow his lead.” One insider said: “We know there are three ministers in talks but it will be interesting to see what the Cabinet does.  “Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey will be thinking about it.

Cheap imitations of expensive designer outfits worn on red carpets or catwalks by actresses, models and other stars now find their way online within days of making public debuts. However they are not made in sweltering sweatshops in Asia but the back streets of Leicester. Fans are desperate to look like celebs such as Kim Kardashian, Michelle Keegan and Paris Hilton but cannot afford the same price tag. Speed is essential as some pop-up internet shops won’t wait a month for stock to come from the Far East. So there is a roaring trade in churning out instant copies which sell for as little as pound – while many workers do not get paid anything like the pound. minimum wage. The Sunday Mirror investigated as MPs were told wage abuses were an open secret in Leicester’s garment industry, a huge part of which was “a country within a country” flouting labour law.  One illegal worker called Sunny told us he had worked under the noses of auditors supposed to enforce “ethical” working conditions and even fled out of back doors to dodge immigration officials, Sunny, , originally from Gudjerat, India, arrived in Leicester in . He said: “I was trained as a machinist for pound. an hour. I still work for pound shysometimes. I have worked in  to  dferent factories. I work  hours, six days a week, sometimes Sundays too. “The most I have earned is pound. but it is normally pound. to pound.. “There are lots of people like me. I’d say that in every factory of  people you would have three or four illegals.”  Leicester has  textile factories which can make a million clothes a week for booming online retailers. Most do comply with the law – but a number of small places ignore the rules. Bosses blame retailers who demand rapid deliveries, impose huge fines for being late and haggle over mere pennies. They also say retailers do not pay them for up to  days and charge for sending back unsold stock. Factory owner Saeed Khilji, chairman of the Textile Manufacturer Association of Leicestershire, employs workers legally but says demand for celeb outfits often drives production. He said: “If an outfit goes viral, retailers race to get their copy online.  “Ten years ago manufacturers could make pound profit from a dress but these days they would be lucky to make p. “None of the retailers are giving us an ethical price. An extra pound or pound. on a garment would sort everything out. Instead they squeeze us for pennies.” He added: “If they don’t sell everything, they send it back and charge us for the carriage. If we are an hour or  minutes late with delivery they fine us pound. I have been told of one retailer who is making poundmillion a year from fines.” Firms have complained that the new “Fast Forward” factory inspections, to which a number of major labels are signed up, is onerous. One said: “They want us to give contracts to our workers but they won’t give us contracts. When they are not busy, the factories can’t survive.”  Alkesh Kapadia, of Barcode Fashion, employs  workers in two factories and pays them the minimum wage. He said: “Retailers threaten, ‘If you can’t do it we will find someone ’. I say, ‘How does that work ’ If I can’t do it, how can anyone  ’” Another manufacturer said: “I used to make pound. to pound profit per garment. Now it might be p.” Two weeks ago the Commons shyEnvironmental Audit Committee heard evidence about sustainability in the fashion industry. Investigative journalist Sarah O’Connor told MPs: “If you go around the high street you will be amazed to see how many dresses say “Made in the UK” but cost pound, pound, pound.  “I wondered, ‘How on earth is this possible ’ The answer is that basically, in a huge chunk of Leicester’s garment industry, labour law does not apply.” Some retailers have joined the Ethical Trading Initiative where shyfactories undergo stricter audits, but others have not. Sarah O’Connor said: “One of the biggest would be Boohoo. They source an awful lot in Leicester. “They are not members of the ETI.” Sarah Ditty, of Fashion Revolution, told MPs: “There are a lot of brands that are not really disclosing any shyinformation about what they are doing.” MPs have called on five leading online-only fashion retailers – Boohoo, Amazon, Asos, PrettyLittleThing and Missguided – to give evidence as part of their inquiry into the industry. Boohoo told the Sunday Mirror it insists on suppliers “acknowledging responsibility” for paying a living wage and conducts third-party audits. It also denied fining for late shydeliveries or ing unsold items and said it pays suppliers within  days. Missguided said: “We’re proud of what we’ve been doing through our membership of the ETI to address industry issues.” ASOS declined to comment but there is no suggestion it does not adhere to industry rules."},{"url":null,"title":"couple eat mcdonalds every day","story":"NewsCouple eat McDonalds every day for  years - and rubbish claims its fatteningTom and Pauline Jones, both in their s, visit their local McDonalds in Bath every day - and for a heartwarming reasonShareCommentsByLiam Trim:,  NOV NewsTom and Pauline Jones have visited McDonalds in Bath almost every day for  years in a row \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA couple in their s have eaten at McDonalds every day for  years and say the idea the takeaway makes people fat is rubbish.

Renata Poncova died alongside her boyfriend, Tony Taylor, both , at Marchwood Close, Peckham, on November . Officers cordoned off the area after the incident at about .pm and both were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. Police believe the couple died in suspicious circumstances and have appealed to the public for more information. Neighbours said Ms Poncova, an Eastern European, recently lost her job at an apartment agency before her and Mr Taylor died last Friday. A shrine of flowers, pictures of Ms Poncova and candles are now outside the tower block, including a tribute from colleagues at The Apartment Service where she worked.  Witnesses of the aftermath described a “ghastly” scene after the pair landed on the pavement just inches apart in Southwark, south east London. The pair are believed to have been together for six months. Within hours of the fall, police forced their way into the flat, where they discovered evidence of a “possible disturbance”. Ms Poncova and Mr Taylor were said to have been in a short relationship and one neighbour said he had recently moved into her flat. She and Mr Taylor fell from the back of the nine-storey tower block, where her flat has several windows which open outwards.  A tribute left at the scene by colleagues said: “You will always be remembered in our hearts and thoughts, with love from your colleagues and friends at The Apartment Service.” Another said: “These sad times will never eclipse good times we had. Will miss you sister.” Police said next of kin have been informed and an investigation is underway as they appeal for information about the deaths. A neighbour, who lives on the same floor, said she saw Ms Poncova and Mr Taylor at about pm on the day she fell. The woman, who asked not to be named, said: “They were at the lt together, they were coming up but I was going down.  “I just saw her walking the dog, we would meet at the lt, but I haven’t seen the dog for a long time. “She seems nice.

Disadvantaged Year Six pupils were lagging up to NINE terms behind their peers nationally in certain subjects. Ofsted had graded the school “Inadequate”, slamming weak leadership and low expectations. But in less than four years Sam has reversed its fortunes with a series of clever innovations. One is a forest garden where disruptive kids go to calm down and light cooking fires, plant shyvegetables, look after chickens and play old-fashioned conkers.  Another is a rewards scheme offering treats dreamed up by the children, including football afternoons, chocolate parties and the chance to be “head for the day”, wearing one of Sam’s ties. Emphasis is put on politeness and visitors are ushered through the school by pupils opening doors. In Sam’s first  months, Ofsted upped its grading two places to “Good” and issues including truancy were tackled. In , just a third of the kids were achieving good results in reading, writing and maths. Now seven in ten are hitting their targets. Sam’s approach has changed le for some of the area’s most needy children, including a -year-old so troubled he was on the verge of being expelled from another school and a Year  child who could not cope with more than  minutes a time in the classroom. They are both now full-time at Benjies, as the school is affectionately known. Others in the deprived, low-income district have been helped by the school taking on a family support worker, providing free unorms and running breakfast and young carers clubs. Sam’s efforts were recognised by an acclaimed Pearson national award, School of the Year: Making a Dference, which gets lovingly polished every day.  Sam, now , who had previously taught in Nottingham and worked with under-privileged children in Lincoln, said: “I can’t take all the credit because it’s been a real team effort. “We recognise academic progress is important but we realise lots of building blocks need to be put in place. Many of those involve interventions that help pupils develop socially as well as academically.” He went on: “When I first joined the school I was a little nervous. There were staff members who had been here for years, which was a bit daunting. “I could see the drive and commitment staff had so I kept the same team. I wanted the school and the staff to get the reputation they deserved.” Benjies’ pupils live in one of Britain’s , worst-off districts – Gainsborough South-West Ward – which has high unemployment and crime.  Seven in ten kids are entitled to free school meals and  per cent have special educational needs, compared to a national average of  per cent. But one of the pupils, ten-year-old Keegan, said: “I like this school because they do very good education and Mr Coy always make the teachers do very hard work for the children.” Sam is now working on creating a community hub at the school where families can access debt counselling, housing support and a food bank. He added: “We want the school to be at the heart of the area. All the staff here are incredible and want to do their very best for the pupils – and that is everything.” "},{"url":null,"title":"health food supplements combat arthritis","story":"NewsHealth food supplements to combat arthritis and colds exposed as expensive fakesTrading Standards launched an investigation after complaints that some pills were less effective than othersShareCommentsByStephen Hayward:,  NOV NewsThe pills have been branded useless supplements \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHealth food supplements to combat arthritis and colds have been exposed as expensive fakes.

So imagine how tough it can be when youre serving  roast dinners in each of your restaurants every week and not just the extended family. Thats the task faced every week by the expert chefs of The Toby Carvery. Millions of families sit down to tuck into a delicious roast dinner every week - wherever they are in the world. So ahead of Remembrance Sunday - and in a bid to help readers who tackle the job of cooking the Sunday roast each week - weve brought The Toby Carvery together with the chefs of The Royal Navy to get their top tips in the above video. Toby Carvery - the Home of the Roast - has long been a supporter of the armed forces, offering free meals to troops on Armed Forces Day.  And in the above behind-the-scenes clip on board HMS Northumberland, Toby Carvery Chef Trainer James Smith joins forces with the Royal Navys Chef Mitchell to lt the lid on how best to cook meats, roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings and even gravy. Toby Carvery Chef James hails The Royal Navy for creating that home-from-home roast dinner experience at sea in the clip, saying: For many families, roast dinners are that one time everybody gets around that dining table. A really good roast dinner is just like having a really big hug on a plate!  Meanwhile, The Royal Navys chef Mitchell explains how important the traditional meal is to troops across the world. He adds: Ive cooked for Royalty and some of the biggest dignitaries of the Armed Forces, but every Sunday - guaranteed - ships across the world are having a roast dinner. Below, weve shared the top tips from the guys on the key ingredients to help families across the country cooking up a roast. Meats  Toby Carverys Chef James says: One of the tricks we use at Toby is to bloom our meat for a minimum of four hours first of all. So we take them out of the packaging and that lets the joints re-oxigise. We then load them into ovens and cook them really slowly. Letting them rest at the end is a key step to getting perfect beef. Yorkshire puddings  Were famous for our seven centimetre Yorkshire Puddings at Toby Carvery, reveals chef James. The trick to Yorkshires is making sure youve got really hot oil. Then add your batter to the oil and get them in the oven as quickly as you can. Roast potatoes Its all about the ruffling, chef James says, shaking a tray of uncooked but peeled and chopped spuds.  You want to shake them up and make sure you break the edges of the potatoes up. Then that will give us a really nice, crisp roast potato. Gravy  Chef James says: Theres nothing worse than thin or lumpy gravy! Consider adding cranberry sauce, mustard or horseradish. Meanwhile, The Royal Navys Chef Mitchell adds: We always go for a nice smooth, thick gravy. We normally put in a bit of red wine to give it a dferent taste. Ive even put Marmite in!Find your nearest Toby Carvery at www.tobycarvery"},{"url":null,"title":"labour backs sunday peoples campaign","story":"NewsLabour backs Sunday People’s campaign to officially log war veteran suicidesJeremy Corbyn will also be unveiling new veteran support strategies on Remembrance SundayShareCommentsByKeir Mudie:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsJeremy Corbyn believes veterans need more mental health support \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour is backing the Sunday People’s campaign to make sure the suicides of servicemen are recorded by coroners. Today the party unveils its veterans strategy, showing how Labour would make things better for people leaving the armed servives. And they will urge the government to officially log numbers of veterans who commit suicide. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who will attend several events marking Remembrance Sunday, said the plan was to increase support for veterans. And he called on the government to ‘honour our commitment’ to the armed forces. Mr Corbyn said: “On Remembrance Sunday, we commemorate all those killed in war as we strive for a world of peace. We must also think of our veterans and the shocking lack of support far too many receive.  “Let today spur us into action, to give our veterans the security and support they deserve with a new social contract for veterans. The next Labour government will guarantee armed forces personnel the opportunity to have a home, to heal and to retrain when they complete their time in service. “We will do the right thing by ending the scourge of rough sleeping and helping veterans embark on new careers. “The psychological effects of war can be devastating. While many organisations do fantastic work to give mental health support, charity alone is not enough. If someone is suffering from PTSD, this should be treated as seriously as a physical injury. “We must honour our commitments to those who served in our armed forces.” Labour’s social contract for veterans includes:Ending the scandal of veterans sleeping rough on our streets with homes reserved for people with a history of rough sleeping Free education and training through the National Education Service New career opportunities through Increased apprenticeship numbers Mental health issues, like PTSD, treated as seriously as physical health issues Labour is also calling on the Government to: Officially register the number of homeless veterans, prioritise the mental health of veterans, and do more to help veterans start new careers through improved access to education and training. Nia Grfith MP, Labour’s Shadow Defence Secretary, said: “In spite of the best efforts of many of those working in the sector, too many veterans are still not getting the support that they need. “The Government’s long overdue Veterans Strategy needs to be far reaching and properly funded. It must strengthen the transition phases and implement proper joined up thinking to ensure that no veteran who needs support falls through the net. “And it needs to put in the funding so that local councils and health providers can implement the Armed Forces Covenant consistently and effectively, to ensure that veterans get the employment, housing and health support that they are entitled to.” The news comes as the government plans to launch its first ever Veterans Strategy.  MoD bosses will work with British business to find new ways of helping veterans find work when theyto civilian le. New research, due to be published next week, shows that while the public have great respect for the armed forces they think veterans are more likely to have mental health problems and have dficulty forging friendships outside the service and those perceptions unfairly harm their employment prospects. The Ministry of Defence wants to encourage businesses to hire talented and professional young men and women looking for fresh careers as theyto civilian le. The proposal will be part of the first UK wide Veteran’s Strategy, which builds on the Armed Forces Covenant to help improve access to services and improve the health and well-being of veterans. The strategy argues the Government has the responsibility to promote these skills through the Career Transition Partnership and Defence Relationship Management scheme. Its job is to promote the skills of veterans and encourage companies to take them on through the Defence Employer Recognition Scheme. That offers gold, silver and bronze awards to firms who sign up to the Armed Forces Covenant and help ex-military personnel find new jobs. However a consultation, being launched alongside the strategy, will quiz business leaders on what more can be done to prepare veterans for civilian work and what barriers stand in the way of them getting good jobs.

Standing before the Queen, Lucy Attrill summed up the mood of a nation with a poem as fitting as any to commemorate the sacrice made for us in the trenches so long ago. “If you hadn’t given your le in France  If you hadn’t stepped on that train  Your boys might have had a father  But our world might not be the same.” Its poignant lines struck the perfect chord. And the title – simply “Thank You” – resounded back down the years amid the reverent silence of London’s Royal Albert Hall. It marked the highlight of a moving service attended by Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as well as other senior royals.  Birmingham schoolgirl Lucy had written the winning poem in a Royal British Legion contest to honour the , British troops who died. Her own great-grandfather George Alfred Attrill was one of the lucky ones. He served in the Royal Navy in both world wars – the second time on a hospital ship – and survived. Lucy’s spine-tingling verse was only matched in the domed hall by Prince Harry and Meghan’s royal wedding cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason who played Hallelujah while images from the First World War were projected onto gauze screens above him. Sir Tom Jones, Tom Fletcher, Danny Jones, Sheridan Smith and The Kingdom Choir also performed, with a finale that saw thousands of poppy petals fall from the roof. The festival was one of a series of events yesterday on the eve of the th anniversary of Armistice Day.  Earlier, the Duke of Sussex was at Twickenham to lay a wreath ahead of the rugby clash between England and New Zealand. Harry also met descendants of two England captains Lancelot Slocock and Ronnie Poulton who died in the conflict. Poulton’s great nephew James Garnett said: “It was very emotional.” Yesterday also saw the end of The Long Walk Home, a four-day challenge in which  veterans walked  miles from Ypres in Belgium – the scene of three major battles – to the Cenotaph.Among the walkers was -year-old Pete Barron, a former Lieutenant Colonel with the Royal Corps of Signals for  years, and his stepson Matthew McGinn, , who still serves with the RCS. Pete, of Ludlow, Shrops, carried with him the war medals of his grandfather John Webb who survived the Somme campaign to win a Distinguished Conduct Medal.  And he also had with him a bronze medallion known as the “death penny” given to the family of his Royal Navy great uncle Albert Brown who didn’t make it home. Pete – who has raised pound, for the Haig Housing Trust which provides homes for veterans – said: “I was doing the walk he couldn’t do.” An estimated . million military personnel lost their lives in the First World War and  million were wounded.Among them was -year-old Private George Edwin Ellison from York – killed by a German sniper just  minutes before the Armistice at am on November , , that ended the four-year conflict. Today the leaders of France and Germany joined in a show of unity - holding hands and resting their heads against each other.President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met in Compiegne, France, where the Armistice was signed in a railway carriage. In the UK, silhouettes of soldiers from the First World War were projected on to famous landmarks.  The Tommies illuminated Marble Arch, Tate Modern, HMS Belfast, Warwick Castle, the Angel of the North, the Tyne Bridge, Titanic Belfast, Cardf Castle and Edinburgh Castle. General the Lord Dannatt, patron of There But Not There and ex-Chief of the General Staff, said: “It is vital we reflect on the sacrice made by an entire generation of servicemen and women. These landmarks provide a remarkable representation of the nation doing that. “We have been moved by the overwhelming public support which has led to more than poundmillion raised for military and mental health charities.”  Sunday’s events will begin at am as pipers play the traditional Scottish lament, Battle’s O’er, at , locations across the world.

It was said to include Slumdog Millionaire star Anil Kapoor and former Miss World and Bride and Prejudice star Aishwarya Rai, along with Bunty Walla, Sanjay Dutt, Deepika Padukone and Karishma Kapoor. Mr Ahmed claims he offered to organise one-to-one meetings at locations in Dubai and India. But he said: “In spite of the endless amounts of cash he was willing to spend on his obsession, the payments suddenly dried up.”  Mr Ahmed claims the sheikh – a cousin of the King of Bahrain, who has a net worth of pound.billion – agreed to pay more than pound.million per star meeting. He also claims he agreed each meeting would last no longer than  minutes and the sheikh offered a bonus of pound, for every third successful meeting. However, Mr Ahmed alleges after meeting four actors, including Ranveer Singh and “King Khan” Shah Rukh Khan in , he failed to turn up to two more then backed out, having paid just pound.million.  And he claims the sheikh pulled out of a pound, deal to sponsor The Times of India Film Awards – India’s equivalent of our BAFTAs. Mr Ahmed said: “I was shocked then to find he had met with  shyfurther Bollywood stars in eight days shortly after he terminated our agreement. Given the positive relationship I felt we had built up during our work, I feel betrayed.”  Mr Ahmed is suing for damages arising partly from breach of contract. But Sheikh Hamad’s team denies a formal agreement was ever made. In court papers, the sheikh’s defence claims he was told each shyencounter would cost pound, to pound, but was later told meeting Shah Rukh Khan would cost ten times that amount. He claims Mr Ahmed “put unfair pressure” on him for large sums of money and he felt “threatened”. He also said the meetings were set up at inconvenient times. Sheikh Hamad has declined to comment.

Sue and Noel Radford are said to be smitten with newborn daughter Bonnie Raye, who was born on Tuesday weighing lb oz after a swt -minute labour. The couples  other children are also equally delighted and all lined up ready to hold her as she was welcomed into the familys -bed home in Morecambe, Lancashire, on Wednesday. Sue, , told The Sun: “We’ve both decided we don’t want any more. Bonnie has completed our family.” And Noel, , added: “Some people decide to stop after two or three kids. We’ve made it after .”  Sue has also insisted she will not miss being pregnant - and the maternity clothes are going in the bin. She added: “All the midwives at the hospital were askingthey would see us again next year and we both said, ‘definitely not’. “We’re just going to keep enjoying the children and enjoy our grandchildren.” The pair revealed they were expecting baby number  in May by posting a video message on YouTube and an ultrasound image of the unborn girl on Instgram. When the couple welcomed their lb oz son Archie in September last year, they vowed the little boy would be their last and they were happy to finish on a nice even number.

The childhood sweethearts first child, Chris, was born when Sue was aged just .  Sue and Noel were both given up for adoption after they were born, and they decided to keep Chris and raise him as teenage parents. They got married and had their second child, Sophie, when Sue was . Noel even had a vasectomy, later reversed, after baby number nine. The pair face a monumental task each day just to feed, clothe and ferry about their huge brood.

In addition, they also have a holiday abroad each year.

As well as sunshine for most of the UK, temperatures are set to be higher than average for this time of year.  Met Office Meteorologist Sophie Yeomans said: Its been a rainy one today, with some places experiencing the odd rumble of thunder and lightning strike. Most of the showers will die out throughout the night into the dawn. Early on a band of heavy showers will be heading through the south west of England and Wales.  The band of rain will then head northeastwards towards Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. Going into Sunday, it will be a day of sunshine and showers - but more of a scattering. Youll be unlucky to come across a shower, most of the country will be treated to sunny spells. Highs of C are expected in the south, further northwest C with parts of Scotland only reaching C.  Starting the ceremonies, Prince Harry laid the first cross of remembrance at Westminster Abbey on Thursday. He honoured the two minute silence that was held after the Last Post at the Abbeys Field of Remberance. Dressed in unorm, the Duke of Sussex saluted in front of the crowd.

Mummied beetles were also among artefacts found in seven tombs discovered over the past six months on the edge of the King Userkaf pyramid complex at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara, south of Cairo. As they were preparing the site to present the latest discoveries, archaeologists found the door of another tomb that remains sealed, secretary-general of Egypts Supreme Council of Antiquities Mostafa Waziri said. The tomb dates from the Fth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom and is unusual because the facade and door are intact.  That means its contents may still be untouched, said Mohamed Youssef, director of the Saqqara area. He said experts plan to open the tomb in the coming weeks. The Fth Dynasty ruled Egypt from about , BC to , BC, not long after the great pyramid of Giza was built. The tombs lie in a buried ridge that has only partially been uncovered and could offer many more similar discoveries, Waziri said.  Excavations in the area had halted in  before resuming earlier this year. Saqqara served as the necropolis for Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt for more than two millennia.  Ancient Egyptians mummied humans to preserve their bodies for the afterle, while animal mummies were used as religious offerings. Dozens of cat mummies and gilded statues of cats were unearthed, including a bronze statue dedicated to the cat goddess Bastet.  Two large scarabs wrapped in linen and in very good condition were found inside a limestone sarcophagus with a vaulted, decorated lid, the antiquities ministry said in a statement. Another collection of scarab mummies was found inside a smaller sarcophagus.  Thescarab is something really unique. It is something really a bit rare, Waziri said. A couple of days ago, when we discovered those coffins, they were sealed coffins with drawings of scarabs. I never heard about them before.  The team also found painted wooden cobra and crocodile sarcophagi, a collection of gilded statues depicting animal features, as well as objects including amulets, canopic jars, writing tools and papyri baskets.

Putting pen to paper, terried Renia Spiegel pleaded with God to live, tragically saying: Ive experienced so little of le. The harrowing diary entries were penned by the Polish Jewish schoolgirl during the Second World War - shed started in , aged , shortly before fighting began, Mail Online reports. And for  years her words were unheard after being locked away when neither her mother Roza or younger sister Ariana, who survived the concentration camps, could bring themselves to read them.  The -page diary lay dormant until Arianas daughter, Alexandra Bellak, decided to send it for translation. In one entry, dated June   - two months before she was shot in a Nazi ghetto - Renia wrote: Wherever I look, there is bloodshed. Such terrible pogroms. There is killing, murdering. God Almighty, for the umpteenth time I humble myself in front of you, help us, save us! Lord God, let us live, I beg You, I want to live! Ive experienced so little of le. I dont want to die. Im scared of death. Its all so stupid, so petty, so unimportant, so small. Today Im worried about being ugly tomorrow I might stop thinking forever.  Set against a horrying backdrop of war and anti-Semitic violence, the entries also capture struggles of a normal teenager navigating her way closer to adulthood before her future was cruelly ripped away. Compared to Anne Franks, the diary began in January  and ended on the last day of Renias le, July  , when she was executed by German soldiers. The final lines were written by her boyfriend Zygmus Schwarzer, who gave a harrowing account of her death, and that of his parents. Now,  years after her murder, the diary has been published in full by St Martins Press, and segments have appeared in Smithsonian magazine.  Through her diary, Renia tells of how she spent most of the war in Przemyśl, in southern Poland, away from her mother and sister who were in Warsaw, pursuing an acting career for the young girl. But when war broke out in September , Renias mother found herself under Nazi command while her beloved daughter and her grandparents were taken into Soviet occupation. For months, Renia details how Jews were rounded up and packed onto trains in the middle of the night to be taken to their deaths into labour camps deep in Russia. Amid the horror, she describes meeting her first and only love - who ended up being the reason her diary survived. She pens detailed accounts of their first kiss, and second, saying: It felt so nice, but you know, it wasnt fiery or wild, but somehow delicate and careful, almost fearful - aswe didnt want to extinguish something that was growing between us. She added: I love those green eyes. We kissed for the second time today.Their romance, which seemed to flurry between on and off every other week, was quickly interrupted by war.Days after their second kiss, Reina wrote on June : I cant write. Im weak with fear. War again, war between Russia and Germany. The Germans were here, then they retreated. Horrible days in the basement. Dear Lord, give me my Mamma, save all of us who have stayed here and those who escaped the city this morning. Save us, save Zygus.A whirlwind of violence followed, with executions by Nazi authorities commonplace and Jews forced to wear armbands at all times.Then, in , Renia was locked inside a ghetto along with some , other Jews, watched over by Nazi guards day and night.In her diary, she vividly described her despair and misery while living there, though still finding joy spending time in the garden with her love.  But again any happiness that remained was replaced by the horrors of the genocide, as ghetto police demanded enormous fees from all residents - deportation to a death camp was the penalty for failure to pay.The final entry was made on July   by Zygus, who wrote that his world was ending.Three shots! Three lives lost! It happened last night at .pm.Fate decided to take my dearest ones away from me. My le is over.All I can hear are shots, shots shots....My dearest Renusia, the last chapter of your diary is complete. Zygus was taken to Auschwitz but managed to survive being examined by Dr Mengele - who performed deadly examinations on prisoners and deemed who was fit to work in the camps, or who would be sent to the gas chambers to be killed.The young boy fled to New York with Renias mother Roza and sister Ariana to start a new le with new names as Catholics. In the s, Zygus tracked them down and gave them the diary - but still too distraught to read it, the family kept it locked in a safety deposit box in a Chase bank in Manhattan.It was only when Ariana told her own daughter Alexandra about it, that its contents started to be revealed.She became fixated on learning about her aunt, and in  sent extracts to a Polish student to translate."},{"url":null,"title":"1000 arabs expected in dingwall as dundee united sell out ross county ticket allocation","story":"Dundee United have sold out their allocated tickets for the Championship clash against Ross County in the Highlands.Arabs have backed their side in huge numbers since Robbie Neilson took over last month.The Tangerines have snapped up the -ticket allocation given to them for the game in Dingwall but fans can also get them at the ground and many more are expected to cheer on their side.Up to , Terrors are expected and are sure to give a vocal backing for their side in what is, arguably, the biggest game of the season as they look to close the gap on leaders Ayr United.United took , Arabs with them to their last away game at Dunfermline and the resurgent support has been duly noted.According to the Federation of Dundee United Supporters# Clubs, buses to every away game have been full since Neilson took charge.A brief statement read [sic]: #Committee meeting tonight and it was pointed out every bus has been fully booked by the start of the week since Robbie took over.#Great effort Arabs.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

The infamous #Jacobs Report# was published in , proposing six options, of which the government chose the cheapest for reasons of #cost-effectiveness#.The option selected would involve the installation of mitigation netting along with the upgrading of the old road at the foot of Glen Croe.Road closures, however, have continued as material has to be cleared and netting repaired after every major slip # adding to the cost each time.The ongoing work has failed to satisfy many people living locally, and following last months closure Jane Gauld, owner of the Slanj restaurant in Tarbet, launched an online petition to press for  a more permanent solution in the form of a bypass tunnel through the hills.Earlier this week more than , people had signed the petition.And, in a rare show of unity Argyll and Bute Council members last month voted unanimously to press for government action for a permanent solution the the Rest problem.One prominent campaigner for a permanent engineering solution at the Rest has been Inveraray hotelier Donald Clark, who said: # This should have been achieved many years ago. Mitigation lessens damage and closures but never guarantees full protection.#The choice of using the Old Military Road as a ersion route was the cheapest option in The Jacobs Report and was a flawed choice.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13549120.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS134733004.jpg","title":"ayrs station hotel cannot afford","story":"NewsAyrs Station Hotel cannot afford more delay, says MSP Brian WhittleOfficials have been urged to make a quick decision on the future of the Station Hotel, with some trains now running south of the town againShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsStation Hotel \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA decision on the future of Ayr’s Station Hotel must not be kicked down the road, insists an MSP. Brian Whittle says officials must act with more urgency than ever following the resumption of services south of the town. The surprise call to send trains back on the route to Stranraer was made by ScotRail bosses on Thursday. Their decision followed a morning test run on the track beneath the crumbling hotel. But South of Scotland member, Mr Whittle, warned: “Just because the trains are running again, no-one should feel we can put off making a decision about the Station Hotel’s future. “A general unwillingness by South Ayrshire Council and others to think about the future of the building were what got us into this mess and I’m not prepared to see action put off again. “The Station Hotel can’t be allowed to sit abandoned for a minute more than is necessary to make the decision. “People who rely on the railway can’t afford any more dithering and delay.”  Work to stabilise the B-Listed structure continues this week with a scaffolding being erected. One source close to the works said: “The roof is a big problem and is nowhere near being tackled yet. “It remains to be seen what the structural engineers will want to do but saving it is a very big job.” Limited services are now running to Stranraer for the first time since council chiefs threw up an exclusion zone in August. Buses will continue to operate for the services that haven’t been reintroduced, and for services between Ayr and Girvan. The existing timetable for services between Ayr and Glasgow Central remains in place. Alex Hynes, ScotRail Alliance managing director, said: “We know it has been a challenging time for our customers, so we are pleased to be able to restore some services between Ayr and Stranraer. “We are working flat out with South Ayrshire Council and our task force partners to get all services to and from Ayr back to normal as soon as possible.” Bill Reeve, chair of Ayr Station Task Force, added: “Theof rail passenger services between Stranraer and Ayr is a welcome step towards resolving this issue. “While we remain mindful there is still work to be done to restore the complete service it is good that hard work by both South Ayrshire Council and the ScotRail Alliance has now made this first step possible. “The Task Force partners continue to work together to ensure we can bring back a full timetable as quickly as possible and we thank businesses, commuters and the local community for their continued patience while we do.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire.

The Tower will be bathed in a sea of poppy red from pm tonightas part of South Ayrshire Councils events. The uplighting on the Tower was recently replaced with colour changing LED lighting, providing the opportunity to illuminate the prominent building at night – and change the colour of the lighting for special occasions. Remembrance weekend will be the first time the new lighting system has been put into operation – following successful tests earlier in the week – with the building staying red throughout Armistice Day until the early hours of Monday, November .

Community organisations and groups, churches, knitting groups, day care centres and iniduals across South Ayrshire all took up the call to action to contribute poppies for the banner – signicantly exceeding the target of , poppies to mark the centenary year. And many others, such as schools and council staff, took the time to help tie donated poppies on to the banner, so they could be displayed in all their glory. South Ayrshire has also been selected to take part in a national commemoration to mark the  years since the end of the First World War.Ayr beach has been chosen as one of a handful of locations in Scotland for the national Pages of the Sea project, which is a UK-wide initiative – led by film director Danny Boyle – to pay tribute to all those who left our shores during the war.The project is based around the creation of stunning sand portraits of iniduals who lost their lives during the First World War – for Ayr, the portrait will be Second Lieutenant Walter Tull. Pages of the Sea is very much a community event and people are invited to come along between .am and amand pay tribute to all those who left our shores during the war. There will also be a change to recite a poem written especially for the event. Guided tours of Rozelle Remembrance Woodland and its incredible wood carvings of characters and features associated with our armed forces and previous battles will also be provided over the weekend, starting from Rozelle House at pm on Saturday  and Sunday, November . The tour will include the chance to see a brand-new carving marking the centenary of both the RAF and Armistice Day and the opportunity to place remembrance poppy crosses or long-stemmed poppiesin the woodland in memory of loved ones and all those lost in battle. Rozelle House is also showcasing a small Armistice Day Centenary Exhibition, which runs until Monday, December .

The council will shell out pound on hospitality for the delegation from the large city of Liaocheng in mid November. A report presented to councillors said the experience offered would cater for Chinese “preferences for retail and photo opportunities.” Chief executive Eileen Howat said: “The initial visit would be used as a scene setter and identy common aspects” between the two locations. Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “Across the world China is a huge player in the economic infrastructure.” The Scotland-China Innovation and Technology Association have spotted similarities between South Ayrshire and Liaocheng. The delegation, which includes the Liaocheng Mayor, will also visit Edinburgh and St Andrews. The city is located in the western Shandong province of China. Councillor William Grant said: “I think there is tremendous potential to work with one of the big players in the world.” The report put before councillors said the itinerary would offer a flavour of South Ayrshire in terms of culture, tourism, business and education. The report said: “It is anticipated that the overall itinerary will result in a highly positive and memorable experience for the Chinese delegates.” They will arrive on November  for two days on the quest to find a twin region in Scotland.

The incident along with other concerns has sparked a proposed shake-up of taxi and private hire rules. The middle seat in the front could be ditched from fleets of larger vehicles following a public consultation. The public are going to be askedpeople should still be allowed to sit in the front of vehicles. The consultation will also questionthe number of passengers sitting up front should be reduced to one. South Ayrshire Council’s Leadership Panel heard last week how the middle passenger was seated too close to drivers. A report presented to councillors said the close proximity left drivers open to accusations of “inappropriate conduct. Explaining one incident reported to the council,licensing team leader Morag Douglas said: “There were concerns that a driver was threatened by young girls who booked a private hire. “They left without paying and stated thatthe driver took any action the driver would be reported to the police for inappropriate conduct.” She said the council received other gripes from drivers about what a tight squeeze it is with two passengers in the front. Ms Douglas told how drivers said having “two larger people in the front seats” meant it is dficult to control the car without touching middle seat passengers. All eight seater vehicles licensed by the council have two passenger seats in the front and six in the back. Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “It is as much about protecting the drivers as the passengers.” He added: “We need to be cautious and make sure that whatever we come up with doesn’t have unintended consequences.” Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils don’t permit passengers in the front seats of taxis. Feedback from South Ayrshire Taxi and Private Hire Operators’ Forum members suggested the inidual drivers should decidethey want passengers up front. The members also told the council there should still be an option to have two passengers seated in the front. There are  licensed taxis and  private hire vehicles in South Ayrshire. The specicationsapproved would only apply to newly licenced vehicles.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGlasgowAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13556455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS69111168.jpg","title":"tributes paid ayr united legend","story":"NewsTributes paid to Ayr United legend Johnny Graham, who dies aged The Somerset Park legend died last week, aged , and tributes have been led by former teammate Jim McSherry.ShareByMike Wilson:,  NOV NewsJohnny Graham at a packed Somerset Park\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWarm tributes are being paid to Johnny Graham, the skipper who led Ayr United into the first ever Premier League.

I remember when Ayr beat Rangers - that first season all the headlines went to Johnny Doyle but Graham gave a masterclass in midfield. He was a terric player and a leader.” Terracing fans posted emotional messages on Facebook as they mourned the loss of the Somerset Park legend. Honest Man veteran Lawrence Grace wrote: “RIP to one of the greatest players to wear an Ayr strip.” Ronnie Hainey added: “One of my favourite players and one of the best.” Robert Somerville said: “Sad news. True Ayr legend, penalty king and all round great.” Allan Durward recalled: “I’ve great memories of the ‘s as a boy, Johnny Graham, Ingram, Doyle, McCulloch, etc. RIP.”  Johnny began his career with Strathclyde Juniors before going on to play for Third Lanark, Dundee United, Falkirk and Hibs. He joined Ayr for pound, in  and went on to score  goals in  games. In October of his first season, he scored all four as Ayr came from - down to beat Airdrie - at Broomfield. Amazingly, he repeated the four goal haul in the second last game that same season when Ayr beat Partick Thistle - at Somerset. Ally handed him the captaincy in - and great times continued as Ayr beat Dunfermline - in April  – player of the year Johnny scored twice – to secure a place in the inaugural Premier League. Graham twice played for the Scottish Football League XI. He ed to Falkirk at the start of season - but within two years came back to Ayr as reserve team coach.

They will both have entrances facing out over the car park beside Boots and have attracted seven objections. Landowner Red Button is already quids in after getting permission to reduce the size of the car park and build a Costa coffee unit. But planners say only two car parking spaces will be lost in this application. Originally it was planned to build just one larger store on the loading area but permission has now lapsed. A report before next Thursday’s South Ayrshire Council planning committee says: “It’s considered the proposal will not have an adverse impact on the residential character or amenity of the locality. “Accordingly, the application is recommended for approval.” Objectors in Academy Street and Academy Court have hit out over traffic concerns, the impact on local homes, of servicing the other units and why the town needs more retail space when some units are empty. Resident Mark Inglis called for the entrance into the entire precinct to be shted to Portland Street. He said: “There are around  children who are being dropped off and picked up or making their own way to school or nursery and the additional traffic will increase the risk of signicant harm to children. “There is also a sheltered housing complex directly opposite the proposed development with some infirm and elderly people within, the additional traffic on Academy Street I believe will also pose a risk to them and their well being, and increased risk of accident and perhaps fatality.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"and-the-winner-of-pet-idol-2018-is","story":"AFTER months of voting, we can now reveal the winner of Pet Idol  is..... eight-year-old Alaskan Malamute, Ava.Readers of the Borderand our sister paper the Peeblesshire News voted in their hundreds for their favourite pet this year.And owner Sandra McConnell, who lives in Hall Street Innerleithen, is \"delighted\" to have scooped the pound prize and the coveted title.She told us: \"I am absolutely delighted Ava has won the competition.\"My friend Claire Mahon sent in the entry form for me as we just fancied giving it a go this year.\"We are very pleased people have voted for Ava ndash she is such a lovely dog, with a nice nature.\"Sandra, who is a night support worker at St Ronans House in Innerleithen, got Ava when she was a pup from a breeder in Kilmarnock.She added: \"I would like to thank everyone who voted.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

I also have a mm-m Canon, which is a great lens but I havenrsquot used it as often as I thought I would.ldquoI always use a tripod and a remote control when Irsquom doing serious pictures ndash I prefer not to hand-hold the camera in that sort of situation, involving long exposures.

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees. All the species are beautul. There is such a range of colourful berries and they are a hardy plant. In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

Well, my comrade, here I am sitting in my ldquodug out after after our evening meal, and before I lie downI just want to have a few quiet minutesrsquo chat with you.

Tonight, of course, is the great night for fireworks at home, and out heremdashno doubt that they might show that they really did remember the th of Novembermdashthe brigade on our left arranged to send up dozens of red rockets at . p.m., to be followed by rapid rle and machine-gun firemdash in the hopes of catching the Germans lining their parapets. Well, at . I went out into the most perfect starry night I have seen since Loos, I stood looking up at the Plough and Pole Star when the rockets began. They really were very pretty, but were answered by dozens flares and star shells from the Germans that showed up the country all around. Then the rles and machine guns cracked out for a few minutes. Thousands of rounds were loosed off and probably no one was hurt. It is perfectly marvellous how much lead and old iron can fly about and how little damage it does.I have been in these trenches since Tuesday and daily we must have had thousands of rounds of rle and machine-gain fire and from a dozen twenty shells mdash high explosive and shrapnel - sent over us and amongst us and not a single one of mv men has been hit and no harm has been done. It is rather wonderful, but makes one think about the appalling waste there is in war. What an amount of money is spent on all that ammunition! How little harmmdashcomparativelymdashit does! If all this money could have been spent on social work, what Heaven we might have had earth today! And yet mdashI wonder.One learns much here with these death-dealing missiles around that I fancy we could never learn at home. Somehow I feel it is all for good. We are getting lessons and experiences brought to us out here that a letime social work couldnrsquot teach to home. Loos has made men the more or less happy-go-lucky lads I brought out here. It has taught them what Brotherhood is. It has brought it to the surface and cemented it as nothing  could. And le altogether has new, fuller meaning to us. We have been through the crucible, have looked Death m the face and have learned that you can do that without any fear but the most wonderful calm and peace. The experience was awful yet subline.While shells were dropping amongst us and around us we were conscious of the most wonderful uplting, and ldquoPeace, perfect Peace, were the words that seemed to breathe through me with the most wonderfully calming effect. And here, amid rain and mud, with over two feet of water to wade through in places in the trenches, with trench walls and parapets falling down with the rain, everyone is happy and cheerful and anxious assist ever other one and share with the others in a way that makes one feel that Brotherhood here is reality. There is no lack of discipline, but very strong bonds of real affection amongst us. Oh, it has been grand experiencemdashrain, mud, wet, and everything. I wouldnt have missed it all for anything. And yet I long to home. I long for the war to endmdashto be finished with it all. And inside myself I feel it will end when the lessons it is meant teach are learnt, are brought right home to the world largemdashand not till then, All things work together for good. Yes this ghastly war, too. It has taught us many lessons: through and through the loss of loved ones it will teach millions of others.

In a few words, the Germans and us have shaken hands it is no lie and not in the least exaggerated. I will try and explain how all came about. Thu enemyand us are only fteen yards apart in this particular point. We have been conversing with each other for a few days now, but on the morning of November  we were a little more brave, showing our headswe then showed more of our bodies until they and us were completely visible. They invited us over and we invited them, and after a bit of arguing from each side advanced they shook hands, and immediately a German officer rushed forward and the hand of the British Tommy that had stepped forward bravely. They cheered and we did likewise, and, Mr. Editor, believe me, I never felt so delighted in my existence.They gave us cigarettes but refused ours, as they said they had plenty of tabac and cigarettes, and I might mention they looked cleaner and better cleaner and better clad than us. A few remarks passed by them are as follows: ldquoWe no shoot, you no shoot ldquoWar no good ldquoBombs no good. After about an hour of this their officer asked us to go in some of our chaps didnrsquot seem to like the idea, so he ordered one of his men to fire a shot, but of course well over our heads. I expect the reason he had to do this was some Von Gabberstown would be visiting and then no doubt it would be serious for himthe big unrsquos heard about this. Now what will the English Press critics think when they know that these men are the very people who were anxious to cut us upndash the Baians  Itrsquos a clear smack in the mouth for those who are trying to turn the English race against the whole German race, and it proves that the German soldier is only as bad as he is made by his oppressors. It shows that your paper is the only paper worth reading, the only paper of principle, and the only thing that preaches the proper thing ndash Right before might.I must now close, so wishing you, your staff and paper every success. I have pleasure in beinga supporter of your ideals.Driving the Germans Back, A bitter Struggle: A Mossend Manrsquos Experience.Dr. Barron, House, is in receipt of the following from S. S. James Mlsquollwraith, , C Coy., Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, British Expeditionary Force:mdashJust a few lines to let you lot know that I am still pushing along as usual. I hope you are well. I expect you are kept pretty busy and will not have much more time than ourselves at present. The other night we had a pretty lively time here. I never witnessed anything like it since the war started: It was a pure picture. The heavens were illuminated for miles along the whole battle-front. I tell you for truth that a worm could not have escaped instant death. However, we are beginning to enjoy it, with the sound of the guns never out of our ears.When we are having our little bit of meat we have to stand outside in the open, becauseyou go into a house you get twice tile quantity you should have in your mess tin it is filled with dirt or dust. The people here go about their work the same as in peace time. They are ploughing the land for their crops as usual, while the shells are screaming over their heads like seagulls. They are, like us, are getting used to it.There is not much improvement as far as I can see but for the last eight or ten days there have been some bitter engagements fought with the same results to the Germans. Our men are far the better class in a hand-to-hand struggle, and there is nothing earth to stand against our rle fire. It is, like our bayonet work, most deadly. It is horrible after a bayonet charge. I would as soon shoot for a year as use the baronet for an hour. It must, be done and the Germans must get it. We canrsquot, nor will not, show any sympathy to a German, matter what rank holds. We are fed up them. Germans Left out of .Thrilling Narrative from the Front. We are in receipt the following from Private John Mclnrue, nd Sherwood Foresters:mdashlt gives me great pleasure to write you this, and I trust it gives you the same to read it. As I- have started to communicate with many of my old friends through your paper I hope they are all enjoying the very best health as this leaves me in the pink. The weather is on its best behaviour, and I can tell you it is a treat out here at present. When have a holiday out of the trenches and have walk about this-mdashwhich was once a beautulmdashtown, it is most refreshing.To describe the town would be nearly impossible. Just imagineyou started on walk from the North British Station, Bellshill, to Holy town, and you met nothing but soldiers, and every house had its windows smashed, every second or third house had large holes in the walls made by the ldquocoalboxes, in the middle of the street engineers filling up the holes in the roadway, the churches and schools and all prominent buildings completely lowered to the ground, and week in, week out, you are in the midst of cannons roaring from morn till night. It makes our blood boil sometimes when we think of the ruin caused the Germans. It is not the towns alone that catch all this no all the villages, and even he farmhouses, get the German ldquocoalbox, but the time is not far distant when we will bring them to their senses.I think one of the finest sights I ever saw in my le was on the th of this month, about - p.m., but, before letting you know about it, I must tell you that both our and the German artillery fire very little during the night because the flare of the gun, which could be seen for miles, would give their positions away. On this occasion, we were busy numbering our sentries off for the night, when, all of a sudden, about two hundred cannons started from over the lines and our guns started in answer. Thu night was pitch dark, and  to  miles off the enemy thought they had discovered some weak spot our chain trenches, so their Infantry made a charge.Up went the searchlights, star shells, and rockets, and the shells exploding in the air. It was a sight. We would have enjoyed it better had we known that there would be no casualty list, but there was nevertheless, was a sight I will never forget. I was saying, their Infantry made a charge but they didnrsquot get through.  got theof our comradesrsquo trenches, and only  survived so they paid dearly for the mistake they made in thinking there was any weak links in our chain. But, mind you, the Germans are no weaklings they are just a little obstinate, and think that all things earth should belong to them, but they can get no further. In the place where, our regiment is, I could stake my le that the whole German Army could not get through in daylight, and, mind you, we are only  yards from their trenches. But supposing there was no opposition to them, it would take them about three hours to cover the distance.I cannot mention the name the town we are in, but it is, or was, a very large city, just about as large as Glasgow. I donrsquot want to take up too much of your valuable time at present, I intend on sending you another note shortly.

But in , Countess Haig, we of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, suggested that a factory, employing those men disabled by war, should be created to make poppies for Scotland. First based in an old wood-chopping factory in the grounds of Whitefoord House in Edinburgh, it moved in  to an old printing works in the city’s Warriston Road.And after this year’s very special Armistice centenary year, the factory will be on the move again – albeit on a temporary basis.A team of around  ex-servicemen and women who hand-assemble more than five million poppies and , wreaths every year for the Scottish Poppy Appeal will be moving to Redford Barracks for two years to allow for a much-needed refurbishment of the factory.The aim is not to rip out the heart of what is a very special workplace – boasting regimental flags and thank you letters and posters from the thousands of school children who have visited.But some £. million from the Libor Fund – fines imposed on banks for manipulation of Libor levels – will ensure the factory is fit for the st Century.Overseeing the move immediately after this year’s Remembrance Day will be factory manager Charlie Pelling, who has been at the helm since .During a tour of the factory, Charlie explained more about the move.He said: “We’ll be moving on November  with the aim of being operational by the start of January.“The aim is to be back at our factory in time for the  or  appeal.“We have a small window of opportunity to make the move as the factory operates year round.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buteman webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Special year...for PoppyScotland with Gordon Michie, its head of fundraising, hoping to raise an additional #, from the  Poppy Pledge campaign. \"  \"  Armistice : PoppyScotland’s  Poppy Pledge campaign viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"“We are like a toy shop in that we work  months of the year with sales throughout that period but our sales climax in the run-up to Remembrance Day in the way a toy shop does at Christmas.“We’ve got to strip out asbestos from the factory, update the heating and wiring, modernise the windows and install a lt to the first floor.“We have to make the factory health and safety compliant and fit for purpose for the st Century.”Charlie is also hopeful that they will be able to create a learning facility.He said: “Thousands of visitors tour the factory every year – from pensioners to pre-schoolers.“Around  school children visit the factory each year, with the same number of adults too.“We want to create an educational facility where they learn about the factory before touring the site.”The workers who power the factory will, however, remain at its beating heart and will be involved in the refurbishment and move.“We have records for more than  servicemen and women who have worked here,” said Charlie. “Since , we’ve had in excess of  workers.“The factory exists to provide employment for ex service personnel who may otherwise struggle to find employment.“They work year round to ensure that enough poppies are created for the Poppy Appeal and for the many wreaths laid at ceremonies across the country.“The move to Redford Barracks will undoubtedly be challenging.“But we’ve got a plan and some very good people here so we’re confident we’ll do it and still be able to create all the poppies for .“The fact we don’t have a modern production line is something we cherish.

Danny Renowdenfeels at home at the factory, where he has worked part time since Decemver . He hopes, in future, toto college to become a counsellor and help other veterans who find themselves in his position. Previously housing a printing press, it somehow feels like home – not least because we are warmly welcomed like old friends.It’s a special year for the veterans, marking  years since the end of World War One and the creation of a unique anniversary poppy.But the pressure is largely off when we visit as the majority of the five million or so poppies created for this year’s appeal have already been despatched.Work continues apace, though, as staff finish off wreath orders which will be laid at ceremonies theand breadth of the country.The team are, however, more than happy to give us a tour and tell us about their own experiences.David Adamson is our very informative tour guide.The -year-old, who was in the army for  years and thereafter the police for , has worked at the factory for the last seven years.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.deesidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"At the helm...Charlie Pelling, manager of Lady Haigs Poppy Factory in Edinburgh, is preparing for a temporary move to Redford Barracks, which will start on November . \"  \"  Armistice : Lady Haig Poppy Factory is on the move viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"He said: “I finished with the police on the Saturday and started working here on the Monday and have been here ever since.“I’m now one of the official tour guides and I thoroughly enjoy it.“It’s been fascinating for me finding out about the history of the poppy and what it means to people.“Most of the stuff up on the walls has been presented to us by visitors and military organisations.“Around  school kids also visit every year and they love every minute of it.“It can be like herding cats at times but they always ask really interesting questions and we’re often surprised by the knowledge they have.“We show them how to make the poppies and tell them that our numbers are on the back of each box sold.“Soyou ever see school children looking at the back of the box, they’re looking for our numbers – mine is .”On a whistletop tour, we discover how the poppies are printed and cut out on  year old printing presses – left in the building when the Lady Haig Poppy Factory relocated from the grounds of Whitefoord House in  to the city’s Warriston Road.Lapel poppies may no longer be cut by hand but each one is still handcrafted.The paper from which the poppies is made arrives into the factory in large rolls.These are passed through the cutting and pressing machine and the poppy petals cut to size.Then the team add the distinctive ribbing which makes the Scottish poppy unique, before they start assembling them.Around one million stick on poppies and four million green stem poppies are produced each year.And visitors are always given a chance to make their own which school children, in particular, love, as testied by the many letters and posters on the walls.David, who has three children and seven grandchildren, added: “The bairns lap this place up.“They love making the poppies then they go back to school, do a project and send in posters or letters for our walls. We’ve not got a lot of space but we try to display as many as we can.“Instilling a sense of pride in the poppy in future generations is one of the things I love most about working here.”David and his colleagues also display personal mementoes, some of which serve to remind them of just how much their work means.Thomas McPhillipswas a Royal Corps of Signals radio operator in the s.His grandfather, William Anthony, a Lance Corporal with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, died at Passchendaele on July , .And a picture of his cousin’s son, Gary O’Donnell from South Queensferry, now also takes pride of place on his desk.He explained: “Gary was killed trying to defuse a Taliban bomb in Afghanistan in September  he was only .“In  he was awarded the George Medal for bravery demonstrated in Iraq. “He was awarded another George Medal postumously in March . He is one of the few soldiers to receive two.“I keep Gary’s picture on my desk, just in case my head ever goes down a bit.“That rarely happens here, though. It’s a lovely place to work. “I’ve been here for  years and it’s just like being back in the barracks. I love it.”One of the youngest recruits, Danny Renowden joined the army when he was just  years old.He served for seven years, including a tour in Afghanistan in  which later resulted in his medical discharge in January  due to post traumatic stress disorder .The -year-old initially applied for a job with PoppyScotland which put him in touch with the Poppy Factory.He said: “I emailed in my CV and, within a matter of minutes, Charlie Pelling, the factory manager, replied asking me to come in.“He offered me a job right away. I’ve been here, part-time, since December .”It’s the perfect fit for Danny who, for health reasons, wanted to ease back into employment.He said: “It’s giving me the routine that I really needed but in a workplace that feels like second nature.“Everyone has been in the military so that camaraderie is already there.“They are a great bunch eventhey do like winding me up because I’m originally from Cornwall!”The factory’s flexibility is ideal for dad-of-one Danny who hopes, in future, to help veterans who find themselves in his position.He added: “I’d like to go into counselling veterans but I need to go back to college.“I joined up when I was  and only have my high school education. So I’m looking into doing part-time or night classes, while working here.“For me, the factory has given me back some of the confidence I needed to consider a new career. There’s no pressure or stress andyou’re having a bad day, that’s fine. It’s allowed.”For more information on the poppy factory’s work and products, visit the website at www.ladyhaigspoppyfactory.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"armistice 100 poppyscotland s 1918 poppy

commemorating  years since Armistice, the Lady Haig Poppy Factory in Edinburgh created a special centenary poppy for PoppyScotlands annual fundraising campaign. Money raised during the Scottish Poppy Appeal is used to provide vital, le-changing support to the Armed Forces community living in Scotland.And overseeing the campaign is Gordon Michie, head of fundraising at PoppyScotland whose Edinburgh headquarters at New Haig House neighbour the Poppy Factory.He is hoping this year’s special Armistice centenary poppies and a  Poppy Pledge will bring in even more money this year.He said: “More than  organisations have signed up to the pledge to raise £ in this special anniversary year.“It’s our most ambitious fundraising campaign to date and we hope it will bring in an additional £, for the Poppy Appeal.”Gordon, a Fer who served in the RAF from  to , first volunteered with PoppyScotland ten years ago.He was appointed two and a half years ago and feels like he is back in service again.“I was only  when I came out of the RAF so I never viewed myself as a veteran,” he said. “When I started volunteering, I began wearing my veterans badge.“Now I make sure I wear it with pride daily.”While Gordon is now employed by PoppyScotland, it’s clear that the role is more than a job to him.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.midlothianadvertiser webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Dalkeith pavilion which was set on fire.

Not all schools can come to Edinburgh so we want to take the factory to them from April .”To find out more about the work PoppyScotland does, visit the website at www.poppyscotland.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"cala homes returns to inverurie with the grove","story":"A brand new pocket of exclusive homes has been unveiled in Inverurie, as CALA Homes makes a long awaitedto the popular town.The Grove’, located off Crawford Road, is a collection of  four and five bedroom detached luxury homes which enjoys an elevated position overlooking the picturesque rolling countryside.Ideally suited to families looking to lay down roots or find their forever home, the development boasts a tree-lined frontage, plenty of open green space, and a private children’s playpark, as well as benefiting from all the nearby amenities of Inverurie and easy access to the A.Fraser Carr, Sales and Marketing Director at CALA Homes , said: “It has been many years since CALA built in Inverurie, and this is the first time we’ve created family homes in the town, so we’re thrilled to launch The Grove.“We have had a warm association with Inverurie for a number of years through our sponsorship of Inverurie Locos Works football club and Garioch Sports Centre, so we’re delighted to be adding to the strong sense of community spirit in the town with this exceptional new neighbourhood.”Currently priced from £,, properties at The Grove will enjoy plenty of light and space and will be built to CALA’s exacting standards which are renowned for quality, attention to detail and high specication – offering residents the very best of contemporary living.Fraser added: “The Grove has been very carefully designed to ensure it complements the existing surroundings and we expect it to be a very popular destination for those seeking the perfect place to call home.”For more details visit www.cala or visit the sales reception at Inverurie Locos FC on Harlaw Rd, Inverurie, open daily from am to :pm.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Inverurie man George Rowe in his Royal Navy days\"  Local man revealed as guard of honourviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Winners at this years North East Scotland Food  Drink Awards.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish.

They also campaign to improve their lives and remember the fallen.Mark Bibbey, chief executive of Poppyscotland said: “Members of the Armed Forces are often based far away from home so an initiative like this which offers a signicant discount on travel must be applauded. This will also make Loganair’s extensive network more accessible to those who have served, and to Forces families too.It underlines Loganair’s commitment to supporting the Armed Forces community and is just the latest way in which they have demonstrated this. We thank them for their continue support.”To find out more about the Armed Forces Fare visit www.defencediscountservicecopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening. It’s a few minutes that could save your sight.’ https:www.diabetes.org.uk resources-s - diabetes_in_the_uk_.pdf https:www.diabetes.org.uk about_us news over--of-people-unaware-diabetes-can-lead-to-blindness- State of the Nation’s Eye Health, Specsavers  RNIB  https:www.rnib.org.uk knowledge-and-research-hub-research-reports prevention-sight-loss stateofthenation http:www.rnib.org.uk sites default files RNIB_evidence_based_review_of_working_age_people.pdf vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are hopeful however that the Scottish Government will pass on the additional money.\"Over the period   to   the Highland Council has already had to implement budget savings of pound. million and council tax rises of % in each of the last two years in order to deliver a balanced budget.

We do however have the risk of the cost of another harsh winter ahead of us.\"The council is now focusing on income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies to protect essential services.Cllr Mackinnon added: \"There will be very hard decisions to make as we plan for a reduced budget over the next three years and it is vital that we involve the public, our staff and all members in the choices we make.\"Depute budget leader councillor Matthew Reiss said: \"This is an opportunity to listen to what is important to people, to reshape our priorities and to focus our resources on improving lives.\"I strongly encourage everyone to get involved in this and make your voices heard.

We should have something similar around the Firth. You see people driving past Kirkmichael slowing down to take a look because it looks interesting. People are drawn in and genuinely interested by what they see.\"Irsquom not really all that comfortable with heritage being competitive but this does mean the community, which has been supporting this for close on  years, can be recognised. Five years ago we were at the point of giving up when the roof literally fell in. We had a meeting with the community and they urged us to push on.\"The Federation of Small Businessesrsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, David Richardson, hailed the Trust for \"working wonders\" on the kirk, graveyards and mediaeval stones.\"Visiting old graveyards is not just of interest to locals and those with ancestors buried in them it is also very popular with many visitors interested in soaking up more of the local atmosphere and history and in reading the stories written on the older the stones.\"Including interpretive  that explain more of the history and expand on these stories makes the whole experience even more powerful.\"Dr Mackayrsquos suggestion that a Highland graveyard heritage trail should be created is excellent surely an idea whose time has come  Itrsquos certainly well worth further exploration and discussion.\"Kate Forbes MSP, whose constituency takes in the Black Isle, said: \"I love what the Kirkmichael Trust has done to repair the graveyard and draw in locals and visitors.

We have a whole plan of engagement throughout the year that will do that, starting later this week.\"And at the same time to listen to the public and to hear the views of what the council is doing really well, what everyone believes the council could be doing better in terms of delivering services and the important part of that is that we go across the Highlands to hear those views.\"The first thing is about listening to people, the second most important thing is about going back and saying to people lsquoyou said and we willrsquo or lsquowe are not able to becausersquo.\"The councilis due tostart a \"public budget engagement process\" tomorrow, designed to help the local authority make decisions to balance its books.\"It is really important that we listen throughout the month of November,\" Mrs Manson said. \"Then we will go back and give feedback on what the suggestions are.\"Mrs Manson was upbeat about the local authorityrsquos financial woes that have seen it stumble from one unpopular cutback to another over several months amid a flurry of resignation threats from within the administration.\"I am quite positive about our budget situation here in the Highlands ndash I think we are in a fair place,\" she said. \"There are places where we will be able to make efficiencies and our officer team and our members are working on that all the time, day-in, day-out behind the scenes.\"However, Mrs Manson did accept that \"there are some challenging areas in there, such as what our priorities for resource and for spend are, and I think it is very important to take a transparent approach so that when we do take decisions in February [when the council budget is decided] we can actually evidence it comes after listening to people.\"One of the answers to those challenges, according to the chief executive, is to rely on the \"many talented staff who believe in the values of public service and that we are here to make a dference\" and to capitalise on an upsurge in community involvement.\"I genuinely believe that many, many people that I have been speaking to over the last few months in dferent parts of the Highlands have really good ideas,\" she said. \"They see where the council can become more efficient.\"But equally so, I think that people can be more understanding of the challenges that we face.\"The local authority has made pound. million of savings since  and raised council tax by three per cent in each of the last two years.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \"We have to do more with less money and our costs are rising for things like fuel, pay and cost of living.\"We are working with services to produce comprehensive information on our current spending profiles, to identy where there are opportunities for efficiencies and any commercial opportunities. Our focus will be on directing our resources to those areas which will give us the best outcomes and deliver value for money.\"Depute budget leader Matthew Reiss said: \"It will not be easy to find more savings on top of those we have already made. Income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies become even more vital in this context in order to protect essential services and we do not have the luxury of the signicant reserves we once had to give us any room for manoeuvre.\"It is undoubtedly the case that there will be very hard decisions to make and we will begin a process of engagement to help us make the right decisions and do the best we can.\"Sunday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In a bright apricot top and carefully made up, she’s surrounded by our favourite foodies as she presents another serving of The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice, the spin off from the ratings busting TV show. She couldn’t be more rehabilitated from the days of her vilication as the man-hating, acerbic lesbian stand-up she never actually was, to the favourite aunty now welcomed into the nation’s sitting rooms to serve up their feelgood comfort food TV. “I think I’m seen as a bit more fluffy now,” says the -year-old in her pleasantly dry laconic drawl. “A lot of the press thought when I got married, ‘oh she can’t be a man hating lesbian after all’”, she says, sounding asshe’s scuffing the toes of her Docs on the ground as she drags herself all the way to double home economics. As for the sartorial makeover, Brand is happy to ditch her matching black T-shirt and leggings for pastels on TV because “they make me. No, they don’t, but my thing is to fight bigger battles. I wouldn’t select colour for myself butsomeone  does, I’ll wear it. And they do your make-up too,” she says, sounding pleased, as she loves a bit of lippy, and an aubergine tint in her hair. Because despite the rebranding, Brand has retained her ability to subvert expectations, as well as her feminist or left-wing principles, along with her talent for devastating one-liners. She’s been making us laugh for  years, since Channel ’s late night comedy show Saturday Live in the late s, after she’d already made her name as the heckle-proof deadpan ‘Sea Monster’ on London’s comedy circuit. Her own shows Jo Brand’s Big Splash and Jo Brand Through The Cakehole followed and she became a regular list on Have I Got News For You, QI, Would I Lie To You and Countdown. Moving into writing, she penned and starred in NHS comedy Getting On, for which she won a Bafta to add to her four British Comedy Awards and most recently, social services satire Damned. Her several books include an autobiography and novels, one of which she adapted into this year’s film The More You Ignore Me, starring Sheridan Smith. And there’s her latest book, the amusingly useful le guide, Born Lippy: How to Do Female. All of which amounts to the sort of career that leads to you being called ‘national treasure’, so how does she feel about that  “It’s not my favourite thing because it limits your behaviour. I don’t hate it, it’s quite funny, but I would reserve judgement because I don’t want to behave like a national treasure for the rest of my le. I might want to do things that don’t fit into that category…”Such as… back in the Extra Slice studio it’s dessert week and Jo is revisiting the contestant’s chocolate spheres. The trick is to pour hot chocolate sauce over and watch it melt daintily, but an impatient Brand speeds things along with a tenderising mallet, inadvertently also smashing the white china plate underneath. “Sorry,” she says, unconvincingly, as the guests and studio audience cheer her on. This national treasure still has an irreverent bite.Brand loves presenting Bake Off: An Extra Slice despite admitting thatwe shouted ‘Show Us Your Bakes!’ at her, she’d come up with... “not much – a very plain sponge or a rhubarb crumble. The problem I have is making it look nice and Bake Off is as much about art as baking.” Did she take the hosting gig for the comic potential of soggy bottoms, cracks and buns then “To be honest, I did it because they asked me, and I love its happy audience, funny  and – unintentionally terrying sometimes – audience baking. And I liked the format. It’s a bit like Have I Got News For You, presenting, with a  of funny people and an audience.“I’m doing another HIGNFY soon, hosting this time, and it’s like promotion, being a grown up,” she says.The  show allowed Brand to demonstrate her more reasonable than raging approach to feminism when she calmly reprimanded a dismissive Ian Hislop and the all-male  for downplaying sexual harassment in the House of Commons, by saying, “For women,you’re constantly being harassed, that builds up and wears you down.”“I really like Ian a lot and have known him for years and I was really surprised, but I felt I had to say something. Because it’s a creeping thing, a collective set of experiences that wear you down. It’s not a one off touching your bum, or ‘you look gorgeous’, it builds up.” As the mother of teenage daughters, Maisie and Eliza, Brand is used to being uncool, but for once they were impressed. “They loved it because I was trending on Twitter for three months. And I’m pleased it got the attention it did. My instinct was to speak quietly because it’s such a cliché about feminists, that they’re just a load of shouty women with no sense of humour.” At which point it seems apposite to insert one of the jokes from Born Lippy: How many Feminists Does it Take to Change a Lightbulb Do it yourself, you lazy bastard.Things have changed for women in comedy too, for the better according to Brand as attitudes have moved on. “For a long time male comedy was described as being lots of dferent styles – Eddie Izzard did surreal, others did puns – and women were just ‘women doing comedy’, but these days women are allowed to have all kinds of dferent personalities and styles.” Away from the telly, Brand is back on stage and heading for Edinburgh, with Birmingham Repertory Theatre’s Nativity! The Musical. Thanks to Maisie and Eliza, she has been to her share of nativity plays and is a big fan of the Nativity! films. “What you do is totally focus on what your child is playing, eventhey’re a rock or sheep, and for my money, the more mistakes the better.“I’m playing a newspaper critic who starts off cynical and is swept away with the show because the kids are so great.” Being self-deprecating, Brand is downplaying her own starring role in a school nativity, when she played not ‘Bethlehem’, as she’s claimed, but Mary. “Well, I remember virtually nothing about it, apart from wearing a white head thing and a blue dress. It was the s and traditional – no space ships – they didn’t give Mary an awful lot to say. Mary doesn’t say a word in the Bible, it’s all Joseph. And she was very pregnant, wasn’t she, so she’d probably just have said ‘My God I’m tired.’”Born in South London in July  to an engineer and social worker, with an older and younger brother, Josephine Grace Brand grew up in Kent then moved schools at , hated it and started to skive, smoke and drink. In Born Lippy she doesn’t hold back describing her headstrong teen years with stories of the time her dad punched her heroin addict boyfriend, or when he threw all her clothes on a bonfire after he and her mother caught underage Brand coming out of Emmanuelle, stoned, accompanying seven men, the incident that prompted her leaving the family home. Moving in with her posh heroin addict boyfriend, she went on the pill and put on four stone, becoming the spiky haired, thick-skinned ‘Sea Monster’, an alternative comedian who faced down the hecklers with her deadpan drawl. Ask Brandshe regrets leaving home as a teenager, she demurs.“No… I would say I probably did the right thing actually because I don’t think things would have been any better at home and to some extent, my leaving added to the weight that made my father get some help. I needed to get out just because we were in one of those awful relationships where you can’t work it out and be calm.” While honing her comedy she trained as a psychiatric nurse and worked at an emergency department where knives, guns and abuse were a reality and made the clubs look tame. “When you’re a stand-up comedian and people are off their heads, you get a lot of abuse. But the manic phase of bipolar disorder is way more eloquent than the average drunk bellowing ‘f*** off you fat cow’”. Brand’s ten years working as a psychiatric nurse provided her with background for her sitcoms satirising le at the sharp end of the caring professions and she acknowledges that her father’s struggle with depression may have influenced her original choice of career.Set in a geriatric ward the BBC Four series Getting On, which she co-wrote and co-starred in three series of, was directed by Peter Capaldi and did for the NHS what The Thick Of It did for politics, as well as winning her a Bafta in  for Best TV Comedy Performance. Meanwhile Damned, the second series of which screened this year on Channel  is set in a social services office, and stars Brand, and her friends Alan Davies and co-writer Morwenna Banks.“They say write about what you know then you don’t have to spend a lot of time researching to make it relevant. That’s why I haven’t done any dramas about scaffolding. I stick to stuff I do know about, mental health, nursing, social work, and not many people are doing stuff about that. I have experienced a lot of le. My favourite comedy is the kind where you see that, where people have had proper jobs before they came into it. It adds something.” Mental illnessis also dealt with in The More You Ignore Me, a novel she turned into a film, set in s rural England. Starring Sheridan Smith as Gina, a schizophrenic mum who is hospitalised after becoming obsessed with a local weatherman, it also features Mark Addy, Sheila Hancock, Ricky Tomlinson and Brand herself.“The central thing is how unglamorous it is to be ill like that, and its impact on the family. In the s it was something that was kept private, shameful. My dad suffered depression from his teenage years and didn’t seek help until his mid-fties. It’s unrecognisable now in comparison, and the power of the person seeking help has risen exponentially. “A few of my friends who are psychiatric nurses saw it and they’re hard-bitten cynical people, so to make them cry and laugh too, I was satisfied. I couldn’t believe I had the power to move people with something I’d written.” Her latest book Born Lippy: How to Do Female is moving too, as well as funny, and most of all useful. A collection of all the things Brand wishes she’d known, things she’s learnt, and things she hopes for the future, among the chapters are, How to Manage a Bully, Your Family And How To Survive It, Having Fun, Not Having Fun, How Not to Fall in Love, Feminism, a Rebranding and Staying Sane.There’s also handy practical advice for you to try. Can’t get on with your toxic family  Lower your expectations. People making you unhappy  Ultimately, you can walk away. Nervous at parties  Try some ice-breakers: “What’s the most violent incident you’ve ever witnessed ” Or “What’s the worst lie you’ve ever told ” Find yourself confronted with a flasher  Shout “That looks like a penis only smaller,” and for women faced with that old favourite: “You obviously hate men,” try “No I don’t, it’s just you”, while “You need a good shag”, can be dispensed with “I’ll look where then.”Hitchhiking alone at night, falling in love with a heroin addict or smashing up an abusive driver’s windscreen when you have PMT  Read Brand’s own experience and it might put you off. Although she’s conflicted about that last one. “I’m not advocating violence,” she says, “butyou do suffer from PMT be aware you might go there one day. I used to control it  per cent of the time, and when I didn’t, I tried to appreciate it. And it was always towards things, never people, and that’s not quite so bad.“The book is all stuff that was familiar to me, that happened to me or was interesting to me. Hence the lack of a chapter on motor mechanics. I wrote it for my daughters in a way.“If you’re a comedian rule number one is ‘be funny’. There are serious bits but a lot of it is tongue in cheek. I don’t like to give advice and I think the best way is to tell people stories about what went wrong for you and say,you can avoid doing that you’ll be better off.” Brand is keen to write more novels – “so I don’t have to get dressed” – but hasn’t lost her love of stand-up. The problem is being away too much from the South London home she shares with husband of  years, Bernie Bourke, a psychiatric nurse, her daughters and cats Louis and Dotty. Script-writing and TV work suit her at the moment, but she’s never been one for five or ten year plans. “As things come up I think do I want to do it or not ” she says.And she decided she did want to do the Edinburgh and London legs of the Nativity! The Musical tour as she “likes Scotland”. Speaking of which, Brand was one of the  celebrities who signed an open letter in theto the people of Scotland urging them to stay in the UK in . Does she still think that, in the light of the Brexit vote “Well, I think so, just because I like Scotland,” she says. “But to be honest, I don’t blame you for wanting to leave because I wouldI was in Scotland. You have policies that are good on health, such as free care for the elderly, and it’s more caring. “As for Brexit, I would support another referendum because I think we are much better suited being in Europe than on our own, but it looks asaround half of the people are delighted by Brexit, and that’s quite a dficult thing to live with. “A bit of me thinks ‘you’ve made your bed, see what happens when you haven’t got enough people for the health service, doctors, teachers…’ Let’s see what happens.

Though Jo Johnson was careful not to take too many potshots at Boris, his resignation last week as a minister and demand for a second EU referendum could scarcely have been a more powerful indictment of the former Foreign Secretary#s reckless egotism or a clearer attempt to separate himself from his elder sibling.In this, he was successful: his explanation for his actions, set out in a y blog post, possessed an integrity Boris wouldn’t recogniseit ran up to him in the street yelling: “This is the way you behaveyou have an ounce of decency, you craven, self-entitled buffoon.” The gulf between the two was reinforced when another Johnson – their sister Rachel – tweeted: “Am hugely proud of my honourable and principled brother, Jo, who has put the interests of the country ahead of his political career.” The “as opposed to my unprincipled brother, Boris, who shafted the country, then legged it” addendum was tacit, but everyone understood it, nonetheless. Jo’s blog post is a clear-eyed,devastating analysis of the scale of the crisis facing the UK as a result of Brexit and of the failure of “statecraft” that brought us to this position. In it, the former transport minister says the “choice” being presented to the British people – between Theresa May’s fudgeand a “no deal” Brexit – is a choice between “vassalage and chaos”.Despite being a Remainer, Jo says he had hoped the government would make a success of Brexit, delivering the vision of a post-EU Britain voters were promised before the referendum. Now, however, he understands that the notion of a great nation freed from the shackles of Brussels was a mass delusion, and believes the country must be given another chance to vote on the reality.“To those who say that is an affront to democracy given the  result, I ask this: ‘Is it more democratic to rely on a three-year-old vote based on what an idealised Brexit might offer, or to have a vote based on what we know it does actually entail ” he wrote.Of course everything is relative. Before we get carried away by Jo Johnson’s clarity, let us remember that this is the man who lost his job as universities minister for appointing Toby Young – purveyor of misogynistic and homophobic tweets – to the board of a universities regulator.Equally, the younger Johnson may have seen the light, but his epiphany is somewhat belated. Though others have been measuring the depth of the abyss at the edge of which we are hovering ever since the Leave campaign was victorious, it has taken the approaching Commons voteto focus his mind.Nevertheless, set beside Boris, Jo is a model of decorum. He stuck by the Prime Minister while she tried to deliver a Brexit neither of them wanted. And – at the point when sticking by her was no longer compatible with his conscience – he exited with dignity, eschewing the opportunity to make her the scapegoat for other people’s failings.Compare his behaviour to that of his Big Bro, who hawked the country’s future for a shot at power, and, when it all went wrong, blamed everyone but himself. Boris is no keener on Theresa May’s plan than Jo, yet he would rather see the country plunged into darkness than offer the electorate the opportunity to record that they were sold a pup by a bunch of blaggers. It is dficult to believe they share the same gene pool.Jo shines because he is surrounded by intellectual pygmies: people like Dominic Raab, who makes David “no notes” Davis look competent. You might have thought Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley had hit peak idiocy when she admitted she hadn’t known people in the Six Counties vote along constitutional lines. But Raab apparently has problems grasping the concept that Britain is an island. Last week, he revealed that, until recently, he did not fully appreciate the importance of the Dover-Calais crossing for UK trade. This is odd. After all, in June – a month before he replaced Davis as Brexit Secretary – it emerged the civil service had drawn up a Doomsday scenario of the pandemonium that would unfold in the event of no-deal Brexit. It included the prediction that the port of Dover would collapse on day one, that supermarkets in Scotland and Cornwall would run out of food within a couple of days and that hospitals would run out of vital supplies within a month.But then you only have to watch footage of Raab failing to understand the basics at the first meeting of the Exiting The EU select committee back in  to get a sense of his cerebral limitations. Then, Raab declared himself “jarred and bemused” by the idea that Brexit might create more rather than less bureaucracy. Sir Simon Fraser, former director-general, Europe and Globalisation, can be seen explaining it all to him with admirableslightly strained patience. Like a teacher dealing with an academically challenged pupil, he finds concrete examples to make his points more digestible. Let’s look at what might happenwe were to leave the customs union, he says. One corollary of that might be that there would need to be new regulatory arrangements put in place and checks on goods crossing the border. This could potentially create a heavier bureaucratic burden. It’s no use, though despite his best efforts Raab remains “bemused”.With this inability to take in information, it’s no wonder we are where we are. The country is being led by politicians who struggle with the simplest political concepts. How could they ever have been relied upon to steer their way through the trickiest negotiations of our time Referenda used to be sneered at ordinary people could not be expected to understand the ins and outs of complicated decisions. That’s what politicians were for. We voted them in because we trusted them to act responsibly on our behalf. But that requires them to be insightful, hard-working and with the best interests of the country at heart. No-one in the current cabinet is of this calibre.On the th anniversary of the First World War Armistice, it seems fair to say: we may not be a nation of lions, but we are most assuredly being led by donkeys. And duplicitous donkeys at that.Jo Johnson is right. Those donkeys – including Boris – sold us: “a  prospectus, a fantasy set of promises that have been shown up for what they were.” There is only one way to deal with this con trick democratically and it is to give voters a second chance to have their say on the cold, hard truth.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4827362.1541792842!/image/image.jpg","title":"upkilting isn t a laughing matter jane bradley","story":"Kiltmaker Howie Nicholsby reveals to Jane Bradley that he#s had a number of unpleasant encounters over the years, after relunctantly agreeing to allow a French model to apparently peek under his kilt during a PR stunt for the Mango clothing retailer.Would you look under a man’s kilt without permission  While you, personally, may not, there are plenty who would. Indeed, it has long been a risk for kilt wearers that they can be subject to unsolicited peeking, questioning about what is worn underneath – or even groping.Yet, while campaigners have long fought, quite rightly, for “up-skirting” to be banned, it has somehow been perfectly acceptable – nay welcome, even – for a woman to feel free to do whatever she likes when a man is wearing a kilt.Earlier this week, I reported on a stooshie over an advert produced by clothing retailer Mango. In it, the model, Jeanne Dumas, apparently a Parisian ‘it girl’, embarks on a visit to Scotland wearing the brand’s garments. As well as a lot of scampering around in the Scottish countryside with a dog, she graces the streets of Edinburgh with her presence, only pausing on her whirlwind fashionista tour to peek cheekily up the kilt of a Scotsman, who happens to be standing handily on the street.Broadcast on social media, the ad sparked outrage among people who complained that this action was “not appropriate”.“Mango,” said one, “are you really condoning lting up stranger’s skirts ! It’s not acceptable, whether it’s a lady’s skirt or a guy’s kilt.”Another argued that it was akin to sexual harrassment. “So odd that in a world where we campaign against ‘upskirting’ andconsider having their skirt lted to be sexual harassment, that a woman looking up a man’s kilt is shown as playful and jokey,” she said.: English upskirting ban ‘will also apply to kilts’As I watched the ad, I realised I recognised the chap who was the victim of this violation. It was none other than legendary Edinburgh kiltmaker Howie Nicholsby, who has worn a kilt every day for the past  years.I tried to contact Howie, who I assumed would laugh off the incident with a tongue-in-cheek comment – after all, he had not looked too traumatised on the video and had presumably given his consent to appear in the ad – but when I finally managed to have a chat with him after he ed from holiday, I found that he did, indeed, feel quite strongly about the practice.In fact, it turned out, he had allowed Ms Dumas to lt his kilt, but under some duress. He told me that he had actually tried to explain to the film crew that he didn’t feel comfortable with her peeking under his kilt, but that the language barrier, combined with a lack of cultural understanding, meant he found it dficult to get across. And after a long day’s filming, Howie was too exhausted to argue.“It was a pleasure to work with the Mango film crew, but they were foreign and they just didn’t get what I was saying about this,” he explains. “I tried to tell them that I wasn’t comfortable with it, that it was the equivalent of up-skirting, but they didn’t understand. It had been a long day and in the end, I just went with it. With hindsight, perhaps I shouldn’t have.”Howie estimates he has experienced at least one incident a year over the past two decades of what I am going to refer to as “up-kilting” with which he has not been happy. “There have been a lot of experiences, often late night in a bar, some in Scotland and some where,” he says. “There have been drunk -year-old women who probably should have known better and on occasion, even some men.”: Leader comment: Scotland’s upskirting law is not fit for purposeOne particularly unpleasant incident occurred in Newcastle, where a group of four women pinned him against the wall in a bar while he was on a stag night as their friend forced her hand up his kilt.“I usually wear underpants, but on that occasion it was a stag do, so I was commando,” he remembers. “I’d used an old rugby trick of putting a fair bit of Vaseline down there to avoid chafing and when the woman grabbed me, she looked at me asI was the one who was disgusting beacuse she’d got a handful of Vaseline. It was asI’d assaulted her, when it was the other way around. I was standing there, thinking ‘Jesus Christ, how is this OK ’”Up-skirting was made a specic offence in Scotland in , which refers to operating equipment, such as a camera, under people’s clothing. A separate up-skirting bill is currently being passed south of the Border, which will, it has been claimed, specically protect kilt-wearers, as well as women in skirts.While groping of any kind is obviously unacceptable and could be classed as an offence under sexual assult laws, socially, a woman sticking her hand up a man’s kilt is often seen as a bit of a laugh. Unlike women in the same situation, men are expected to almost enjoy the experience, which Howie says is most definitely not the case.“Of course, some guys are quite happy when it’s an attractive woman, but it has to be seen as under the same laws which protect women,” says Howie. “It has to be regarded in the same way as up-skirting.”And he’s right. We can’t argue that men shouldn’t look up a woman’s skirt – which obviously they shouldn’t – while watching a major brand do exactly the same in reverse.

Rather than seeing the loss of swathes of supporters during the  independence referendum campaign as evidence it had to do more to connect with voters, the party that once dominated our national politics seemed to take that humiliation as a challenge. Think we can turn off punters, do you  You ain#t seen nothing yet.Last week members of the Scottish Parliament were invited to participate in a vote on support for a second EU referendum, a so-called “People’s Vote”, on the terms of whatever Brexit deal the prime minister is able to negotiate. A majority were in favour. This was unsurprising enough. After all, most MSPs – in line with the majority of Scots – supported the Remain campaign in the  referendum.By  to , MSPs asserted their support for giving the voters the right to accept or reject Brexit in whatever shape it ultimately takes.Keen-eyed followers of the machinations of the Scottish Parliament will have noticed that more than a quarter of Holyrood’s politicians decided not to take a position on this, the dominant political issue of our times. Take a bow, Scottish Labour which – having been asked to take a stand – decided to abstain.With the honourable exceptions of former leader Kezia Dugdale and Edinburgh Southern MSP Daniel Johnson, who both supported a Liberal Democrat call for a People’s Vote, the Labour group at the Scottish Parliament took the weasels’ way out and refused to commit to either position.While Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard struck another blow in favour of political irrelevance, members of the SNP, Greens and Lib Dems united against the Tories to win the day.The Holyrood vote was, we should remember, symbolic the Scottish Parliament has no authority to call a People’s Vote. But symbolism matters in politics. In the aftermath of the  independence referendum, Scottish Labour struggled to make sense of the political environment in which it found itself. Yes, it had been on the winning side of that particular constitutional argument, but victory came at a cost: many one-time Labour supporters who had voted Yes decided that the SNP better represented them. Labour’s uncertainty – its position on a potential second independence referendum seemed to be fluid, shting from downright hostility to equivocal support and back – benefited only the SNP and the Conservatives, whose leader, Ruth Davidson, swtly established herself as the champion of those Scotswho supported the maintenance of the United Kingdom.The temptation is to say that Scottish Labour has learned no lessons from that experience, that it should have swtly positioned itself with the majority of Scots who voted Remain. But while the party should, indeed, have stood with the  per cent who saw through the Leave campaign’s case, its failure to so do is not a sign of political naivety but of its new priorities.Under UK leader Jeremy Corbyn – a career-long Eurosceptic who insists he voted Remain – Labour is determined not to stand in the way of Brexit. The more gullible among Corbyn’s supporters may delude themselves that he offers the best chance of preventing, or at least ameliorating, the worst effects of departure from the European Union, but those people simply aren’t paying close enough attention to their leader’s action. Time and again he has refused to challenge Prime Minister Theresa May on her Brexit plans, instead maintaining the pathetically weak line that it’s time for another general election. Corbyn placed the ball in May’s court, knowing that she would stick a kne in it. Of course she’s not going to call an election, is she So, there it is. What passes for Labour policy on the single biggest issue facing the UK is an impotent demand for the prime minister to commit an act of political self-immolation. This is not the position of a party that takes at all seriously warnings that Brexit will harm the economy, costing jobs in areas which might never fully recover from the impact. On Friday, Tory transport minister Jo Johnson – younger brother of Boris – resigned from May’s government and announced his support for a People’s Vote. Johnson, a Remain voter in , issued a statement in which he said the Brexit deal currently being negotiated with the European Union would be “a terrible mistake”. Johnson argued that Britain was on the brink of its greatest crisis since the Second World War and pointed out – not unreasonably – that what was now on offer was nothing like what was promised by Brexiteers during the campaign of two years ago.This is where we are now: the old Etonian brother of Boris Johnson is a more formidable champion than the leader of the Labour Party for those, already struggling, who’ll be hit hardest by Brexit.Scottish Labour’s Richard Leonard is only the latest in a line of leaders to have faced the accusation from the SNP that his party is little more than a “branch office”, taking orders from the imperial capital.Often the nationalists’ “London Labour” jibe was rather unfair. Various Scottish Labour leaders established their own agendas, distinctive from the UK party’s.But in the case of Leonard’s Scottish Labour, the charge sticks.When Labour MSPs abstained during the vote on whether there should be a second EU referendum, they put loyalty to Corbyn before loyalty to the majority of their voters.Dugdale’s decision to vote in support of another referendum shows how dferent things would have been had she not been hounded out of office by Corbynistas. Scottish Labour would have found itself, for the first time in a long time, standing with the majority.It appears that Leonard’s Scottish Labour exists to assist Jeremy Corbyn in his project to reshape his party rather than to fight on behalf of the weakest in society.If this is not so, how  might we explain Scottish Labour’s shameful cowardice over Brexit ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking.

I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Sunday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside.

The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option for making change in the north. - Declan Kearney MLAThe publication of an open letter to An Taoiseach, LeoVaradkar from over one thousand signatories in the Irish News is a powerfulintervention supporting the rights of Irish citizens in the north of Ireland. December that Irish citizens in the north “would never again be left behind by anIrish government”.These Irish citizens have explicitly urged Leo Varadkar toadhere to his expressed commitment from last year, “and to redouble yourefforts, and the efforts of your government to ensure that our rights areprotected”.Their intervention comes at a time of deepening politicalcrisis, and increased uncertainty and instability caused by the continueddenial of citizens’ rights, and the fast approaching Brexit catastrophe.This initiative indicates the frustration and anger amongrepublicans and nationalists and other progressive minded people about thedenial of rights here, and which are taken for granted where throughoutthese islands.It is outrageous that the northern state remains a rightsback water where language, marriage equality, womens reproductive health andlegacy justice rights, as well as a Bill of Rights are blocked.Northern nationalists are absolutely incensed with thecontinued denial of democracy and democratic rights.They are not prepared to put up with their Irish identitybeing treated with disrespect and contempt.Some of the signatories who have backed this highlysignicant intervention were active supporters of, and participants in theoriginal Civil Rights Movement  years ago.But many more are the children and grandchildren of those whocampaigned and marched in support of modest civil rights reforms and who werebeaten and shot off the streets and roads in the north because the unioniststate refused to deliver equality and rights.These citizens reflect the ersity, depth, confidence andstrength of those who identy as Irish citizens in the north.They represent tens of thousands of others in the north, andfrom right across Ireland, who have invested in the promise and ambition of theIrish Peace Process and Good Friday Agreement . They are articulatingthe voice of a progressive silent majority.However, they also persony a fundamental realignment withinnationalist and progressive opinion, including some sections of civic unionism.A new dangerous tipping point has been created in thepolitical process due to the destructive bigotry of the DUP the combinedefforts of both the DUP and British Government to systematically undermine theGFA, and to impose Brexit and, as a result of their toxic pact.The GFA guaranteed the delivery of equality, rights, parityof esteem and mutual respect.The DUP and others in political unionism have consistentlyopposed it from .Twenty years after the signing of the GFA it has still to befully implemented despite its status as an internationally binding agreement whichhas been laid with the United Nations.As a consequence, both the British and Irish Governments haveobligations as co-guarantors to ensure its implementation.However, the British Tory government turned its back on theGFA since it took power in .Now the DUP, British government and the most extreme elementsin political unionism are engaged in a full frontal assault against theAgreement. Brexit is the antithesis of the GFA.Its imposition will deepen the rights deficit in the northand will further destabilise the political process.That reality goes to the very heart of the existing politicalcrisis in the North, and which blocks the political institutions from beingre-established.A wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Torygovernment. They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8695614.1541521803!/image/image.jpg","title":"irish language group funding snub claim rejected by dup","story":"A DUP councillor has rejected claims that unionists #snubbed# a request to fund an Irish language event.Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge submitted a request to Mid and East Antrim Council to fund an event as part of Seachtain na Gaeilge , which takes place each March.Sinn Fein councillor Patrice Hardy claimed unionist councillors had “refused to even countenance” the request, adding: “Seachtain na Gaeilge is a hugely positive, global event which this council should be supporting rather than snubbing. “The Irish language community aren’t seeking special treatment, they are only seeking equality.”Last year, Ms Hardy accused the council of being “anti-Irish to the core”, after a move to have the local authority participate in Irish Language Week was rejected following a vote by members. In a statement yesterday, she added: “Despite all the controversy over the previous refusal to fund Seachtain na Gaeilge or even to engage with the Irish language community to discuss this, it appears that some members of the council have learned nothing.”But DUP Councillor Gregg McKeen said Conradh na Gaelige had been treated “the same as any other group” who had made a funding request, by pointing them towards the council’s grants programme.He told the News Letter: “They will be assessed under the same criteria as everyone . It is not that they are being refused funding, but they need to go through the same process as everyone .

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

If illegally burnt it causes air pollution andsent to landfill it takes hundreds of years to break down,\" explained Barry Patience, Waste Management Officer for the Council.\"With over , farms in the Banbridge district, we have the th highest number of farms in Northern Ireland and therefore a greater amount of farm waste including silage wrap. Farmers who are often seen as custodians of the countryside will hopefully take full advantage of this silage wrap recycling service with a view to becoming even better protectors of the environment.\"Before bringing silage wrap to the local community recycling centre, farmers must first register for this service at the Councils main offices. On registering, they will receive information about the requirements that the silage wrap must meet before it can be recycled.Farmers who avail of this new recycling service must report to the community recycling centre attendant to confirm the number of warps and check that they meet the requirements for recycling. Farmers will be invoiced for this service at the end of every month. It costs p to dispose of each wrap. With limited space available at each centre for the collection of wraps, farmers are advised that it may not always be possible to deposit a large amount in one visit.\"  \"  Man hospitalised after

The desire to produce the right deal can be superseded by the perceived need to produce a deal.This is why all negotiations need measures to prevent this, a check mechanism and preferably multiple ones.With the current UK-EU negotiations, there are two identiable check mechanisms or lines of defence to concluding an unwise agreement - Cabinet and Parliament.Last week, I wrote to the Prime Minister outlining broad concerns about the direction of travel.This could be discerned from shts in public comments, private engagements and what was being briefed in London, Dublin and Brussels. I wrote in the hope of reassurance and with the desire that an acceptable deal for us all was within grasp. Instead, I received confirmation that we were right to be concerned.If what is outlined in the reply is the type of deal the Prime Minister intends to conclude, then the DUP could not support a deal which annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.Indeed, many others in Westminster and throughout the United Kingdom, true to their commitments to respect the referendum, the national interest and to the Union, have contacted me to voice their concern.Equally we cannot be assured that this current proposal will be the final deal. The European Union price for agreement appears to rise daily whether it be our fishing industry or an ever growing list of level playing field commitments.Last December when this backstop appeared we were deeply concerned. This is why we sought and got the paragraph  assurance of a democratic protection against a sea border.In March, the EU made clear its intention to ignore paragraph  and rewrite paragraph . We took no solace from our predictions being correct but we did take solace that it was universally rejected.Neither the passage of time nor the application of pressure has made it any more acceptable now.The new idea of a UK customs arrangement does not appear to be a genuinely UK-wide offer but a GB offer and an NI offer badged as one - Northern Ireland in THE EU customs territory and GB in A customs union.The real intent is not to solve any land border issues in Ireland but to handcuff the UK to the EU, with the EU holding the keys. The United Kingdom would be trapped.The focus on customs arrangements should never blind anyone to a sea border of regulations.We certainly did not forget it and why we raised it repeatedly and consistently.It was something the Prime Minister ruled out after Salzburg: \"…no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree.\"The limited and low level checks that exist at the moment in Belfast and Larne do not compare to what wo uld be the future arrangement.Key industries in Northern Ireland would be subject to rules and standards with no democratic input to them. Rules would be made in Brussels rather than Stormont or Westminster.The regulatory sea border with some caveats in the Prime Ministers letter is still a sea border.This is not haggling about checks but preventing Northern Ireland from being left in the EU with the Northern Ireland Assembly reduced to vassal status or the devolution settlement torn up.Our most important trade flows are to be hampered and regulated by the EU. Despite all of this a Northern Ireland specic backstop still remains.The Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson has rightly warned: \"…Northern Ireland would erge unconsciously from the United Kingdom against the expressed will of its people - it would also feed Scottish nationalist demands that a similar ergent arrangement be made for Scotland.\"The DUP does not stand alone against this proposal. We appreciate the support from MPs across the United Kingdom.We are ready to stand with those in Cabinet and in Parliament to work for a better deal. One which works for the whole United Kingdom. We want the referendum result to be respected and the entire United Kingdom to leave together with a sensible deal.Arlene Foster is leader of the DUP"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands back petition from grieving girlfriend for upgrade of lethal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The grieving Newry woman had planned to travel to England to live with the GAA player, where he was due to begin a teaching course.But tragedy struck when Karl was travelling home from GAA training on the section of carriageway between Banbridge and Dromore.\"We were together for three-and-a-half years and had planned to move over to London,\" Ciara told the Belfast .She said Karl usually didnt want to \"jinx\" himself by getting too excited about their plans.\"But even he was believing in himself and believing that it was what he deserved. He deserved his chance to be a PE teacher,\" she added.The latest victims on the road were an -year-old man and his -year-old stepdaughter last month.Six months on from the tragedy, Ciara said lack of meaningful communication between the Department for Infrastructure and Karls family prompted the petition.More than , people have signed it within the space of a few days.

It is intended to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and the EUs Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar have insisted it must be part of any UK withdrawal agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has countered the plan by suggesting that the entire UK could remain inside the customs union for a time limited period.However the EU have said that that any backstop could not be time limited, and must remain in place until Brexit issues regarding the future relationship between the UK and the EU are fully resolved.A backstop to the backstop would involve only Northern Ireland remaining tied to the EU in the event that a trade agreement could not be reached within the time limited period.The DUP claim the plan would effectively separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and create a border in the Irish Sea.DUP leader Arlene Foster says no unionist would be able to support British Prime Minister Theresa Mays Brexit plan | Read more: https:t.co VTkYxMKNFW pic DxwUhqueW— RTÉ NewsNovember , Mrs Foster said that the DUP would not be able to support the Prime Ministers plan in Parliament.Mrs May currently relies on the support of ten DUP MPs to get key legislation, including Brexit, through Parliament as part of their confidence and supply agreement.DUP leader Foster suggested that her partys position had support from senior Conservative Party figures saying that Mrs May had \"a job of work to do to get this through cabinet\".Mrs Foster said the plans would cause a \"democratic deficit\" giving the EU power over Northern Ireland, without Northern Ireland having a say and could lead to Northern Ireland \"erging away\" from the UK over the next decade.She told RTE that her party only had \"one red line\" and that they were determined to protect the union.The DUP leader suggested thatMrs May wanted to pursue the current proposals she could so without the support of the DUPs ten MPs."},{"url":null,"title":"facebook post by catholic man from northern ireland on why he chose to join the british army gets massive reaction","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s crucial now for Parliament to vote down this plan, because it is the biggest giveaway of sovereignty in modern times.”The view was echoed by Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Bridgen who told a meeting of the Bruges Group: “If we can’t chuck Chequers then it’s time to chuck the Prime Minister.”Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker and DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson wrote in The Sunday : “If the Government makes the historic mistake of prioritising placating the EU over establishing an independent and whole UK, then, regrettably, we must vote against the deal.”Brexiteers have insisted that the UK should not get involved with a potentially permanent backstop customs union agreement with the EU as the price of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic updates co down road closed after collision","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In doing so, we join with people across these islands and across the continent of Europe, and worldwide. An event of impossible human destruction is now commemorated collectively in a powerful symbol of our shared commitment to peace.On this island, it has not always been so. As Irish Parliamentary Party MP Stephen Gwynn said: \"When the time came to rejoice over the wars ending, was there anything more tragic than the position of men who had gone out by the thousands to confront the greatest military power ever known in history, who had fought the war, and won the war, and now looked at each other with doubtful eyes \"That doubtfulness foreshadowed later times when there was too much forgetfulness, neglect or ambivalence in too many quarters about the place of those men and women in the history of this island.However, in the last decades I believe we have seen this transformed. Approaching the centenaries of the last several years, it was by no means clear that we would navigate them in a way that paid proper respect to the part they had in shaping the history, traditions, identities and lived experience of all the people of this island. It was by no means inevitable that we would mark these moments in a way that brought us closer together and gave us a better understanding of one another.Now we can look back and remember together the quiet dignity and shared purpose that characterised the high ceremonies of state of the last number of years. We remember President McAleese and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth side by side and bowing their heads in respect in both the Garden of Remembrance and in Islandbridge. We remember President Michael D Higgins laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier in Westminster Abbey during his State visit. We remember the Taoiseach and Prince William together honouring the memories of the th Ulster and th Irish Division under the round tower of the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Messines,  decades after those men fought shoulder to shoulder.Those moments, and the many others like them, were powerful. They opened up new spaces for everyone and inspired us to move into them. Where forgetfulness had built up, they reminded us. Where there was a sense that there was some unseen line that we perhaps should not cross, they swept it away. They left us closer together than we had been.However, they did not do so in isolation and in fact they did not lead the way. They built on the imaginative and patient work of a generation of people - professional and amateur historians, community leaders, church leaders, journalists, campaigners, and others from all parts of this island - who had refused to accept the articial parcelling out of a shared history to dferent groups and traditions, but wanted us to remember the lives and loss of the sons of Ulster, Leinster, Connacht and Munster all. They built on the work of all those who were not only open to new ideas and stories, new partners and audiences, but sought them out.I have been glad and proud that the Reconciliation Fund in my own department has been able in a small way to support dozens of projects in that spirit in Northern Ireland and where.As always, such transformation and such achievements must be built onthey are to be preserved at all. For the island of Ireland, the decade of centenaries of events that shaped our modern history continues. We will again have to rise to the challenge of remembering those events in our shared history in a way that is authentic and honest and rigorous and respectful of others. We have to do it in a way that enhances our understanding of our history, and our understanding of each other.We have to do all this while finding our way through the political challenges of the moment. I am confident we will. What we have done together in the last few years has shown that we can.In the Summer of , Tom Kettle wrote to his family promising, \" I live I mean to spend the rest of my le working for perpetual peace\". Eleven days later he was cut down while leading his men of the th Royal Dublin Fusiliers in what was described as a \"tempest of fire\" in Ginchy in France.We owe it to him and all the youth of his generation to take up that promise.Simon Coveney TD, Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade"},{"url":null,"title":"200 acre site outskirts derry identified preferred location new

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees. For a modest fee, bulk waste can be collected outside peoplersquos homes.ldquoFor the le of me I do not understand why people are prepared to load up their vehicles and drive to secluded, rural areas to get rid of household waste. Why not just drive to one of the three household centres in our district Cllr Curran said local council officials were placing increasing emphasis on promoting the district as a major tourist destination and the last thing they wanted to see was roads littered with waste.He added: ldquoThe message must go out that illegal dumping is unacceptable and that the countryside and indeed town centres must be respected, not used as open air dumps by people who should know better.ldquoWe are fortunate to live in a stunningly beautul area which should not be blighted by the reprehensible actions of a mindless few. Our rural areas in particular must be respected, not used as open air dumping grounds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballycran have it all to do in final  ","story":"BALLYCRANrsquoS hurlers are hoping that history repeats itself at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Sunday when they take on Cushendall in the Ulster Club Hurling Championship final.Itrsquos  years since the McKenna Park side last lted the Four Seasons Cup. That was in Cushendall are the aristocrats of the competition and while Ballycran have lost all three final appearances since their historic win in , the Ruairi Ogs have been crowned undisputed Ulster champions on no less than five occasions.Ballycran booked their place in this yearrsquos showdown after a sizzling display of open hurling, blasted holders and hot favourites Slaughtneil out of the competition.Gary Savagersquos boys were rated as   outsiders against the defending champions, but they left Slaughtneil in tatters with an impressive display.Savage was part of the team that lted the trophy in  and in addition to now managing the side, his two sons, Liam and Phelim, help control matters on the field of play.Both boys are certainly chips off the old block and Phelim, despite still being a minor player this season, is showing his true pedigree by dominating games from the centre half back berth and midfield.He is surrounded by a host of top class hurlers with Michael Hughes Stephen Keith, Scott and Brett Nicholson, Conor Woods, James Coyle and Colm McManus to feed off.Ballycran lost both their Antrim League games against Cushendall by signicant margins, but championship finals are a dferent animal and Gary Savage will have his side in a voracious frame of mind for Sunday. Cushendall are expected to lt the Ulster crown for a record-breaking th time. They have an abundance of experienced players in Carl Carson, Sean Delargy, Neil McManus, Eoghan Campbell, Ryan McCambridge, Donal Naughton and Paddy McGill, but they know they are in for one heck of a scrap on Sunday.If Ballycran can come up with a plan for depriving Carson, McManus, Campbell, Naughton and McGill of the sliothar, then they are in with a shout, but that is easier said than done, given the experience in the Cushendall set-up.One thing that is certain is that Ballycran will give it their all, but some times that is just not enough.Meanwhile, Burrenrsquos bid to recapture their glory days in Ulster is over for another year following their - to - defeat to Scotstown in their provincial SFC quarter-final in Newry on Sunday.Burren trailed - to - at the break, but a stirring second half display saw them give the Monaghan kingpins a run for their money. However, it was Scotstown who had a sting in their tail and they held on for victory.It was a similar story for Bredagh in their Ulster Club IFC quarter-final in Cootehill on Saturday where they were beaten - to - by Cavan champions Mullahoran. Jody Gormleyrsquos charges were desperately unlucky not to progress and were pipped at the post by a goal in the last minute of added time.Elsewhere, Downpatrick beat An Riocht - to - in the ACFL Division  relegation play-off at St Patrickrsquos Park, Newcastle.The Hoops just about held on in dficult playing conditions as An Riocht refused to go go down without a fight.St Johnrsquos got the better of Ballymartin in their ACFL Division  relegation play-off and their - to - win was just reward for a determined display.The only negative thing for St Johnrsquos was the news that manager Benny Corrigan stood down after the game..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch bypass scheme edges closer  ","story":"THE planned Ballynahinch bypass scheme is moving into the contract stage, Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Cathy Mason has confirmed.The partyrsquos Slieve Croob spokesperson has received confirmation from the Department for Infrastructure that work has commenced on drawing up contract documentation for the scheme.She said: ldquoFollowing the decision by the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard to commence work on the Ballynahinch bypass in December , officials from DfI have been working diligently through the ious legal stages to ensure the long awaited bypass scheme can commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed earlier this year.Ms Mason added: ldquoThis has allowed the Department to now move ahead with preparation of the contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity  ","story":"A RECENT fundraising event in aid of Zambian businessman Charles Mwanda has raised pound,.The St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick was the venue in September for a night of musical entertainment organised by Sr Mary Delargy, a missionary sister from the town who has helped dozens of African children out of poverty and into professions over recent years.When Sr Mary worked in Zambia, Charles was her administrative assistant and she says the fundraising concert was not about giving him a hand out, but a hand up to continue with his business and employ a number of local people.The key reason for the September fundraiser was to generate enough money to allow Charles to purchase a generator so he could power his car wash business.Sr Mary worked in Zambia and during this period Charles was her assistant, helping her with the young people she was working with aged between  and .She had helped Charles get his business going through donations but there was a problemwith the power supply which is intermittent. To help keep the business going, he required a generator which is now in place.Sr Mary explained that due to regular power outages, electricity is only available from pm to am, therefore no business can operate during daylight hours.She said the recent concert at the St Patrick Centre raised pound, with an additional pound raised via subsequent donations.ldquoThe generator has been bought and installed and is making real dference to the business, a delighted Sr Mary confirmed this week.ldquoCharles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity of people he will never meet. He now employs five young men and sustains his own family with the proceeds of the business.Sr Mary has thanked everyone who made the recent concert such a success, in particular, the Director and staff at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and the talented Stephen Smyth and his band who provided the the entertainment.Thanks were also extended to Frenchrsquos for providing the delicious supper, Downe Travel, Connollyrsquos and the Knights of St Columbanus for sponsorship.St Mary added: ldquoThank you to all those who attended the .

Keenan quickly tagged on a rsquo with two Morgan frees stretching the lead to four points by the th minute.Ballymartin were far from playing the role of bystanders, but they managed to shoot seven wides against the wind, misses that proved crucial at the finish.With  minutes gone Chris McKay had a stinging shot crash off the crossbar following a stunning passage of play, but Keenan and Morgan ensured St Johnrsquos kept ticking over with points apiece.Ballymartin continued to waste several good scoring opportunities before Michael Higgins picked up his sidersquos first score in added time at the end of the first half as St Johnrsquos went in with a - to - lead.It took the protagonists a while to settle in after the break, but with  minutes gone Cathal Doyle reduced the arrears to four points with a score from play. St Johnrsquos then cruelly lost the services of the influential Eoin Moag to a black card and minutes later he was followed for an early bath by Darren Savage, who received a second yellow and then red.St Johnrsquos backs were now to the wall and Ballymartin made sure they stayed there. However, another Morgan free stretched St Johnrsquos lead to - to - before the real Ballymartin fightback started.Consecutive points from Michael Cunningham, Ryan OrsquoHareand Ross Cunningham left a single point in it and Ballymartin were in the right tack.The Lilywhites pushed and probed for the equalising score, but with the game in added time St Johnrsquos broke free and a surging run from Conor Flanagan ended with him setting up Branf for the match-winning score.Just to rub salt into the wounds, Morgan added a point from play to leave St Johnrsquos with their Division  status intact.St Johnrsquos: D Morgan, C Magorrian, A Morgan, J Addis, D Savage, R Flanagan, M Grant, A McMullan, E Moag, C Brannf , C Morgan , C McKay, M Keenan , J Clarke, C Flanagan.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

DUP Leader Arlene Foster has reiterated her party’s stance that they will not back a deal which results in a trading border down the Irish Sea, which would mean Northern Ireland being more closely aligned in terms of rules and regulations with the Republic of Ireland the EU than the rest of the UK. Speaking ahead of Monday’s meeting, Michelle O’Neill said: “This is the latest in a series of engagements and initiatives which the parties have taken together to demonstrate that the DUP and British government do not represent the cross-community majority of people in the North who voted against Brexit. This will be followed by a meeting with An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Wednesday.“The Brexit negotiations are now in a crucial phase and this is another crucial show of unity when we will once again be asserting our common position that the ‘backstop’ as already agreed must be maintained.“The backstop is the absolute bottom line for Sinn Féin, SDLP, Alliance and Green Party as we enter the endgame of the Brexit negotiation process on Britain’s Withdrawal Agreement with the EU.”The DUP leader meanwhile over recent days said “no unionist” could back Theresa May’s apparent advocacy of a withdrawal treaty that includes a Northern Ireland specic backstop measure to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.

Located on Pearse Street right beside Trinity College in the heart of Dublin city, it made the perfect location to for the tour, with quirky and fascinating décor and superbly stylish and comfy rooms to retreat to after a day’s exploration.After unpacking, we progressed to the veranda, mixing with guests from all over the island. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly and boded well for dinner in the Courtyard Restaurant, which included ham hock, blackberry sorbet, and a iety of cheeses and enjoyable wines.Of particular note was the delicious freshly baked bread, the creme brulee and the sirloin and the craic was good with a friendly and cosmopolitan mix of guests.After a very comfortable night, the breakfast was also top class, albeit, for once you are recommended not to try everything as one is typically tempted to, leaving room for the gourmet tour ahead.With the advent of cheap air travel in the s, however, came easy access to the cuisine of France and Italy and a real revolution began the strengths of top quality Irish ingredients then began to be married to the Latin flair and creativity,Our guide for the day was likeable foodie historian and former chef Chris Binchy. Starting in the heart of Trinity University campus, he gave a fascinating talk on the evolution of Irish cuisine. Our parents and their parents, he noted, would have enjoyed a pretty nutriotious but plain diet which ied little from week to week. Originally dominated by dairy produce, as Irish society was organised around cattle, the arrival of the French Normans in the th century brought a dferent type of agriculture and cultivation of crops.Dairy products, oats, fruit and root vegetables, cabbage, bacon, eggs and chicken were later added to with scones, tarts and pastries.With the advent of cheap air travel in the s, however, came easy access to the cuisine of France and Italy and a real revolution began the strengths of top quality Irish ingredients then began to be married to the Latin flair and creativity, giving what is today the st century foodie haunts across the city. Consequently, our first stop was a dedicated cheese shop, Sheridans, where we were entertained and informed by a true French man, who took care to extol the virtues of a wide range of new Irish cheeses made in the French style, all of which were passed around with crackers to sample.Next up was Powerscourt Shopping Centre, what was traditionally a wide open quadrangle in the centre of classic four storey Georgian buildings, but has been transformed into a charming indoor shopping complex, the central feature of which is the glass roof.A centre of all things ‘design’, we were treated to scones and cream from the Pepper Pot, which has a pedigree in custom baked breads and bagels, with a cult following among locals. They serve six dferent breads, all baked daily, which form the centre of all their dishes. Who knew Irish cream is dferent to English cream - clotted and not whipped with no sugar it is delicious enough without anything added, we were informed.

Specialising in natural cheeses, which were delicious, we also sampled a range of delicate parma-style hams, some of which were produced at Ballycastle and have a revered following in Dublin on account of the quality produce. For a change of pace we then popped into a traditional Victorian pub, the Swann, however this was a pub with a dference. It is ‘the’ rugby pub of Dublin, traditionally favoured by touring players the night before games - in the amateur era at least. It was run by legendary Ireland and Lions prop, Sean Lynch. Now run by his son Ronan, Sean still pulls the odd pint behind the bar and the rugby memorabilia on the walls is worth studying.This was followed by a trip to George’s street arcade, filled with ‘boho’ stalls and second hand bookshops, where we stopped at Lolly and Cooks for ‘Savage Rolls’ in Dublin the word ‘savage’ means ‘great’ and boy did these sausage rolls deserve the label. As big as your fist, they were as delicious as the meat loaf my mother used to make. Our last stop was the Temple Bar food market, which is even a hidden gem even to many Dubliners. As you enter, you may hear passionate yells from the acting school a few floors up, while a kaleidoscope of smells invade your senses.First up we tried the fresh oysters and the Temple Oyster Bar - surprisingly delicious. After that we moved onto the Market Kitchen, a food stall with a dference their menu on any morning depends on what all the speciality stalls around them are selling that day. We had sourdough with tahini and pumpkin puree, kale and chilli - out of this world! An interesting and worthwhile tour for visiting friends or family, stag and hen weekends or business trips. * Including overnight accommodation with breakfast and a Fab Food Trail, prices start from £ per room based on two people sharing.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He was a fantastic Minister to work with whilst we were at the DfE. Itrsquos a sad loss for Gvt, but Brexit is above party politics. https:t.co icoTQDFvmdash Justine GreeningNovember , Former Cabinet minister Justine Greening, who shares Mr Johnsonrsquos view that a fresh referendum is needed, called on Tories to oppose the PMrsquos Chequers proposals.She told The Observer: ldquoThe parliamentary deadlock has been clear for some time. Itrsquos crucial now for Parliament to vote down this plan, because it is the biggest giveaway of sovereignty in modern times.The view was echoed by Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Bridgen who told a meeting of the Bruges Group: ldquoIf we canrsquot chuck Chequers then itrsquos time to chuck the Prime Minister.Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker and DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson wrote in The Sunday : ldquoIf the Government makes the historic mistake of prioritising placating the EU over establishing an independent and whole UK, then, regrettably, we must vote against the deal.Brexiteers have insisted that the UK should not get involved with a potentially permanent backstop customs union agreement with the EU as the price of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: May faces struggle to keep Brexit plans on track amid Tory tensions article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni. try catch     .               ..

A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Riccc.jpg","title":"ni house prices outpace uk market","story":"Posted on Wednesday November  by John Mulgrew RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey Northern Ireland homes have avoided a UK-wide dip in prices, according to a new survey. The latest RICS and Ulster Bank Residential Market Survey shows a larger proportion of surveyors pointing to a rise in the average cost of a home. That was a higher level than anywhere  in the UK, during October. It says that “Northern Ireland surveyors are also the most optimistic, looking forward. A net balance of % expects prices to rise in the three months ahead, while a net balance of % expects the number of sales to increase in the same timeframe. Most other regions expect prices and sales activity to fall or be broadly flat in the final quarter”. In terms of supply, the survey pointed to a slight rise in properties coming onto the market in Northern Ireland for the first time in five months. RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey said: “Interest from first time buyers and a strong rental have been two of the factors driving the Northern Ireland housing market, with first time buyers and investors both very active this year. “Surveyors remain confident about the market, despite political and economic uncertainty, and  is shaping up to have been a more positive picture for the housing market than perhaps was initially anticipated.” Terry Robb, head of personal banking at Ulster Bank, said: “As the survey indicates, demand remains relatively strong and we continue to see a good-pipeline of mortgage applications. “Our new paperless mortgage process has generated interest but more fundamentally, interest in the market remains firm from a broad range of mortgage purchasers including first time buyers, home movers and those remortgaging.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
