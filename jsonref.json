It\u0027s just not quite sunk in.\u0027She said she was \u0027very proud\u0027 of her son\u0027s achievements, which include campaigning for deaf friendly cinema screenings, at such a young age.\u0027He is raising awareness of the difficulties and struggles that deaf children face, and he\u0027s doing it very well,\u0027 she said. The charitable entrepreneur          \u0027Miss Macaroon\u0027 Rosie Ginday, 34, (right) earned her invitation after Harry and Meghan were blown away by her Birmingham social enterprise and baking business on a visit to the city earlier this year.Set up in 2011, her sweet treats organisation reinvests profits into developing disadvantaged young people\u0027s potential, training them as chefs, and offering them real world experience.And the royal couple got the chance to sample some of her trainees\u0027 macaroons during their visit in March.The qualified pastry chef and former English teacher said: \u0027Harry and Meghan came to Millennium Point (Birmingham), and got to taste our macaroons which was really fun.\u0027They were both so passionate about meeting all the young girls there and took a real interest.\u0027They\u0027re accessible as well, and it\u0027s great to have a younger generation of royals showing they do care and they are invested in what young people can do.\u0027Ms Ginday\u0027s organisation has worked with care-leavers, the homeless, lone single parents and those with mental health problems, introducing them to working life, at the firm\u0027s shop and bakery, and even giving some the chance to work at Michelin star restaurant Purnell\u0027s.The inspiring primary school teacher          David Gregory (right) will be will be celebrating his first wedding anniversary on the same weekend as the royal wedding.Fortunately, though, the 28-year-old from Blyth, Northumberland, is taking wife Hannah to enjoy the festivities in the grounds of Windsor Castle on May 19.The pair married on May 20 last year and Mr Gregory described the invitation as the \u0027perfect\u0027 way to mark their own milestone.Mr Gregory, who teaches Year 4 at Newsham Primary School in Blyth, said : \u0027My mam wanted to go, the headteacher wanted to go, but the only thing that was ever going to happen was for me and my wife to head down.\u0027He will be wearing his own wedding suit for the occasion, but joked that his 26-year-old wife is stopping short of turning up in her wedding gown.\u0027We\u0027d always planned on celebrating our one-year anniversary as you\u0027d expect, but I don\u0027t think it could have been any more perfect,\u0027 he said.\u0027I\u0027m planning on going in very formal attire. I felt very comfortable and happy in my wedding suit so I think that\u0027s the right way to go.\u0027Obviously we thought about Hannah wearing her wedding dress as well but we\u0027re not going to try and steal any limelight.\u0027Mr Gregory, who was put forward for an invitation by the Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland, was singled out for his work strengthening and celebrating his local community in Blyth.His recycling initiative with pupils won a Love Northumberland award, and he is a driving force behind the Port of Blyth\u0027s STEM hub, designed to encourage pupils\u0027 engagement with STEM subjects, and inspire their future careers.The youngsters in his school have yet to find out about his invite because they are on holiday.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to tell them. We\u0027re looking at how we can make this really relevant and real to the children,\u0027 Mr Gregory said.He is, however, planning to record a video diary of his experience on the day for them.   The Welsh charity worker          Zoe Ardunell (above) will be lucky enough to see the couple for a second time, having met them during a recent visit to Cardiff Castle.The 20-year-old from Penygraig in Wales described that as \u0027a very happy day\u0027 and said Harry told her she was \u0027definitely a role model\u0027 for her work with the Valley Kids charity which helps disadvantaged children and families.She will take as her guest her 62-year-old grandmother Pat Churches, who she said \u0027loves the royals\u0027.Ms Arundell said she was relieved to see she had no plans that weekend, but quickly added: \u0027I think if I did have any plans they would be changed straight away!\u0027 Schoolgirl born with one leg          A schoolgirl born with one leg who became a charity ambassador and mental health champion is now looking forward to buying a new dress.Jorja Furze, 12, (right) says she will go shopping with her mother, Gabrielle, 39, who will also accompany her on the day, for something to wear for the event.Describing her delight at receiving an email invitation last week, the schoolgirl said: \u0027I was really excited and shocked because I didn\u0027t think I would get an invite.\u0027I had been told my name had been mentioned to some people about the wedding, but I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get close to it.\u0027The youngster, who was born with only a right leg, is an ambassador for the Steel Bones charity which supports civilian amputees, added: \u0027They thought I would be a good candidate.\u0027I\u0027ve grown up without a leg and they thought having someone that younger children could relate to would be good.\u0027Jorja, from the village of Isleham near Ely, Cambridgeshire, has also set up a quiet space at her high school where children with mental health issues can relax.She said: \u0027Me and my friend both suffer from anxiety and mental health, we decided we should do something because we knew a lot of people had similar problems and we convinced the teacher to let us start this up.\u0027 The community lunchers          Tessa Hince (right), who lives near Banbury, Oxfordshire, and Hayley Ash, of Shipston-on-Stour, both 32, have been running the successful Shipston Christmas Community Lunch, since 2016.The community event brings together people who might otherwise be isolated at Christmas, drawing its funds and produce from public donations.Both had already got invitations to the Queen\u0027s garden party on May 15, and joked they now needed to find different outfits for the wedding.Miss Hince, who is taking along her best friend, said she was \u0027absolutely speechless\u0027 and \u0027so excited\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s giving some coverage to this great cause,\u0027 she added.Miss Ash, who is taking her mother as a guest, said: \u0027It\u0027s crazy - it all feels like a bit of a whirlwind.\u0027 The amputee campaigner          Ex-Royal Irish Regiment soldier Phillip Gillespie (right) says it is \u0027a wee bit surreal\u0027 to think he will be there next month with his girlfriend, Kirsty Crawford.The 30-year-old, who lost his right leg in Afghanistan in 2011, is also eagerly awaiting news as to whether he has made the rowing and archery teams for the next Invictus Games - a brainchild of Harry.Mr Gillespie, who is involved with ABF The Soldiers\u0027 Charity, said he was looking forward to a busy few months with the Invictus trial results, the wedding and then a royal garden party following his BEM award last year.He said he had not told many people yet but expected his friends\u0027 reaction to be muted, compared to the feedback his girlfriend was getting.\u0027I think Kirsty has got more of a reaction, I think it (a wedding) is more of a girl thing,\u0027 he laughed.He added: \u0027It\u0027s a massive privilege, it will be a huge spectacle.\u0027                                                      Revealed: The full schedule and timings of Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding from their arrival at Windsor Castle to a glitzy evening bashRoyal fans across the country have been waiting with bated breath for the full details of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding day.And finally Kensington Palace have released the full schedule and timings for the big day.Here we look at what we can expect on May 19, from when the first guests arrive at Windsor Castle to the evening celebrations at Frogmore House.The couple will spend, as according to tradition, the night before their wedding apart.There will be no American-style maid of honour and all of the couple\u0027s page boys and bridesmaids – who are expected to include Prince George and Princess Charlotte – will be children.The couple will not go on honeymoon straight away – and will, remarkably, undertake their first public engagement as man and wife just days after the ceremony.

She had been drugged and kept in a small compartment under the bed.Donovan was also found guilty of kidnap and served half of his eight-year sentence.Matthews, who was relocated to a town in the south of England for her own safety following her release, also denied recent reports she had been selling sandwiches to homeless people that had been handed out for free by Pret a Manger shops. \u0027I never sold them, I gave them to the homeless,\u0027 she claimed.\u0027It was getting dark earlier and I used to go to help pick them up and take them to the homeless around the station.\u0027Sometimes I\u0027d take them to the Salvation Army.

The manoevre caused the infant\u0027s legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mother\u0027s womb.Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant\u0027s head. It was \u0027re-attached\u0027 to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye.It is claimed the mother was not even in established labour at the time.At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, the mother - known only as Patient A - came to face with Laxman and in a harrowing exchange across the room looked at her and said: \u0027I don\u0027t forgive you - I don\u0027t forgive you\u0027 as the doctor stared down at the floor. The patient then looked away as Laxman\u0027s QC apologised on her behalf.The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, and was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated.In heart breaking evidence Patient A, who was holding two teddy bears in her arms, told the hearing it was the first time she was due to give birth and added: \u0027I had been for a scan the previous Friday and I was told my son was breech and the nurse told me if anything had happened to my son it was going to be a c-section.Patients calling 999 will be told to show handlers a live...\u0027I won’t die for the NHS\u0027: Left-wing GP dubbed \u0027Red Robbo in...Women should convince doctors to give them HRT from age 45...Prosecutions of children possessing cannabis plummet as...Share this article\u0027But when I was taken to the labour suite nobody told me what was happening. A lot of people were talking they kept saying the baby needed to come out but nobody looked at me in the eye and told me what was going to happen.\u0027There were two doctors between my legs, one on my right hand side holding my hand and there were other people there too. I was examined by a doctor but she didn\u0027t say anything to me. They were checking for the baby\u0027s heartbeat and it had plummeted and that\u0027s when I was told it was going to come out.\u0027I remember them saying I was 2-3cm dilated and I was told to push. Nobody said I was not having a c-section and doing something else instead. Whilst this was going on I was in pain.\u0027The only pain relief I was given was a spray on my tongue. I was told it was meant to loosen my cervix but I was not given gas and air - I was in pain. I had the doctors putting their hands inside me and I had them pushing on my stomach and then pulling me down.\u0027I tried to get off the bed but they pulled me back three times and just said they had to get the baby out. They twice tried to cut my cervix and nobody told me they were going to do it. There was no anaesthetic. I said to them \u0027it doesn\u0027t feel right, stop it, what\u0027s going on, I don\u0027t want to do it\u0027 but nobody responded to me in any way.                            I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared                         - Patient A\u0027s statement to the tribunal \u0027Afterwards I was in a cubicle with a curtain around me and the sister came over to me and told me my son had passed away. I didn\u0027t know the details but Dr Laxman came to see me and the baby\u0027s father was there. Dr Laxman sat on the side of my bed and she said how sorry she was for what happened but I didn\u0027t know the full extent of what happened at that point.\u0027I just said \u0027it\u0027s alright, these things happen, I forgive you.\u0027 She went away but I started screaming when I found out the full extent - I was just crying. I was upset because of the severity of his injury.\u0027I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.\u0027Midwife Mona Chard said: \u0027I was aware she had palpable tightening and some bleeding and she was moved to the labour suite. There was a lot of discussion but I\u0027m not sure who was talking to who. I can\u0027t remember Dr Laxman having a conversation with a patient. I was trying to reassure the patient and comfort her. I remember looking round and people were shocked.\u0027The doctor came over to me and said Dr Laxman had decided there wasn\u0027t going to be a C section and I saw her pull the baby\u0027s feet and cord and she told the patient to push. That is something you cannot forget and Patient A was very distressed.\u0027The hearing was told the woman was given cocodamol before she was examined and Dr Laxman decided on a natural delivery. Lawyer for the General Medical Council Charles Garside QC said: \u0027They tried to coerce the birth through traction as the baby was coming feet first followed by the lower abdomen, upper abdomen and head.\u0027However, there was an obstruction during the birth which proved to be fatal. Dr Laxman allegedly delivered the legs, torso and arms successfully but whilst trying to deliver the head, it got stuck in the cervix.\u0027The attempt to manipulate the baby\u0027s head to come out of the cervix failed because the cervix has clamped onto the baby\u0027s head and despite effort made to assist, these efforts failed. Dr Laxman made three attempts to cut the cervix with scissors but Baby B\u0027s head was separated from his body and his head was stuck inside Patient A\u0027s body.\u0027The doctors had to arrange for the head to be removed. A Caesarean was then carried out - not by Dr Laxman who had become overcome by events - but by Dr C and Dr D, and his head was removed in that way.          The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee (pictured) with a team of other doctors\u0027As a matter of compassion the head was reattached so the appearance of the baby was not too extreme. The baby was shown to his mother so she had the consolation of seeing him.\u0027Mr Garside added: \u0027At no stage was Patient A given any pain relief or instructed on when the c-section was being carried out. At no point did she try to comfort or consolidate or explain to Patient A what was going on.\u0027She failed to perform a Caesarean without general anaesthetic at a time when speed was needed. They should have carried out a category 1 Caesarean section. \u0027The baby had a heartbeat, it was slow, but it was not dead. The choice was taken by Dr Laxman to try a vaginal delivery and this was the wrong choice. They should never use a vaginal delivery in that situation.\u0027New babies are fragile, but this tiny baby was more fragile, and being pulled or twisted could do a lot more damage.\u0027Laxman, who faces being struck off, denies contributing to the death of the baby. Her lawyer Gerard Boyle QC addressed the mother during the hearing and told her: \u0027Dr Laxman has asked me to say she is so very sorry and deeply saddened for the outcome of your baby.\u0027She knows that no amount of words can or will soften your pain but she is hoping that knowing that what she was trying to do was her very best to deliver your baby quickly and sufficiently and she had best intentions at heart. \u0027She did not intend to harm you or harm your baby and she offers her apologies in every possible way. She hopes at some point in time that will make you feel in a way, slightly better.\u0027The hearing continues.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/08/4C02D62600000578-0-image-m-5_1525937446297.jpg","title":"EU demands UK treats Northern Ireland like HONG KONG stay customs union","story":"    Brussels is urging Britain to treat Northern Ireland like Hong Kong and accept the province must accept EU rules and regulations after Brexit.

They blindfolded and trussed me.I have no idea how long I was in the Thai secret prison because no one would let me sleep. \u0027The masked abductors were waiting. I was terrified. They chained me to the hooks. Because I was midway through my pregnancy, I could barely move or sit.\u0027Some of what they did to me in that prison was so awful I can’t talk about it. They hit me in the abdomen just where the baby was. To move me, they bound me to a stretcher from head to toe, like a mummy. I was sure I would shortly be killed\u0027.                                                     The couple had moved from country to country hiding from Gaddafi\u0027s \u0027killers\u0027 because her husband was an outspoken critic of the regime and branded a terrorist by the dictator.Britain told the US they were in Malaysia travelling on French passports under assumed names.When they landed in Thailand the CIA were ready to grab them in Bangkok\u0027s airport. His wife  was jailed but released just before she gave birth to him in prison in 2004 and she said the £500,000 and the apology proves \u0027their torture was not and could never be justified\u0027.International human rights group Reprieve and the Belhaj family say their abduction was a direct result of a joint MI6-CIA operation following the \u0027deal in the desert\u0027 in which Tony Blair\u0027s government re-opened diplomatic links with Gaddafi.Former foreign secretary Jack Straw and ex-MI6 chief Sir Mark Allen also face questions about their handling of the affair.Attorney General Jeremy Wright said the agreement meant the Government did not have to admit any legal liability for what happened to Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar in 2004.But Prime Minister Theresa May has personally written to them both to apologise for their \u0027appalling\u0027 treatment, Mr Wright announced in the Commons.He said Ms Boudchar was being given £500,000 despite the Government not admitting liability. He said Mr Belhaj had never asked for money and will not receive any.In statements issued by their lawyers, Mr Belhaj and Ms Boudchar said they accepted the apology from Mrs May and the Government.Mr Wright told MPs it was important for the security services to learn from \u0027where we got things wrong\u0027, but said they were not admitting liability in a carefully worded statement.Mr Wright said the UK Government \u0027believes\u0027 the accounts and admitted Britain had \u0027contributed\u0027 to the appalling treatment they received.He said: \u0027We are profoundly sorry for the ordeal you suffered and our role in it.\u0027           The rendition came days before Tony Blair\u0027s \u0027deal in the desert\u0027 with  Muammar Gaddafi outside Tripoli in 2014 (pictured)  Attorney General Jeremy Wright said the agreement meant the Government did not have to admit any legal liability for what happened Hakim Belhaj and his wife while Theresa May also apologised (both pictured today)The Attorney General said he hoped the acknowledgement of what happened and the apology would ease the suffering Mr Belhaj and his wife. Mr Belhaj - a long-time opponent of Gaddafi - and his then-pregnant Moroccan wife claim they were kidnapped and tortured under the dictator\u0027s regime, when Jack Straw was the UK foreign secretary.           Abdel Hakim Belhaj, was the former leader of an Islamic militant group that sent fighters to Iraq and Afghanistan, who would later help overthrow GaddafiFollowing Mr Wright\u0027s statement, Mr Belhaj said via his lawyers: \u0027I welcome and accept the Prime Minister\u0027s apology, and I extend to her and the Attorney General my thanks and sincere goodwill.\u0027Ms Boudchar, who was in Parliament with her son to hear Mr Wright\u0027s statement, said: \u0027I thank the British Government for its apology and for inviting me and my son to the UK to hear it. I accept the Government\u0027s apology.\u0027Sapna Malik, from law firm Leigh Day, who represented Mr Belhaj and Ms Bouchar, said: \u0027Today\u0027s historic occasion is a tribute to the resilience of our clients in their quest for justice.\u0027After six long years of litigation, HM Government has rightly acknowledged that, even in the fields of counter-terrorism and international relations, there are lines which must not be crossed and which were crossed here, with devastating consequences for my clients.\u0027Today\u0027s candid apology from the Government helps restore the humanity and dignity so brutally denied to my clients during their ordeal and is warmly welcomed.\u0027 Mr Belhadj spent six years behind bars but is now a politician in Libya.The government had gone to the Supreme Court to stop Mr Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar suing over claims UK officials \u0027assisted and arranged\u0027 their unlawful rendition in 2004.  Jack Straw (left) could have faced legal action by Libyan dissident Abdel Hakim Belhaj (right) who claims the UK was complicit in his and his wife\u0027s abduction and rendition to Tripoli          Mr Belhaj - a leading member of the Islamist opposition to Colonel Gaddafi - and his wife have offered to settle for a token £1 from each defendant and an apology for what they sufferedThe couple claim the UK was involved in \u0027arranging, assisting and encouraging their unlawful rendition\u0027.According to Reprieve, part of the deal involved the illegal kidnapping and flying of Libyan dissidents to Tripoli.They say cases came to light in 2011, when faxes written by Sir Mark, which described the rendition flights, were found in Libya\u0027s intelligence headquarters. Giving his judgment at the Supreme Court, Lord Mance said: \u0027They allege that they suffered mistreatment amounting to torture at the hands of US agents in Bangkok and in the airplane and at the hands of Libyan officials in Libya.\u0027The judge said the couple were relying on the letter supposedly written by Sir Mark to Mr Moussa Koussa, head of the Libyan External Security Organisation.\u0027The letter congratulated Mr Moussa Koussa \u0027on the safe arrival of (Mr Belhaj)\u0027,\u0027 said the judge.\u0027It said that \u0027This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years\u0027.\u0027It indicated that British intelligence had led to Mr Belhaj\u0027s transfer to Libya, although the British services \u0027did not pay for the air cargo\u0027.\u0027 Government lawyers had argued that the Belhaj claims should be barred under state immunity.          Belhaj was allegedly transported to Libya and was tortured by forces of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi They said the foreign \u0027act of state\u0027 doctrine prohibits the courts of one country sitting in judgment on the acts of the government of another within its own territory.The High Court agreed with the Government\u0027s stance and ruled that the claims should be struck out.But Reprieve argued that the Government had already settled a related claim out of court by paying compensation to another family who were rendered to Libya in the same \u0027deal in the desert\u0027 conspiracy.The Court of Appeal then reversed the High Court ruling.It said the doctrine relied upon by the government might not apply to alleged breaches of international law or human rights obligations, even in cases involving the conduct of a foreign state.The appeal judges said there was a \u0027compelling public interest\u0027 in allegations of unlawful rendition and \u0027particularly grave violations of international law and human rights\u0027 being investigated by the English courts.UK Government lawyers then argued that the compensation claim could not be heard in a British court because it would damage relations with the US.But the argument was dismissed by the seven justices - court president Lord Neuberger, sitting with Lady Hale and Lords Mance, Clarke, Wilson, Sumption and Hughes. Lord Mance said that \u0027state immunity is no bar to the claims\u0027, and the defendants had not \u0027on the assumed facts shown any entitlement to rely on the doctrine of foreign act of state\u0027.He said: \u0027The appeals are dismissed and the cases may proceed to trial.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/01/4BE619A500000578-0-image-a-5_1525567893464.jpg","title":"Malaysian leader worlds oldest prime minister age 92","story":"    Malaysia\u0027s former leader Mahathir Mohamad (pictured) is set to become the world\u0027s oldest prime minister as he enters office at the age of 92Sri Lankan immigrants who paid up to $6000 for tickets are...Danish tourist becomes the first person to be punished under...Share this articleThe election result is a political earthquake for the Muslim-majority country, ending the National Front\u0027s unbroken 60-year rule.The vote sweeps aside Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose reputation has been tarnished by corruption scandals, a crackdown on dissent and the imposition of an unpopular sales tax that hurt many of his coalition\u0027s poor rural supporters.News of Mahathir\u0027s win sparked euphoria across Malaysia.Many analysts had thought the National Front might lose the popular vote but cling to a majority in parliament due to an electoral system that gave more power to its rural Malay supporters.News of Mahathir\u0027s win - previously thought to be an impossibility - sparked euphoria across Malaysia.    Outgoing Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak (pictured) of the Barisan National party coalition leaves after addressing the media at the party headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. In a speech he said he would  respect the \u0027verdict of the people\u0027          Najib Razak arrives at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur after losing the election to Mahathir\u0027We are so happy, such a proud day for Malaysia,\u0027 David Thaiga, 57, told The Guardian as he celebrated in the street.\u0027We have been waiting for this for the past 60 years. This is a miracle for us. And even though I was not a fan of Mahathir, I think he was the only one who could have brought this victory.\u0027Sukumira Sekhar lived through Malaysian independence and the following 60 years of rule by the Barisan Nasional (National Front) coalition.The 84-year-old said: \u0027I\u0027m so happy I survived to see this. I wish I could jump up and down for joy, but be sure my heart is jumping up and down. I\u0027m so proud of the people of Malaysia, especially the young people and the Malays who swung it.\u0027The result is a rare exception to backsliding on democratic values in Southeast Asia - a region of more than 600 million people where governments of countries including Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines have swung toward harsh authoritarian rule.In a lively news conference peppered with his trademark wisecracks, Mahathir flagged significant changes for Malaysia, which he described as being left in a \u0027mess\u0027 by defeated Prime Minister Najib Razak and the National Front coalition.He criticized a \u0027fake news\u0027 law pushed through parliament by the National Front during the lead-up to the election.Mahathir is being investigated under that law for claiming a plane he was to travel on was sabotaged during the campaign.\u0027We need to have this government today without delay,\u0027 Mahathir said. \u0027There is a lot of work to be done. You know the mess the country is in and we need to attend to this mess as soon as possible and that means today. So we expect that today, well, I\u0027ll be sworn in as prime minister.\u0027Supporters of the incoming government took to the streets of Kuala Lumpur to celebrate their unexpected victory.People stood on roadsides waving the white, blue and red flag of the opposition alliance that triumphed in Wednesday\u0027s election.

Malaysia reborn!\u0027But Ibrahim Suffian, co-founder of the Merdeka Center for Opinion Research, said the new government will have to contend with \u0027enormous forces of inertia and resistance from within the government elites.\u0027\u0027The bureaucracy and the rest of the government apparatus has never been used to this idea, having been, you know, more than 60 years under the same political party,\u0027 he said.Mahathir, prime minister for 22 years until stepping down in 2003, was credited with modernizing Malaysia but was also known as a heavy-handed leader who imprisoned opponents and subjugated the courts.Angered by the graft scandal at state investment fund 1MDB, Mahathir emerged from political retirement and joined the opposition in an attempt to oust Najib, his former protege.The US Justice Department says £3.3billion was looted from 1MBD by associates of Najib between 2009 and 2014, including £517million that landed in Najib\u0027s bank account and a £17million pink diamond necklace bought for Najib\u0027s wife.He has denied wrongdoing.Mahathir said the new government will not conduct a witch hunt, but Najib will have to face the consequences if he has broken the law.Bridget Welsh, a Southeast Asia expert at John Cabot University in Rome, said it was hugely ironic that Mahathir, who damaged Malaysia\u0027s democratic institutions with his strong-arm rule, has returned as its political savior.\u0027It is not just a comeback,\u0027 she said.\u0027It is about making amends about his mistakes and moving Malaysia forward.\u0027Mahathir said the new government would seek the release and full pardon of Anwar Ibrahim, an opposition icon imprisoned on sodomy charges that Anwar and his supporters said were fabricated by the National Front to crush the opposition.Anwar, whose sentence ends on June 8, should be free to participate in politics, he said. Anwar, a former deputy prime minister in the ruling party, was also imprisoned under Mahathir following a power struggle.On the economic front, Mahathir vowed to cancel a goods and service tax imposed since 2015 and said the government could also renegotiate the terms of Chinese loans for infrastructure projects.Mahathir disputed Najib\u0027s assertion during a concession speech that Malaysia\u0027s king must appoint the new prime minister because no single party has a parliamentary majority, calling it \u0027confusion.\u0027 The constitution, he said, only specifies that the prime minister must represent those with a majority in the legislature. Opposition parties won more than 135 seats in the 222-seat parliament.In his speech, Najib, 64, said he accepted the \u0027verdict of the people.\u0027The National Front \u0027will honor the principle of democracy in the parliament,\u0027 he said. Malaysia\u0027s former leader set to become world\u0027s oldest PM at 92 | World news | The Guardian"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/13/4C038DA700000578-5713665-image-a-3_1525956128533.jpg","title":"Labour big beast condemns Corbyns crazy populism","story":"    Alan Johnson (file picture) said the party was in the \u0027worst position\u0027 since the 1980s and predicted that the hard-Left takeover would \u0027end in tears\u0027          Mr Corbyn warned that the leadership of Mr Corbyn (pictured at PMQs yesterday) would \u0027end in tears\u0027\u0027We are in a worse position than we were in the early 80s, when Militant tried to take over the party,\u0027 he said.\u0027Ever since we were formed in 1900 by 27 trade unionists in London, ever since then people to our left and people who believed in revolutionary socialism, which the Labour party never has - we believe in democratic socialism - have tried to come into the party.\u0027That\u0027s not saying that everyone who\u0027s come in since Jeremy (Corbyn) won is a revolutionary socialist.

It\u0027s a crazy piece of populism.\u0027The comments came as Mr Corbyn faced a major backlash after boasting about his close ties to a far-Left party in Germany that wants to disband NATO and backed Russia over the annexation of Crimea.Labour MPs and activists voiced outrage after the leader tweeted a picture of himself meeting the chief of Die Linke, Katja Kipping.They pointed out that Die Linke was the new incarnation of the communist party that enforced the brutal Stasi regime in East Germany.Senior figures have previously demanded the abolition of NATO in favour of a security alliance with Moscow, and insisted that Crimea should be recognised as part of Russia.Die Linke is also in direct competition with the SPD - which is UK Labour\u0027s sister party in Germany.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/15/4C0D493200000578-5714023-image-a-49_1525963060518.jpg","title":"RAF Army Air Corps prepare Royal Wedding Suffolk bases","story":"    Military personnel were seen flying helicopters, practising marches and sword drills at the Army Air Corp\u0027s Wattisham Airfield (3 Regiment Army Air Corps pictured) and RAF Honington today ahead of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding           Flight Lieutenant Jess Donnelly practices her sword drill for the Royal wedding guard of honour at RAF Honington today   An Apache helicopter is pictured landing at Wattisham Airfield in Suffolk today as it practises for its Royal Wedding duties \u0027I had to scrape her jaw off the floor\u0027: Harry\u0027s Army pal...Will Prince Harry shave off his beard in time for the big...EXCLUSIVE: Meghan Markle\u0027s father begins his journey to...Share this articleMother dies and daughter injured after funfair ride failsPSOs arrest screaming 16-year-old boy at train stationRussia celebrates Victory Day with military parade in VolgogradHorrific moment man is electrocuted above music stageParamedics come to the aid of Brixton \u0027acid attack victim\u0027Huge wolf spider carries hundreds of babies on her backThomas Markle stops at 7-Eleven en route to the royal weddingWoman claims people should ask babies for consent to change nappyPeggy Mitchell dies in Barbara Windsor\u0027s final scene on EastEndersYoung Barbara Windsor appears in Carry On classicsSome of Barbara Windsor\u0027s best moments as Peggy MitchellHe flew inside the same Apache helicopters spotted at the Suffolk airfield today when he served in Helmand in late 2012.Over 250 members of the Armed Forces will be on various ceremonial duties on the day, with certain regiments with a special relationship to Prince Harry providing support on Kensington Palace\u0027s request.Twenty-three soldiers, one sergeant and one officer from Harry\u0027s former Army Air Corps regiment will line the street outside the chapel where the royal couple will say their vows. During his Army days, Harry was known as Captain Wales, part of the 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where he worked as an Apache helicopter pilot.       Prince Harry flew the same Apache helicopters pictured at the Suffolk airfield today when he served in Helmand in 2012          3 Regiment Army Air Corps is pictured led by Lieutenant Colonel N English as they practise marching at Wattisham Airfield in Suffolk today           Lieutenant Colonel N English leads his regiment in preparation for the Royal wedding in Windsor next Saturday           3 Regiment Army Air Corps practise marching for when they line the streets outside Windsor Castle next Saturday           Twenty-three soldiers, one sergeant and one officer from Harry\u0027s former Army Air Corps regiment (pictured at Wattisham Airfield in Suffolk today) will line the street outside the chapel where the royal couple will say their vows          Over 250 members of the armed forces will be on duty on Royal wedding day including the Army Air Corps (pictured today)          Members of Prince Harry\u0027s former Army Air Corps regiment are seen practising for his wedding day at Wattisham in Suffolk           An Apache helicopter is pictured on display at Wattisham Airfield in Suffolk today practising for the Royal wedding on May 19Captain William Calder, who will be half company commander on the day and lead his soldiers in a royal salute, said he had some nerves ahead of the wedding. He said: \u0027We will march through Windsor into the castle in time for the end of the wedding and as the couple and the royal family depart, we will be pride of place presenting them with a royal salute as they emerge from the chapel. \u0027It makes me a little bit nervous that we will be front and centre – the Queen and the senior members of the royal family will be stepping out the door right beside us and I\u0027ll probably be positioned about five metres from them.\u0027 Captain Calder, 32, says his unit has been training hard ahead of May 19 and was \u0027stunned\u0027 when he found out he would be getting such a key role.

The manoevre caused the infant\u0027s legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mother\u0027s womb.Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant\u0027s head. It was \u0027re-attached\u0027 to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye.It is claimed the mother was not even in established labour at the time.At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, the mother - known only as Patient A - came to face with Laxman and in a harrowing exchange across the room looked at her and said: \u0027I don\u0027t forgive you - I don\u0027t forgive you\u0027 as the doctor stared down at the floor. The patient then looked away as Laxman\u0027s QC apologised on her behalf.The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, and was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated.In heart breaking evidence Patient A, who was holding two teddy bears in her arms, told the hearing it was the first time she was due to give birth and added: \u0027I had been for a scan the previous Friday and I was told my son was breech and the nurse told me if anything had happened to my son it was going to be a c-section.Patients calling 999 will be told to show handlers a live...\u0027I won’t die for the NHS\u0027: Left-wing GP dubbed \u0027Red Robbo in...Women should convince doctors to give them HRT from age 45...Prosecutions of children possessing cannabis plummet as...Share this article\u0027But when I was taken to the labour suite nobody told me what was happening.

They were checking for the baby\u0027s heartbeat and it had plummeted and that\u0027s when I was told it was going to come out.\u0027I remember them saying I was 2-3cm dilated and I was told to push. Nobody said I was not having a c-section and doing something else instead. Whilst this was going on I was in pain.\u0027The only pain relief I was given was a spray on my tongue. I was told it was meant to loosen my cervix but I was not given gas and air - I was in pain. I had the doctors putting their hands inside me and I had them pushing on my stomach and then pulling me down.\u0027I tried to get off the bed but they pulled me back three times and just said they had to get the baby out. They twice tried to cut my cervix and nobody told me they were going to do it. There was no anaesthetic. I said to them \u0027it doesn\u0027t feel right, stop it, what\u0027s going on, I don\u0027t want to do it\u0027 but nobody responded to me in any way.                            I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared                         - Patient A\u0027s statement to the tribunal \u0027Afterwards I was in a cubicle with a curtain around me and the sister came over to me and told me my son had passed away. I didn\u0027t know the details but Dr Laxman came to see me and the baby\u0027s father was there. Dr Laxman sat on the side of my bed and she said how sorry she was for what happened but I didn\u0027t know the full extent of what happened at that point.\u0027I just said \u0027it\u0027s alright, these things happen, I forgive you.\u0027 She went away but I started screaming when I found out the full extent - I was just crying. I was upset because of the severity of his injury.\u0027I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.\u0027Midwife Mona Chard said: \u0027I was aware she had palpable tightening and some bleeding and she was moved to the labour suite. There was a lot of discussion but I\u0027m not sure who was talking to who. I can\u0027t remember Dr Laxman having a conversation with a patient. I was trying to reassure the patient and comfort her. I remember looking round and people were shocked.\u0027The doctor came over to me and said Dr Laxman had decided there wasn\u0027t going to be a C section and I saw her pull the baby\u0027s feet and cord and she told the patient to push. That is something you cannot forget and Patient A was very distressed.\u0027The hearing was told the woman was given cocodamol before she was examined and Dr Laxman decided on a natural delivery. Lawyer for the General Medical Council Charles Garside QC said: \u0027They tried to coerce the birth through traction as the baby was coming feet first followed by the lower abdomen, upper abdomen and head.\u0027However, there was an obstruction during the birth which proved to be fatal. Dr Laxman allegedly delivered the legs, torso and arms successfully but whilst trying to deliver the head, it got stuck in the cervix.\u0027The attempt to manipulate the baby\u0027s head to come out of the cervix failed because the cervix has clamped onto the baby\u0027s head and despite effort made to assist, these efforts failed. Dr Laxman made three attempts to cut the cervix with scissors but Baby B\u0027s head was separated from his body and his head was stuck inside Patient A\u0027s body.\u0027The doctors had to arrange for the head to be removed. A Caesarean was then carried out - not by Dr Laxman who had become overcome by events - but by Dr C and Dr D, and his head was removed in that way.          The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee (pictured) with a team of other doctors\u0027As a matter of compassion the head was reattached so the appearance of the baby was not too extreme. The baby was shown to his mother so she had the consolation of seeing him.\u0027Mr Garside added: \u0027At no stage was Patient A given any pain relief or instructed on when the c-section was being carried out. At no point did she try to comfort or consolidate or explain to Patient A what was going on.\u0027She failed to perform a Caesarean without general anaesthetic at a time when speed was needed. They should have carried out a category 1 Caesarean section. \u0027The baby had a heartbeat, it was slow, but it was not dead. The choice was taken by Dr Laxman to try a vaginal delivery and this was the wrong choice. They should never use a vaginal delivery in that situation.\u0027New babies are fragile, but this tiny baby was more fragile, and being pulled or twisted could do a lot more damage.\u0027Laxman, who faces being struck off, denies contributing to the death of the baby. Her lawyer Gerard Boyle QC addressed the mother during the hearing and told her: \u0027Dr Laxman has asked me to say she is so very sorry and deeply saddened for the outcome of your baby.\u0027She knows that no amount of words can or will soften your pain but she is hoping that knowing that what she was trying to do was her very best to deliver your baby quickly and sufficiently and she had best intentions at heart. \u0027She did not intend to harm you or harm your baby and she offers her apologies in every possible way. She hopes at some point in time that will make you feel in a way, slightly better.\u0027The hearing continues.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/11/4C0B37BC00000578-5713199-The_cub_he_first_to_be_born_in_Britain_for_a_quarter_of_a_centur-a-177_1525949460680.jpg","title":"Adorable polar bear cub soaks mother Highland Wildlife Park","story":"    The cub\u0027s doting mother  waited nearby as her four-month-old inched closer to the water          The cub, the first to be born in Britain for a quarter of a century - appeared to test out the water with his nose          Hamish the looks like he is about to climb into the water gently to go an see his mother, who slowly swims over to himRather than climb into the water gently, playful Hamish decided to leap through the air and land belly-first - sending water splashing over his patient mother\u0027s head.Photographer Dod Morrison, 52, of Aberdeen, took 1,260 images through the day of the duo and was lucky enough to capture the perfect shot of the cub.Britain¿s first polar bear cub in 25 years is named Hamish...What are these mysterious ice circles in the Arctic?

People think you’re beautiful, you’re thin, you’re rich, you’re photographed on the red carpet, and you get stuck in this category.\u0027She added: \u0027There’s so much more depth beyond all that with Georgina.\u0027          Casa Chapman: Abedin and Hillary Clinton leave the house Weinstein and Chapman once shared following a fundraisers in 2016Abedin also noted that while Chapman may look flawless most of the time, she is more concerned with her kids and making a happy home  than keeping up her appearance - or apperances.\u0027You look at her from the outside, if you don’t know her, and you think, She’s perfect. She could be a model for the clothes she designs,\u0027 says Abedin. \u0027But when you go to the house, she opens the door without any makeup on, and she’s stunning, and she’s funny and goofy with her children—who are clearly the most important people in her life.\u0027Abedin continued: \u0027She’s at the stove making chicken fingers and French fries, and she’s one of the realest people I know. There’s nothing entitled about her. You believe she is someone who works really hard at being a good and present mom, and doing her job really well.\u0027The two women are now both single mothers with full-time jobs, although Chapman is thinking about getting out of the spotlight and moving to a farm upstate.Abedin seems intent on staying in New York City however, where on Monday night she attended the annual Met Gala.Chapman did not attend as she is still laying low, but she was still the talk of the town later in the evening after Scarlett Johansson became the first star to wear a Marchesa gown since the Weinstein scandal. The end: Abedin also praised Chapman as an incredible mother while revealing their sons brought them together as well, with their frequent play dates (Abedin in court with estranged husband Anthony Weiner in September)  No empathy: \u0027People don’t feel sorry for us you don’t get empathy. People think you’re beautiful, you’re thin, you’re rich, you’re photographed ,\u0027 said Abedin (left and Chapman right at a party for Anna Wintour they both attended in June 2017)Chapman\u0027s beauty was also one of the first things that struck Oscar-nominated actor David Oyelowo after the two ran into one another while auditioning for a theater program.  \u0027Well, anyone who has seen Georgina, the first thing that hits you like a ton of bricks is how beautiful she is, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t notice that,\u0027 said Oyelowo, who shot to fame following the critical praise he received for his work in Selma. \u0027But as we talked, I found her to be an interesting and deeply friendly person. She had none of that frostiness that could be associated with a model.\u0027The two kept in touch as Oyelowo pursued acting and Chapman art, and the designer eventually invited the actor to one of her art exhibits.\u0027A lot of the drawings were of fashion, and her work really stood out,\u0027 he said.\u0027I was blown away.\u0027He then asked Chapman to design the costumes for his next play. \u0027And these costumes arrived, made from transparent material into which she’d sewn pieces of mirror to reflect the light. They were extraordinary,\u0027 he recalled of Chapman\u0027s pieces.\u0027They upstaged everything else.\u0027 Fashion industry icon Karen Elson also spoke to the magazine, and revealed she is quick to defend her friend should people get the wrong idea of Chapman\u0027s involvement or responsibility for her husband\u0027s actions.\u0027She must have known is what so many people say at dinner parties,\u0027 said Elson.\u0027The thing that pains me is that when anyone finds out that I know George, that’s the first thing they say. Like she is somehow responsible for his hideous behavior.\u0027Elson then revealed things do not get much better when she reveals that her friend did not know about Weinstein\u0027s alleged behavior.  \u0027When I say, Well, actually she didn’t know, it becomes this other judgment: How could she not have known? Or: Well, that’s on her if she didn’t. It’s so complicated.\u0027          Disbelief: \u0027She must have known is what so many people say at dinner parties,\u0027 said model Karen Elson (l to r: Rita Ora, Naomi Campbell, Oprah Winfrey, Chapman and Elson in 2014). \u0027The thing that pains me is that when anyone finds out that I know George, that’s the first thing they say. Like she is somehow responsible for his hideous behavior\u0027  Looker: Chapman\u0027s beauty was also one of the first things that struck Oscar-nominated actor David Oyelowo after the two ran into one another while auditioning for a theater program (pair above in 2015)The designer said that she is still feeling a wide range of emotions after all these months. \u0027There was a part of me that was terribly naive - clearly, so naive,\u0027 said Chapman. \u0027I have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief!\u0027Chapman said that most of all, she worries her two children - India, 7, and Dashiell - and the effect the scandal will have on them.\u0027I have moments when I just cry for my children. What are their lives going to be? What are people going to say to them?\u0027 she said in tears.\u0027It\u0027s like, they love their dad. They love him. I just can\u0027t bear it for them!\u0027           The scarlet barretter: Johannson became the first women to wear Marchesa since the scandal when she donned a gown by Chapman and Keren Craig to the Met GalaWhen asked if she was ever suspicious about Weinstein\u0027s behavior, Chapman said: \u0027Absolutely not. Never\u0027. She added that he frequently traveled for work and she had never obsessed about where he was.\u0027That\u0027s what makes this so incredibly painful: I had what I thought was a very happy marriage. I loved my life.\u0027Chapman also revealed that she had not offered up any of her dresses to celebrities for the past awards season, putting to rest rumors that women were boycotting the line she co-founded with good friend Keren Craig.\u0027We didn\u0027t feel it was appropriate given the situation. All the women who have been hurt deserve dignity and respect, so I want to give it the time it deserves. It\u0027s a time for mourning, really,\u0027 she said.\u0027A lot of people reached out and said, \u0027Let me wear something\u0027,\u0027 she added about her loyal followers. Scarlett Johansson wore a Marchesa gown to this year\u0027s Met gala.Chapman added that she had shut herself off from the world in the five months after the scandal first broke and hadn\u0027t been out in public since.\u0027I was so humiliated and so broken... that... I, I, I... didn\u0027t think it was respectful to go out,\u0027 she said.\u0027I thought, Who am I to be parading around with all of this going on? It\u0027s still so very, very raw. I was walking up the stairs the other day and I stopped it was like all the air had been punched out of my lungs.\u0027 When the allegations against Weinstein first became public in a series of exposes in the New York Times and The New Yorker, Chapman said it took about two days for the scandal to sink in.\u0027I lost ten pounds in five days. I couldn\u0027t keep food down,\u0027 she said.\u0027My head was spinning. And it was difficult because the first article was about a time long before I\u0027d ever met him, so there was a minute where I couldn\u0027t make an informed decision. And then the stories expanded and I realized that this wasn\u0027t an isolated incident. And I knew that I needed to step away and take the kids out of here.\u0027She fled to Los Angeles and eventually back to London where her parents live.   Georgina Chapman on Life After Harvey Weinstein - Vogue"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/09/4C01DB0E00000578-0-image-a-7_1525854584386.jpg","title":"Netanyahu says Iran crossed red line following Israeli missile launch","story":"Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) on TwitterFACTBOX: Five facts about the Golan Heights | ReutersIsrael security cabinet meets as Iranian official warns \u0027revenge will come\u0027 | The Times of IsraelIDF: Overnight raids set back Iranian military in Syria by \u0027many months\u0027 | The Times of Israel"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/20/4C0F64E600000578-5715057-image-a-26_1525979465804.jpg","title":"At soft landing Horse sends rider flying spectacular buck","story":"    Footage captures a rider sitting steadily on a horse as it trots through an obstacle course            When the female rider tries to approach a body of water for a second time the horse goes wildBut after realising the water isn\u0027t dangerous the horse gallops through the pond - making its rider hold on tighter to the reins.The horse then travels through the obstacle course again and seems to calm down after its moment of excitement.However, when the female rider tries to approach the body of water again the horse goes wild.Playful monkeys flock to Hindu temple and ring the bell by...Toilet humour!

Chingonyi, who is 31, is the first British poet to win the genre-straddling award, which has gone in the past to Max Porter’s novel Grief Is the Thing With Feathers and Fiona McFarlane’s short-story collection The High Places.This year, Chingonyi saw off a shortlist including Sally Rooney’s Conversations With Friends and Gabriel Tallent’s My Absolute Darling. Kumukanda is a Luvale language word connoting initiation, referencing both the rites of passage which boys from the Lovale people of Zambia and Angola go through to become a man, as well as initiation rites for young Londoners. Chair of judges Dai Smith praised Chingonyi’s “original and distinctive voice”, calling Kumukanda “mature and moving”.“Unlike many other books by immigrant writers discussing memories of the homeland and the sensations of a new country, Kayo’s volume is not a lamentation for what he imagines has been lost, but it’s a new kind of celebration, albeit a vexed one, of the joys of living in a new country,” said professor and judge Kurt Heinzelman. “For me, the particular pleasure of this volume is that the particulars of his experience are so emotionally various and culturally erse, and that the whole collection is even more beautiful than the sum of its parts.”Chingonyi, who was born in Zambia and moved to the UK aged six, writes in the poem Self-Portrait as a Garage Emcee of how, “In time, I could rattle off The Slim Shady LP line for line  though no amount of practice could conjure the pale skin  and blue eyes that made Marshall a poet and me  just another brother who could rhyme”. In Casting, he writes: “Three years RADA, two years rep and I’m sick  of playing lean dark men who may have guns.  I have a book of poems in my rucksack,  blank pad, two pens, tattered A-Z, headphones  that know Prokofiev as well as Prince Paul.”In his review for the , Ben Wilkinson called Kumukanda “an authentic and convincing book of poems in its many nuanced portrayals and unflinching reflections … As Valerie Mason-John once dryly observed: ‘Don’t categorise yourself as a black or ethnic poet. There’s no need to, the media will do that for you.’ Chingonyi goes one better, using his lyric panache to honour pop references and cultural experiences of personal and communal significance while also turning the tables, casting a wry and intelligent eye on our wider attitudes.”Actor Michael Sheen, who presented the prize to Chingonyi at a ceremony in Swansea on Thursday night, called Kumukanda “a stunning and hugely culturally relevant collection of poems that keenly explore black culture, masculinity and identity in Britain today”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65cef0993907aa28d1461bd6b1ae109dc3695050/0_0_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=977dcf49cbb89a264cf36e35c49b35f2","title":"quarter of melrose shareholders revolt against pay report","story":"Rebellion at new owner of GKN too late to stop bumper £167m payout shared by four directorsShareholders in turnaround specialist Melrose have staged one of the largest pay revolts this year, amid disgruntlement over a decision to pay a £42m bonus to each of four directors.The Melrose and Direct Line protests extend a series of recent clashes between UK companies and investors that have resulted in bloody noses at Unilever and the housebuilder Persimmon, and forced the satellite firm Inmarsat to rewrite its pay plans.But it will be seen as a rap on the knuckles for a decision to hand out £167m to just four men – the executive chairman, Christopher Miller, the executive vice-chairman, David Roper, the chief executive, Simon Peckham, and the group finance director, Geoffrey Martin.Melrose said after the vote that it would “review the existing ... remuneration arrangements”.But a source close to the company pointed out that shareholders agreed to the long-term incentive plan in 2012, adding that new opposition may have come partly from former shareholders in GKN, the engineering firm Melrose bought earlier this year for £8bn.Melrose’s business model involves buying companies it believes are being run inefficiently and stripping out costs, before selling all or part of the business for a profit.The strategy has led to the company being accused of “asset-stripping”, most recently by political opponents of the GKN deal.Melrose said it delivered returns of £3.6bn to investors between 2012 and 2017 via a string of takeovers that also triggered large windfalls for directors, in contrast to the more conventional pay scheme that long-time GKN investors are used to.As Melrose faced down investors, the insurer Aviva came under fire from small shareholders over executive pay. The firm has pledged to make £14m of goodwill payments to people who lost money by selling its shares after it announced that it could cancel preference shares, triggering a sharp share price drop. Aviva then scrapped the plans, but its handling of the issue has drawn scrutiny from the City watchdog and investors, one of whom described the goodwill payments as “flimsy and patronising fudge”, demanding that directors hand back bonuses.More than a third of Unilever investors registered opposition to its pay plans earlier this month, while Persimmon experienced a revolt against the “grossly excessive” £75m bonus handed to its chief executive, Jeff Fairburn.Binding votes on pay were introduced by the former business minister Vince Cable in 2013, after the so-called Shareholder spring of 2012, when investors lodged protests against executive pay packets that they saw as excessive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/384498a9cf15f5bc6879f6d73aaaa5c30b8e8bfc/61_0_1798_1080/master/1798.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=408660a9da060674fa57aacd2478d6ec","title":"donald glover childish gambino this is america grim surrealism","story":"In his provocative new video This is America, Donald Glover, as his hip-hop alias Childish Gambino, artfully uses the surreal to comment on black livesOnce upon a night in my black life, I bought a 9mm Glock 16 replete with an extended clip off the street, bought it because I’d been robbed for the drugs I sold a time or two and decided against being a mark again, that the next dude that tried me would suffer bullets.Decades ago, that was my America. Decades later, it’s an America that still exists for untold others. And though that shouldn’t be news, it’s a truth worth reminding us. In his artful and provocative new video This is America, Donald Glover, as his hip-hop alias Childish Gambino, attests to as much: “Yeah, this is America (woo ayy)  Guns in my area (word, my area) I got the strap (ayy, ayy)  I gotta carry ’em.”The film is directed by Hiro Murai, Glover’s frequent collaborator on Atlanta, and it is indeed ballistic. It begins in a warehouse with the artist Calvin the Second shown seated and strumming a guitar while choral sounds and choir voices sing: “We just wanna party.” Glover, who has been in the background dances over, bare-chested, mimicking the expressions and gestures of a minstrel. He proceeds to pull a gun from his waistband and shoot Calvin in the back of his now bag-covered head. After that murder, Glover shouts “This is America”, and the music shifts from the choral sounds to a trap music baseline.A crew of school uniform-clad children join Glover and together they perform a choreographed routine that features a panoply of dances including Atlanta’s whip and the South African Gwara Gwara. For most of the video, Glover and the schoolchildren keep right on boogying in seeming obliviousness, while a riot suggestive of several cultural and historical references erupts behind them.Near the middle of the video, Glover side-moonwalks into a room while a choir in faux jubilance sings: “Get your money, black man (get your money).” Someone off-screen tosses Glover an assault rifle and, in a scene suggestive of the Charleston mass shooting, Glover massacres the choir members and decamps while a mass of people rush into the room.Later moments of the video show Glover and his gleeful dance crew grooving again, and also a solo of him channeling Michael Jackson on the roof of an old car – all of which is still backdropped by symbol-laden mayhem. At the end of the video, Glover is shown running in a dark room from a blurry mob of white folks. The video was released after Glover’s hosting and performing duties on the most recent Saturday Night Live. At the time I write this, it has racked up upwards of 47m views as well as dozens of published critiques and umpteen social media posts. The responses have been passionate. Dear White People creator Justin Simien wrote an essay in Twitter posts proclaiming its artistic merits, and scores of celebrities have lauded it with superlatives: “iconic”, “brilliant”, “genius”. A smaller number of viewers, however, have been critical of the video, voicing among their concerns, the morality of Glover’s motives, the effect of portraying gratuitous violence, the wisdom of summoning images of Jim Crow in America’s charged racial climate. For the record, I’m closer to the former camp than the latter, but what’s more important to me than arguing Glover’s brilliance or lack thereof, is interrogating his use of the surreal as an aesthetic to comment on black lives. In his seminal essay Manifesto of Surrealism, the poet and top propagandist for the surrealist movement André Breton describes surrealism as a resolution of what appears, prima facie, as the contradictory states of dream and reality into “a kind of absolute reality, a surreality”. Given this definition, surrealism seems an apt tool for expressing some of the trauma of black life, one that can provide means of portraying what can feel at once like an out-of-this-world nightmare and the far too commonplace. Breton further defines surrealism as expression that is “psychic automatism in its pure state”, one absent of the control of reason or aesthetic or moral concern. At first glance, an automated response devoid of reason or moral concern describes the often fraught treatment of blacks by whites, actions that can’t be defended as reasonable or moral. The full definition of surrealism becomes a way to describe the “absolute reality” that exists at the intersection of black and white lives, which is to say our America. Part of Glover’s brilliance is his resistance to using his work to proselytize or offer advice on how to reconcile the America made of our disparate experiences within its borders. Instead, he invites his audience to examine both the fore and background of their lives, to pose questions. There’s much to see and ask of This is America. The day after it was released I watched it numerous times, each time encouraged by noticing a detail I hadn’t caught the previous time. There’s the hooded figure galloping across the background on the white horse of death, a police car trailing behind him. Is Glover reminding me of the crisis of police shootings? There are the young men, high in the rafters, filming the riot below on their cellphones. Might this be Glover suggesting our complicity in commodifying suffering? There’s the (black?) woman at the end of video, paces behind him, also sprinting from the white mob. Should I read this as the implication that black men can’t provide the protection our women deserve because we’re too busy running from angry white power? Through it all, Glover danced and danced and danced. Should his performance serve as a reminder of the role dance has played in black lives since our captured ancestors were forced to dance on slave ships during the middle passage? I’m not sure, but what I know is that the more I watched the surreal violent images of This is America, the more I reflected on my relationship to what I’d witnessed.Which brought me back to the illegal Glock I mentioned at the outset. In the midst of attempted home invasion, I ran to retrieve it and it was gone, stolen I’d find out later. In a moment that felt every bit an anomaly of my known world and fate, I stood panicked as who-knows-who boomed kicks against my back door. Lucky for me, a white neighbor heard them too, and scared off the would-be robbers by threatening to call the police. Calling the police never once crossed my mind. And that, too, is proof of America. Mine and his. Yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb59b577ed0b38b8dae1ed1d8fd34a19c8190968/0_217_4281_2569/master/4281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=323de00932ef359dd4c76409dc2a2ebe","title":"palm oil orangutans multinationals promises deforestation","story":"Some of the world’s biggest companies are failing in their pledge to stop deforestation by 2020. Don’t let them forget itThey once thrived in Indonesia’s lush, green rainforests but over the last 50 years they have been forced from their home and killed. In the last 16 years alone, 100,000 Bornean orangutans have been lost. All three species – Bornean, Sumatran and the Tapanuli, a species discovered only last year – are now on the critically endangered list. The reason? It started in the 1960s as forests were logged for timber, but now it’s palm oil.Global demand for palm oil has increased six-fold since 1990. It’s in half of all packaged products on supermarket shelves and to avoid it completely would be incredibly tricky. Although palm oil in food can no longer be described simply as vegetable oil and must be clearly labelled (thanks to an EU directive in 2014), there is no such law for products such as soap, shampoo and other cosmetics. The supermarket Iceland’s decision to ditch palm oil from all of its own-brand products was, it says, a response to the palm oil industry’s catastrophic failure to halt deforestation and deal with the problem.Red Ape reveals the truly remarkable work that International Animal Rescue workers are doing on the ground to save these animals. At this crucial stage in their existence, every life saved is vital to their survival. But if we want to save orangutans in the long term, as John Sauven, Greenpeace UK’s executive director, says in the programme, we must save their home – the rainforest.

Rosenthal added: “It’s a bit coarser, it is not quite as gentle or soft as the English translations we know.”The Asterix exhibition is at the Jewish Museum and tells the story of Goscinny’s life and career and his biggest success: the creation, with cartoonist Albert Uderzo, of Asterix, the ancient Gaul who, with his friends, took on the might of Roman occupiers in 50BC.The Asterix books have sold 500m copies worldwide, been translated into 150 languages and adapted into 100 films. But the story of Goscinny himself has been underexplored, the museum believes.“Not many people know about Goscinny’s Jewish heritage and it is a very interesting story,” said Rosenthal. “We wanted to tell it.”Goscinny was born in Paris in 1926 to Eastern European Jewish immigrant parents. He spent his childhood in Argentina, growing up as a French expat child, before moving to New York in 1945, hoping to make it as a cartoonist.On display is a copy of a 1948 letter to the New Yorker magazine complaining that he had still not heard anything after submitting five cartoons. He never made it in the US.His success came in France with creations including a gunslinger called Lucky Luke, a detective called Dick Dicks, and a taxi driver called Strapontin who will cheerfully go anywhere. In one story he travels to Africa, where he teams up with a gorilla who has taken an intelligence serum and can speak Latin. They go in search of the kidnapped son of Professor Petipois.Asterix was by far the biggest success, with its broad appeal to readers of all ages. It was not low brow or high brow, said Rosenthal. “The humour is very sophisticated and works on so many different levels. There is the slapstick element that younger readers might enjoy, but also the very finely tuned and nuanced cultural references that draw on national mythologies and historical incidents.”The exhibition argues that Goscinny’s Jewishness was important in his work, if not explicitly then subtly. “To a certain extent it is kind of speculation,” said Rosenthal. “But I think the sense of humour, the sense of the outsider, the underdog, the immigrant, that kind of diasporist experience he had is just everywhere in his output in a way it often is with secular Jewish artists and writers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c27a5ec9b711410bb8b253e8d90056139302cc6c/0_34_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf20fa7078225435f428595defe2180c","title":"new technology slash aluminium production carbon emissions","story":"Development could transform how one of the world’s most common materials is madeTechnology has been unveiled that could drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions from aluminium production, in a development that could transform the way one of the world’s most common materials is made.Aluminium is used to make cars, construction materials, industrial machinery, electrical products, drinks cans, foil packaging and much more. But its production relies on processes that have changed little since the 1880s when the first smelting processes were pioneered.On Thursday the Canadian government and two of the world’s biggest aluminium producers, Alcoa and Rio Tinto, hailed a “breakthrough” technology that they said would remove carbon dioxide from the smelting process. Executives from the companies said it was “the most significant development in aluminium in a century”.However, she said aluminium production would still require large quantities of energy, and emissions from the production process were only a part of its overall carbon footprint. Smelting aluminium conventionally requires anodes made of carbon-rich material as carbon is a good conductor of electricity as well as being cheap and plentiful. They are used to release the metal from aluminium oxide. During the process the carbon anodes are destroyed, releasing carbon dioxide gas.Alcoa and Rio Tinto’s new process involves the use of a proprietary material they invented and developed over a decade that can be used in place of carbon. When used in smelting, it releases oxygen instead.The new process will not reduce the need for vast quantities of energy in the smelting process, but if it comes from renewable sources it will in effect mean the aluminium produced is carbon-free.Alcoa and Rio Tinto have formed a joint venture, Elysis, to exploit the new smelting material, which they said had been proven to work at industrial scale in plants. Investors in the $144m (£106m) project include the Canadian and Quebec governments, and Apple, which helped broker the deal between the rival aluminium companies and which intends to use the resulting product in its hardware.Products using the new technology are not expected to become commercially available until about 2024. While most of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions come from energy production for electricity, transport, and heating and cooling, a sizeable chunk also comes from industrial processes, such as the production of plastics, petrochemicals and cement. But methods of reducing emissions from industrial processes have proved difficult to develop.Researchers working on cement production, which emits carbon dioxide as calcium carbonate is broken down, have explored using graphene and other materials to reduce emissions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/920c65d83b7d8e2d95cb67969954d02fd55111c6/0_398_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f325c41109a9661fda811d4db1a30db","title":"craft werk meet the maestros of the fashion industry","story":"The worlds of fashion and craft have long been symbiotic, but there’s a new raft of influential designers bringing a new relevance to the relationshipIs craft the new black? Yes, if the line-up of participants of London Craft Week – which kicked off in the capital yesterday – is anything to go by. The five-day event features several influential fashion names including Loewe, Mulberry, Christian Louboutin, Le Kilt, Alice Archer, Gieves \u0026amp Hawkes and Delpozo. All are taking part in workshops, exhibitions and events that aim to make the link between craft and fashion a strong one.And why wouldn’t they? In the past five years, craft has become really cool in fashion. Chanel’s autumnwinter 2016 couture show was dedicated to the women who craft the collections, known as the “petit mains” brands which prioritise the local artisan – such as Hiut Jeans, which reinvigorated the town of Cardigan by setting up its business there – have been hailed as examples to follow. Meanwhile, fashion influencers are giving equal importance to timeless objects – such as glassware and ceramics – as they are the latest fashion trend. The creative director Alex Eagle, for example, sells hand-embroidered shoes alongside hand-thrown tableware by ceramicist Nicola Easton, while Laura Jackson’s forthcoming collection for Habitat in June features what she calls “a Wes Anderson jug – it’s massive and half red, half pink!”Collectively, it has been firmly put on the fashion industry’s agenda – and no brand has done more to plug the gap in the mainstream conscious than Loewe, the go-to luxury fashion label for purposeful pieces that have an artistic twist. Its annual Craft prize, which was set up by its creative director Jonathan Anderson in 2013, celebrates and supports international artisans who “demonstrate an exceptional ability to create objects of superior aesthetic value” in disciplines including ceramics, bookbinding, jewellery, leather, textiles, metal and wood. It awards €50,000 (£44,100) to the winner.At Mulberry, which is hosting demonstrations of how its leather goods are handmade in its London flagship, an apprenticeship programme was established in 2006 to preserve the skill set that is at risk of being lost from such spending cuts.If honouring craft is crucial to maintaining a fashion workforce, its current renaissance can also be attributed to the current rhetoric surrounding sustainability, says Samantha Roach, founder and designer at London fashion week favourite Le Kilt.“Young people in particular seem much more interested in the provenance of their clothing. They want to understand how their clothes are made and who has made them,” she says. Traditional craftsmanship is at the heart of Roach’s brand, which is running workshops over LCW in collaboration with the textile design consultancy Norn, to help educate attendees on artisanal craft techniques. It also has a current exhibition, Innovation Through Tradition, at the Michael Hoppen Gallery.“We want our customers to understand the value in an item of clothing that has its own personal story through repair, provenance and DIY touches,” says Roach. “For example, we have unravelled discarded tartan fabrics and used the yarns to weave into patches, therefore ensuring nothing goes to waste. Subculture has always been an important reference point, and we see craft as a form of anti-consumerism – it’s our own statement against disposable fashion. By educating people on the impact that clothing production has on the environment, we hope it will encourage people to invest their garments.”Craft does not, however, equate only to something handmade in the fashion landscape. It can incorporate specialist digital processes too, says the fashion designer Alice Archer, whose brand is famous for its intricate embroidery. “When I was a student, I learned how to hand-embroider and I worked for years as a hand-embroiderer, practising the skill. Now in my collections, I use digital embroidery like it is hand embroidery. I programme every single stitch on my computer, as if I am embroidering it by hand. This gives the embroideries some irregularities and a more emotional and human feeling, while making them infinitely reproducible.”Archer, who has pieces from her archive on display in the windows of The Place on Brook Street, during LCW also notes the “strong desire for modern takes on craft techniques such as embroidery, smocking, hand painted and printed pieces, and historic detailing” in the luxury fashion industry at the moment. “Clients seek unique products and experiences and want clothing to feel personal – I think ... people will invest more money in special pieces that are more timeless and classic and involve special craft processes.”See the full London Craft Week schedule here.

It is a frothy biopic about Jean-Luc Godard and his second wife, Anne Wiazemsky, the star of his 1967 film La Chinoise who was just 19 when she met the 37-year-old Godard. Instead, the focus has become Lars von Trier, the director who gave Martin her first professional acting role, as sex addict Joe, in the explicit four-hour epic Nymphomaniac.Von Trier had a reputation for years for making actors suffer for their art, especially female actors. But when I ask Martin, 27, about him, she describes their working relationship as “amazing”. “He has his flaws, but I don’t know anyone who loves women more than he does,” she says. “I didn’t know how a film set worked and he had patience with me.” If anything, she says, it was Von Trier who agonised over the explicit scenes in Nymphomaniac. “Sometimes he’d freak out and we’d have to take 10 minutes. He’d be like: ‘I can’t make you do this.’ I was like: ‘I don’t mind.’”The allegations against Von Trier stem from a Facebook post by Björk alleging she had been harassed by an unnamed Danish director.The man was widely identified as Von Trier, and Björk followed up with another Facebook post with more allegations of harassment, denied by Von Trier. In November, Danish authorities launched an investigation into claims of sexual abuse at his Zentropa studio. Former employees talked of a culture of bullying and intimidation – one woman claimed she was sacked for refusing to skinny dip with the director.I want to talk about Von Trier and Björk, I say to Martin. “Did Björk name him?” she replies warily.Not outright, but she has only starred in one feature film and identified her abuser as Danish. Does Martin stand by her support of him? “Yes, I still stand by that. I don’t know what happened and I can’t pretend that I do. And I can’t take a position on something that hasn’t officially been discussed. It’s not my place. I worked with Lars and I had an amazing experience. I still speak to Lars. And as much as he is a man with a lot of anxieties and problems, I’ve not seen this side of him. And I hope that’s not a side that he has. He’s very complex, yes. I just don’t see him being that sort of person. Until I’m proven wrong.”She pauses. It’s obvious she’s finding the conversation difficult: “The behaviour that Björk talked about is atrocious and it should never happen. An actor should never be put in that position.” She says she was shocked when she first heard Björk’s claims. “You can say he’s difficult to work with, you can say he’s depressed, you can say he’s got a problem with alcohol. But I never thought that would be something that would be used to describe him.”With waifishly delicate features that give the impression of vulnerability, Martin has – predictably – her own experience of film industry sleaze. “There are a lot of arrogant men in the entertainment industry. You know there is abuse of power”She has never met Harvey Weinstein, though she’d had the Harvey conversation with her agent: “About what to do if you get a meeting with Harvey. It’s crazy and terrifying, but every young actress had that conversation with their agent. And you meet producers who are not Harvey. I’ve definitely had inappropriate comments. I’ve had a producer tell me: ‘I’m thinking about you constantly.’ He didn’t say: ‘I’m thinking about you for this project.’ He said: ‘I’m thinking of you constantly.’ It’s definitely inappropriate. You can’t say that to an actor.”Born in Paris, Martin’s father is French and her mother English. She moved to London at 18 to study media and culture at university, while modelling part-time. Acting classes were a hobby. She didn’t even have an agent when Von Trier cast her in Nymphomaniac not long after graduating. “I never thought I’d get the part,” she says. “I loved acting classes, but it was very low key. Never a job job.”Even now, she suffers from a twinge or two of impostor syndrome: “The first day on shoot is like the first day at school. I have this weird thing like are they going to find me out, that I’m not a real actress. It’s totally irrational and it’s definitely not productive.”I ask her about sex scenes. Martin is a total pro. For Nymphomaniac, she had a separate contract for nudity and there was a spreadsheet detailing every sexual act in the film to avoid uncertainty over who was doing what. Martin wore a prosthetic vagina for some scenes, and a porn double performed the actual sex scenes. These days, she says, she mostly finds herself battling for more male nudity in scripts. “Usually it’s the women doing full-frontal. What about the men? If you want to show a love scene, there needs to be balance. You’re not showing masturbating, you’re showing two people making love.”I suspect Martin can be rather steely. I get a taste of her froideur when I bring up the controversial open letter signed by Catherine Deneuve and other high-profile French women attacking #MeToo for going too far. I put it to Martin that the letter pretty much confirmed the feeling that French women are a bit, well, less feminist. “I don’t think that French women are less feminist. If you look at Simone de Beauvoir, she was French and she wrote one of the founding texts of feminism,” Martin says curtly. Being half-French, half-English she says she is constantly seeing the differences between the two mentalities. “It’s a lot easier to say no in French than it is in English. I find it so satisfying to say no to a French person. Whether it’s for noodles or for a job.” Her English side is more apologetic. “I find myself saying sorry to someone even if they’ve pushed me in the street.”When Nymphomaniac came out, Martin was frustrated by journalists treating her like a Ming vase. “People talked about the film like something really difficult had happened to me. Instead of an actress deciding to make a film. That was annoying. I wouldn’t have said yes if I wasn’t happy with it. I felt like I had to tell people that it was my decision.”The sex scenes in Redoubtable, on the other hand, are tongue-in-cheek, played for laughs. Godard goes down on Anne Wiazemsky, but comes up for air to bang on about revolutionary politics. Redoubtable pokes fun at the New Wave enfant terrible: in his late 30s, balding and terrified of becoming old and irrelevant. But it plays his relationship with Wiazemsky, as a comedy. In reality, Godard was jealous, possessive, even cruel at times. His age and experience put all the power in his corner. But Martin points out that Wiazemsky remembered the relationship affectionately the film is based on her memoir. “We have to let her have her relationship. They loved each other. That’s something we can’t judge: someone’s love for someone else. You have to respect that.”If there’s one takeaway from Redoubtable it is that the job description of muse is long and not particularly tempting: cook, cleaner, mother, cheerleader, lover, cat-to-kick, therapist. When she worked with Von Trier, a few interviewers called Martin his “new muse”, but she’s unimpressed. “I find the word ‘muse’ very belittling,” Martin says. “It’s been far too romanticised. If you look at Picasso and Freud, they had muses and were in relationships with the women. Look at Frida Kahlo. She couldn’t sustain a relationship like that and make her own work. I want to be Stacy Martin, not blah blah’s muse.”Redoubtable is released on 11 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60e5f6cbe82a8450e58e6a5ea47a406ea99bf2e9/159_201_3151_1890/master/3151.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bcef8bbde0129b7e1baf3b3ed8f0131","title":"wayne rooney leave everton former england captain allardyce","story":"Wayne Rooney will await clarification from Everton on the club’s future management before deciding whether to end his Goodison Park comeback after only one season.The 32-year-old has an offer from DC\u0026nbspUnited to move to MLS in July, with the Washington club willing to give the former England captain a two‑year contract. DC\u0026nbspUnited have held talks with Rooney’s representative, Paul Stretford, but are one of several overseas opportunities available to the boyhood Evertonian.Rooney’s preference is to remain at Everton where he is under contract until next summer. Everton have an option to extend his deal by a further 12 months but doubts over whether it will be activated, coupled with his reduced playing time under Sam Allardyce, have left Rooney considering a move. Everton have denied that their leading goalscorer this season has asked to leave.The former Manchester United striker has had a mixed campaign in a poor Everton side. He scored 11 goals in an impressive first half of the season, securing several important victories in the process, but his last goal came on 18\u0026nbspDecember and he has been frustrated by his deployment under Allardyce. Rooney reacted furiously to being substituted in the 57th minute of the Merseyside derby last month and he had been withdrawn at the same point against Manchester City the previous week.Rooney’s opportunities next season would appear limited under Allardyce but the 63-year-old’s future at Everton is uncertain. The striker wants clarity on Allardyce’s position, or whether he features in any new manager’s plans, before deciding whether to move with his young family to the US.Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s major shareholder, has several key issues to address beyond Rooney. Despite Allardyce’s claims to the contrary, Moshiri is expected to commence another overhaul of the club’s management structure with Marcel Brands, the technical director of the Dutch champions PSV\u0026nbspEindhoven, lined up for a similar role on Merseyside.Brands’s arrival would affect Steve Walsh’s position as director of football and, as well as a replacement for Allardyce, Moshiri must also appoint a successor to the departing chief executive Robert Elstone and advance plans for a new stadium at Bramley-Moore dock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf1d1637f766fbbc13c9928ffa2c85eb902d6ba2/0_64_4510_2706/master/4510.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0eff80b957bc556cba5f5e32859ebbf","title":"west brom darren moore premier league relegation","story":"Having secured our Premier League status with the great victory against Manchester United last week, myself\u0026nbspand the rest of our squad were much more comfortable in our hotel on Tuesday evening as we sat down to watch Swansea and\u0026nbspSouthampton in their crucial match and see the effect the result would have at the bottom end of the table.As the game progressed and produced a massive win for the Saints, it not only put Swansea in huge trouble but also consigned West Bromwich Albion to their inevitable fate regardless of their outstanding resurgence under Darren Moore.The case of West Brom and especially the superb results they have picked up recently – beating Manchester United away and a strong Tottenham team at The\u0026nbspHawthorns – is a curious one in terms of how a manager can affect his players’ performances so critically and how, in the bigger picture of our national game, we consider and appoint head coaches.Frankly, I’m amazed we are still in the position of discussing whether Moore is the right man for West Brom in the long term because he has gained outstanding performances and results in his short tenure and the players have shown organisation, spirit and togetherness to get close to the seemingly impossible task of survival from such a grim position in the table.As a player I hear and understand the question from supporters who pay their hard-earned money, asking how it is possible for the same group of professionals to play in the way they have under Moore, when previously under Alan Pardew and Tony Pulis (both managers with huge experience) they were losing games on a regular basis without the fight, character and belief they have been displaying recently.I agree that we as players have to be accountable for our inidual performances and collective results but in football, as in any other industry, the organisation, tactical plan, culture, inspiration and day-to-day training sessions are laid down by the manager, who has a huge role in defining the confidence levels, belief and spirit within the football club.These elements can make such a big difference on the field of play where instead of players having doubts about where they are heading or even being unclear of the tactical plan, they are instead being led by someone who instils confidence and belief into them and can convey their tactics and methodology concisely and clearly on the training pitch from Monday to Friday, enabling success on a Saturday.Had Moore been appointed 10 games earlier I doubt any of us, with the benefit of hindsight, would have put money on them being relegated this season. This situation draws parallels with a club in Germany two seasons ago when Hoffenheim were in a similarly desperate position to the one West Brom found themselves in, albeit earlier in the season. Staring at relegation and needing something different and fresh, they turned to a 28-year-old coach from their youth ranks to reinvigorate the team’s performances and take them\u0026nbspforward.If you fast-forward two years, after not only an improbable “great escape” that year but consistent improvement and qualification into the Champions League play-offs, Julian Nagelsmann is one of the hottest coaching properties in world football. His short period as a manager is recognised in Germany for being innovative, intelligent and fearless – often using young German players but still being ahead of the curve in terms of the evolution\u0026nbspof the game.I’m not saying Moore would definitely be of the same mould and ability as Nagelsmann, but why can’t he be? If we look objectively at the recent form and performances of his players the upturn has been nothing short of spectacular and I have said before that if we want our national game to improve and stay ahead we need chances to be given to our next generation of coaches who show they can do the job. Moore has proven that for sure – and in a short space of time.The wider picture of today’s game in our country and the managerial merry-go-round that is being analysed and debated by supporters and the media needs to be challenged.We talk about the increasingly difficult pathways our young players have in making first teams while we also say aspiring coaches who want to manage at the top level should play at lower-level clubs and in under-23 roles. But the sad fact is that even with success in the lower leagues or with under-23 sides these coaches are still not given a chance at the sharp end and instead we appoint “safe, experienced” managers from these shores or big-name coaches from abroad who, not by coincidence, were given a chance to shine much earlier at a higher level by more open‑minded, forward-thinking boardrooms or technical directors.Watching the emotional celebrations at the final whistle at the Hawthorns last Saturday after a last‑gasp win against Spurs I couldn’t help but think the legend Cyrille Regis was looking down from above with pride at his club.This was a man who broke down barriers in terms of prejudice with his grace, poise and skill. I hope West Brom’s directors at least give Moore the deserved opportunity to emulate Regis, having displayed the very same qualities as his hero."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5ecad867c38e5904b12b444a27e8591323cad19/60_155_3290_1975/master/3290.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eccdd3ec1e78987ac33158956c43bfd2","title":"west ham united v manchester united premier league live","story":"90+3 mins: United have brought on Eric Bailly, who replaces Valencia.90+3 mins: Manchester United, timewasting in a bid to take a point from a dreary game at West Ham, want to make another substitution.90+2 mins: Ashley Young comes on for Sánchez.90+1 mins: Lanzini shoots, but it’s both high and wide. The referee wants three minutes of stoppage time.90 mins: Now Lindelof takes out Carroll, and West Ham have a free kick 10 yards outside the penalty area.90 mins: Pogba dealt with Noble’s aggression pretty well, to be fair. The incident could have been worse.88 mins: Eventually Pogba is booked, for an exceedingly cynical trip on Noble. Noble’s reaction was furious, and involved grabbing Pogba’s face and chest-bumping him aggressively. He too is booked.87 mins: Handbags! Pogba and Noble square up in midfield, and suddenly everyone’s involved!86 mins: An ugly coming-together between Pogba and Carroll near the half-way line, in which Carroll shoved Pogba and Pogba, from the floor, raised a leg to bring down Carroll. The referee decided it was a West Ham free kick.85 mins: It was, Adam Roberts informs me, Paul Pogba who had the shot from the halfway line. I should have guessed.84 mins: Arnautovic, who is everything and everywhere for West Ham, collects the ball, shields it well and lays back to Noble, who blasts a 30-yarder way high.82 mins: Arnautovic is released down the left again, and this time he checks back and lifts a cross towards Carroll. It’s nearly perfect, but Jones stretches his neck muscles to flick it away. Carroll picks it up, but his cross goes over Arnautovic and drops to a defender, with no other West Ham player much interested in joining the attack.80 mins: Chance for West Ham! Noble lifts the ball over the United defence, and Arnautovic runs onto it and, from out to the left of goal, flings his left foot at it as it drops. It would, had the volley flown in, have been a superb goal. It didn’t.79 mins: United pass it around the box for an age, with no apparent idea how to get it inside the box. Eventually they just give it away.77 mins: The brief swell of excitement that followed Carroll’s introduction has quietened, as United control possession.74 mins: Lingard is coming off, and Rashford coming on.73 mins: Pogba and Kouyaté compete for a header in midfield, and the West Ham player lands badly and stays down. He is receiving treatment.73 mins: Marcus Rashford is about to come on.71 mins: Moments later Pogba, from the corner of the area, curls a shot towards the far post, but it doesn’t quite curl enough.70 mins: A shot from the halfway line! I’m not sure which United player took it, and for some reason the commentators didn’t even mention it took place, but I’m pretty sure it did. It went wide.69 mins: Carroll’s arrival appears to have lifted West Ham, and their fans. Still no chances, though.66 mins: West Ham make the night’s first substitution, bringing Andy Carroll on to help Arnautovic out a bit, and taking Masuaku off.65 mins: United, pressing gently, win a corner. Smalling, beyond the far post, reaches it first but heads emphatically wide.62 mins: Now Valencia crosses from the right, and Pogba heads wide at the far post.60 mins: Arnautovic is really troubling United, and as he runs into the area Jones slides in foolishly, and is extraordinarily lucky not to hit ankle. Arnautovic continues, spears the ball in, and Jones has somehow got back in time to get in the way.55 mins: Lingard has yet another shot. It’s a decent good one, straight down the middle of goal but dipping nastily at pace as Adrián has to deal with it. He can’t catch it, but he can stop it rolling dangerously away from him, and he gathers in short order.53 mins: I’m eating some grapes.51 mins: The first half wasn’t the most inspiring, but if the TV microphones are anything to go by the fans kept their voices admirably loud throughout. Since half time, though, even they have given up.48 mins: Sánchez is played in on the left side of the area, and dances past the advancing Adrián. But he’s out wide, and when he looks up only McTominay is in the area, so he tries an audacious crazy-angle curling shot, and fails.48 mins: Lingard shoots into a defender’s shin, and then from the resulting corner crosses onto a defender’s head.47 mins: Turkey-related point of information from Simon Gill: “It’s actually meatballs rather than kebabs, and the reference is pretty oblique, but yes, this Cemal feller is one happy boy tonight.”The players are back out! Yes they are!Here’s a photograph of happy, excited players celebrating a great achievement, just in case we don’t have another opportunity to see such a thing tonight.Exciting football update: “Huge upset in the Turkish Cup final, as tiny Akhisarspor beat giants Fenerbahce 3-2,” notes Kari Tulinius. “Before this Akhisarspor hasn’t won anything except for a solitary second ision title a few years ago. This is like when Coventry won the FA Cup in 1987.” Here’s an excited person tweeting about it. Something to do with kebabs, I think (really).45+2 mins: It is goalless. It is half time. It can only get better. Unless it stays the same.45+1 mins: Save! Lingard’s shot is dipping towards the far corner, but Adrián es to his left to push it away. Not a hard save, but a good-looking one.45+1 mins: Where the referee has got the one additional minute he’s decided to play from is beyond me.45 mins: “How good has Smalling been this season?” enthuses Arthur Tee. “He is the one consistently played CB in, I think, the League’s best defence yet it appears Southgate thinks he isn’t good enough to go to the WC? Laughable.” It’s a game of opinions, innit?44 mins: Sánchez chips the ball into the area, Herrera flicks it on, and Pogba, having controlled it, seems astonished that the referee spotted his totally obvious handball.43 mins: Sánchez loses control of the ball again and falls over again, and this time the referee takes pity on him. Nothing comes of it. 41 mins: Pogba’s 30-yarder is quite handsome, but whistles just wide of the near post.40 mins: Pogba’s touch is overstrong and, stretching, he lands his foot on Ogbonna’s. Contact is brief and accidental, neither player makes much of it, and the referee doesn’t mind it. 39 mins: I’ve got to disagree with Gary Weightman, incidentally. It’s not that slow. It might even turn out OK. It is largely without purpose, but that happens at this time of year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebafd2fe074f3cfa522535908b3e071ad5ed067b/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50169c10e3f0e7e190271ade6666cfe6","title":"dignity community hope haiti jalousie in pictures","story":"Behind the brightly painted exterior of Jalousie, one of Haiti’s largest slums, lies a community struggling with a lack of sanitation, intermittent electricity and rivers of plastic waste.

Delicate, early stalks are best steamed and served with buttery hollandaise: here’s a foolproof recipe you can have on the table in 10 minutes.Cut the butter into roughly 1cm cubes. The butter should be fridge-cold, and preferably unsalted, so it’s easier to control the seasoning of the sauce. Put it in a small, heavy-based saucepan and, as insurance against disaster, fill the sink with cold water and boil a small amount in the kettle (see steps 4 and 7).Separate the eggs, and reserve the whites for something else –meringues, mousses, whisky sours or depressingly low-fat omelettes. They’ll keep, covered, in the fridge for a couple of days, or freeze in ice cube trays or bags (make sure you label the latter, so you know how many are in there). Put the yolks in the pan with the butter and add two tablespoons of cold water.Turn the heat on very low under the cold pan and start stirring – it’s easiest to start with a wooden spoon. As the butter gradually melts, the sauce will begin to thicken: do not be tempted to hurry the process by turning the heat up, or the mixture is likely to curdle. The sides of the pan should be cool enough to touch at all times.Keep stirring vigorously then, as the butter melts, switch to whisking – it’s important that you now don’t stop whisking until the sauce is ready, so if the doorbell rings, plunge the pan into the cold water in the sink (see step 1) to halt the cooking process, otherwise you risk the egg scrambling before it has a chance to form an emulsion with the butter.Once all the butter has melted, turn up the heat very slightly and whisk vigorously until the sauce has thickened sufficiently for your purposes (see step 8). If the sauce begins to steam at any point, plunge the pan into the cold water in the sink at once, and keep whisking until it calms down.Add a tablespoon of lemon juice, then season the sauce to taste. Keep warm until ready to serve: hollandaise will not reheat successfully, so it’s best eaten at once, but if you do have to make it in advance, it’s best stored in a Thermos flask or in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water.You may be able to rescue a curdled sauce by whisking in a little boiling water (hence the kettle in step 1), but if that fails to fix the problem, pour the split sauce into a heatproof jug, clean the pan and whisk another egg yolk with a splash of water in there. Gradually whisk in the curdled hollandaise until it’s all incorporated, then carry on where you left off.I like my hollandaise fairly liquid when serving it with asparagus, because it can be poured over the steamed spears, but if you’re using it as a dip or making eggs benedict, you may prefer a more mayonnaise-like consistency. If it thickens too much, whisk in a little hot water from the kettle (see step 1) to thin it down.For béarnaise, simmer four tablespoons of white-wine vinegar with four tablespoons of water, a finely chopped shallot and three tarragon stalks stripped of their leaves, until reduced by half. Cool, strain, then add to the hollandaise at step 2, and stir in the chopped tarragon leaves at the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d1197656ebed02fb97901d6090430f64bd5efce/0_39_640_384/master/640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=352e0110deedc14e40859ea48bea5218","title":"french familys last three bottles of 1774 wine up for auction","story":"Other bottles of same wine – among the oldest in the world – previously fetched up to €57,000Bottles of wine believed to be among the oldest in the world are to go on sale at auction in France this month.Three bottles of 1774 vin jaune from the Jura region of eastern France, known as “the wine of kings and the king of wines”, are listed at up to €20,000 (£17,600) each but could fetch almost double that.The 87cl bottles have been carefully guarded by several generations of descendants of Pierre Vercel, a celebrated 17th-century winemaker, and are the last remaining in the family’s cellar.In 1994 a group of wine connoisseurs, scientists and oenologists tested a bottle of the wine and declared it excellent, suggesting it should be revisited in 100 years’ time. It was described as a “golden amber-coloured nectar, with flavours of nuts, spices, curry, cinnamon, vanilla and dried fruits”, and given a score of 9.4 out of 10.Two bottles from the same collection were sold at auction in 2011 and 2012 for €57,000 and €38,000 respectively.At the time of the 2012 sale in Switzerland, Michael Ganne, the head of Christie’s Geneva wine sale, wrote: “Amongst the precious highlights from the sale is a very special bottle of vin jaune dated 1774 … Made to last centuries when of good quality … this extraordinary bottle is probably the oldest unfortified example of what is to be still an astounding wine and another true rarity for wine lovers and connoisseurs.”It is said that the chemist Louis Pasteur, who was born in Jura and was a close friend of Vercel’s grandchildren, celebrated his entry into the Académie Française in 1881 with a bottle of 1774 vin jaune, then a relatively young 107 years old.Vercel, who came from a line of celebrated winemakers dating back to the 14th century, is credited as the inventor of vin jaune, a type of white wine made only in Jura and similar to dry fino sherry, except it is not fortified. It is made and matured in a barrel under a film of yeast, called the voile, which is believed to improve its longevity.As well as the 1774 wine, the auction includes 99 other bottles, the last remaining from the Vercel cellar. They will go under the hammer in Lons-le-Saunier on 26 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd9ad36ce77f11fa6c35413ac0c6b7804e7f1605/2_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebc86aabe7cdd5333d72b91ae52caa77","title":"taylor swift katy perry when actual olive branch cant end froideur","story":"For six years, the spat between the stars has been fought out on social media.

She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me.” Has there ever been a more corporate musical feud than that between Taylor Swift and\u0026nbspKaty Perry? Almost certainly. Perhaps asset stripper behaviour is the tab you pick up for high art. All Saints split up over who got to wear a\u0026nbspparticular jacket to the Capital FM Christmas party – but I guess we all got to keep the music.Even so, it could almost send you into a decline to think that not only is Taylor’s song Bad Blood literally about Katy’s poaching of precisely three backing dancers – but that Taylor was willing to volunteer this information to Rolling Stone even at\u0026nbspthe peak of her pop-cool and megastardom.I mean … just say it’s about kicking a baroque drug addiction or being compromised as a CIA asset.

Failing that, at least do the music journalist’s work for him and explain that in the turbo-commercialised, 18-hour-day pop Wall Street that you dominate, backing dancers are just a way of keeping score.Anyway, that’s all water under one of Taylor’s famous bridges now. By way of a recap: the backing-jacking took place in 2012, and ever since, Taylor and Katy have been engaged in remote sniping. There have been disparaging interviews, there have been lyrical swipes – but\u0026nbspas time went on, Katy began to\u0026nbspmodulate the attacks into professions of hope that the pair could one day be friends again.

On the eve of Taylor’s latest tour, Katy sent Baroness Swift a real, physical olive branch and a letter. We know this because Taylor took the immediate decision to Instagram herself opening it. “So I just got to my dressing room,” she explained in a video captioned Thank You Katy, “and found this actual olive branch. This means so much to me.” Taylor also posted a picture of the branch, showing the partially readable note, which began: “Hey Old Friend – I’ve been doing some reflecting on past miscommunications and hurt feelings between us”, and in which the phrase “deeply sorry” was also\u0026nbspvisible.Hmmm. I know Taylor only revealed this private communication to 107 million of her closest followers\u0026nbsp… but was that quite the\u0026nbspway to go? Or was it the most hilariously destructive use of a branch since Basil Fawlty took one to\u0026nbsphis Austin 1100 Countryman on Gourmet Night?If we were being charitable, perhaps we’d say that this is just how\u0026nbspcelebrities are. When Victoria Beckham posts love messages and pictures of their children to David Beckham on Instagram, it is not our place to wonder: “Can’t you just go down to the kitchen and tell him?” A\u0026nbspcertain amount of performance is part of the brand. None of which is to suggest such marriages are all a show, but clearly a wider audience is deemed to help, or they wouldn’t choose it.The great sadness, of course, is that social media’s tightening grip on human interaction has yet to evolve to a stage where arguing celebrities spend as much time crafting post putdowns of each other on social media. For the followers they are seeking to engage, this would obviously be much more erting. Stars themselves would be encouraged to raise their dialogue game, and disport themselves as if they were sparring in an Instragram version of Noël Coward’s Private Lives, as opposed to the bit of the Hallmark cards factory where rejected Valentine slogans go to die. As for Taylor and Katy, though, do imagine your lack of surprise to learn that Katy is reportedly “puzzled” by the decision to publicise her gesture. It may be that the note’s apology is more nuanced than its first few lines\u0026nbspsuggest it may be a certain lack of grace on Taylor’s part. Would it really have hurt so much to react with a “soz for being a bit of a monster too”?Either way, the suggestion is that this froideur isn’t quite as over as it might be, and is still making its interminable progress to iteration 18 of Ryan Murphy’s Feud series.As for how to inject new life into the peace process, what about the backing dancers? Surely the three of them should be produced whence they have been rendered, and given the chance to tell their stories in this\u0026nbspmost intractable conflict of the modern era. Someone – perhaps Archbishop Desmond Tutu – should\u0026nbsptake the testimonies of what happened back when they stopped grinning through ball changes behind Taylor, and defected to grinning through ball changes behind Katy. However painful this\u0026nbspmight be, the chance for reconciliation is surely worth paying\u0026nbspthe price.But who to instigate it all? If only there was someone in the news who\u0026nbsphad just succeeded in conjuring hopes of a lasting peace with the showy production of three other iniduals who had essentially been treated as pawns in a much larger and more dangerous game. Should any such diplomatic titan come to mind, do suggest them to the relevant authorities at your very earliest convenience.Thrilling news from Cannes, where Sylvester Stallone’s senior years are\u0026nbspto stress-test another of his action franchises.

That said, Sly credited its message with encouraging the Myanmar people to\u0026nbspoverthrow the military junta. A\u0026nbspverdict which turned out to be almost as much of a hostage to future events as the final shot of Rambo III, set in Afghanistan, which dedicates the movie “to the brave mujahideen fighters”.Anyway, the last time Stallone was talking about Rambo V, its plot sounded like something our hero might have hallucinated in First Blood. It was going to happen in the\u0026nbspPacific Northwest, Sly explained,\u0026nbspand involve the hunting\u0026nbspof A Creature.Mm.

The contest has sparked a fierce battle between local politicians who are keen to attract hundreds of high-profile jobs to their region.Channel 4 won a drawn-out battle with the government against being privatised and forced to move its entire operation out of the capital. Instead it reached a deal that will involve transferring around 300 staff from its 800-strong Westminster headquarters to a base outside London, which will include a TV studio and host board meetings. The broadcaster has said its second base must be in a city with a working population of more than 200,000 people, travel time to London of less than three hours, and high-quality physical and digital infrastructure. Channel 4 has also pledged to build smaller regional “creative hubs” in two additional cities spend substantially more money on programming from production companies based outside London and co-host Channel 4 News from a studio outside the capital.Birmingham has long been seen as the leading candidate, with the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, saying he was confident of bringing the broadcaster to the region.Glasgow’s bid has become a major cause for the Scottish government, with the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, backing the bid and her Scottish National party holding a debate in the Westminster parliament to make the case.The Sheffield bid, chaired by the former Labour sports minister Richard Caborn, says the city offers “unrivalled” expertise and digital knowledge, while Leeds has promised “fascinating cultures, ersity and talents that are worth being discovered and showcased”.Smaller towns and cities, ranging from Leamington to Port Talbot, have expressed an interest in applying for one of the broadcaster’s creative hubs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/386d0c93bcf482cd4209e5460ea10adbd86eb586/0_308_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03af73a0cad3865c246a9754d5eaf87a","title":"whirlpool should be made to recall tumble dryers say mps","story":"Committee accuses firm of not taking responsibility for defects that have caused household firesWhirlpool should be ordered to recall millions of tumble dryers as they pose a serious risk of bursting into flames, a group of MPs has told the government. Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, has written to ministers calling for them to take action over Whirlpool’s refusal to “take proper responsibility” for the defects.Since 2004, more than 750 domestic fires are thought to have been started in homes by the affected tumble dryers. Fluff in contact with the heating element catches fire. The risk applies to older dryers sold under the Hotpoint, Creda, Indesit, ProLine and Swan brands.The company has been replacing or repairing an estimated 3.8m dryers across the UK after identifying the fault in November 2015. Whirlpool did not issue a product recall, initially telling customers they could continue to use their dryer while waiting for modification, provided it was not left unattended. That changed in February 2017 when it said customers should unplug and stop using the machines.However, a number of the “upgraded” machines have also gone up in smoke, prompting the new demand for a formal recall. “Whirlpool continue to refuse to take proper responsibility for defects in their tumble dryers, leaving many people still in the frightening situation where machines are acting as potential fire hazards in their own homes,” Reeves said. “We need the government to step in and ensure consumers get the protection they deserve. Given the woeful paucity of Whirlpool’s actions to remedy this situation, the Office for Product Safety and Standards must now act and consider a full recall of defective machines to ensure this national product safety issue is resolved.”Alex Neill, of the consumer group Which?, said Whirlpool has admitted that at least a million of their tumble dryers still in people’s homes could be a potential fire risk.“Their approach to handling the issue for customers has been an absolute shambles. There are still serious concerns about whether Whirlpool’s modification programme is actually effective. It’s time for a full recall,” he said.Whirlpool said: “We proactively raised this product safety issue in 2015 and have worked diligently and responsibly to resolve it.“The scale of this campaign has been unprecedented as we have achieved a resolution rate more than three times the industry average for a product recall. We have provided resolutions to all consumers who have registered, and resolved over 1.7m affected tumble dryers.“We have total confidence in the modification, it was extensively tested before and after being implemented, and there have been no incidents where it has shown to be ineffective. “An external review with the input from three independent experts in fire safety, product safety, and engineering, concluded that the modification remains the most effective way of rectifying this issue for consumers. “Recent criticisms of the effectiveness of the modification are based on fundamental technical misunderstandings of what it addresses.“We have cooperated with Trading Standards and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy at every stage of the campaign. Trading Standards confirmed, following an internal review by independent experts, that the modification programme remains the most effective way of resolving this issue.“We continue to urge consumers to contact us immediately if they believe they still own an affected appliance. We can assure consumers that if they contact us now, they can receive a resolution within one week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fc50bf29e30b340f5a99c8d55d41ba812e781af/0_671_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42318946bac2cb57d436ee55cb8acca7","title":"arctic monkeys tranquility hotel base casino review","story":"Channelling Serge Gainsbourg and the Beach Boys, the Arctic Monkeys move on from stadium indie in a smart album that sees Alex Turner wearing a constant smirk“I just wanted to be one of the Strokes,” sings Alex Turner at the outset of the Arctic Monkeys’ sixth album. “Now look at the mess you made me make.”Certainly, he and his band seem to have traversed a far greater distance in the last 12 years than any of their peers, to the point where they seem almost unrecognisable. This is evident from the way they look – posing in snakeskin shoes and expensive overcoats they resemble characters from a film, something you could only have said of them in 2006 if it had been directed by Ken Loach – to the way they sound. There is almost nothing to connect the music on Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino with the muscled-up stadium indie rock of its 2013 predecessor AM, let alone the contents of their debut. Instead, Tranquility Base displays the same endearingly puppyish, have-you-heard-this? enthusiasm for Serge Gainsbourg’s Histoire de Melody Nelson and the Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds as the first album by Turner’s side project Last Shadow Puppets did for late 60s Scott Walker. Low-slung and agile, virtually every rhythm track and bassline here could have stepped straight off Gainsbourg’s 1970 masterpiece, while Pet Sounds is paid homage everywhere from the vocal harmonies to the forensic recreation of its sound on The World’s First Ever Monster Truck Front Flip. Their combined influence is heard not just in the sound, but in the songs, which are melodically far richer and less concerned with verses and choruses than anything Arctic Monkeys have previously produced. At their best, they’re fantastic – American Sports and Four Out of Five sound lavish and fresh, their tunes and chord sequences twisting and turning unexpectedly. At worst, uncoupling the songs from a standard structure makes them ramble, as on Batphone.Along the way, Turner has had to deal with the problem that inevitably affects artists who become hugely successful by offering up sharp-eyed vignettes of everyday life: what happens when you become, as Philip Larkin alliteratively put it, the shit in the shuttered chateau, insulated by wealth and fame from the everyday life that initially inspired you? On Tranquility Base, Turner settles on an imagistic collage approach to writing, where snatches of overheard conversation are jumbled together with snappy observations and a dash of Father John Misty-esque fourth-wall-breaking (“I want to make a simple point about peace and love but in a sexy way where it’s not obvious”). Turner is clearly a very smart guy: smart enough to treat rock-star ennui as a joke rather than a subject that’s supposed to elicit sympathy – “I’m gonna run for government,” burbles the jaded narrator of One Point Perspective, “I’m gonna form a covers band an’ all” – and smart enough to tackle the hackneyed topic of social media and its impact with real wit and originality. It’s hard to stifle a groan when it becomes clear the latter is one of Tranquility Base’s preoccupations, but Turner is both funny – “dance as if someone’s watching, because they are” – and bold enough to suggest that the face-to-face contact always promoted as the solution to social media’s remote unreality is a pretty fraught business, too: “I’m so full of shite, I need to spend less time stood in bars waffling on to strangers”.The problem is that a smart guy is sometimes all Turner seems to be. The songs can feel like less than the sum of their parts: a selection of one-liners, wry observations and knowing winks to camera that leave you struggling to work out what he’s driving at – and wondering if he knows, or cares – and to locate any real emotional connection or impact. You find yourself occasionally wishing the kid who plaintively, incisively skewered the demonisation of chavs on their debut album closer A Certain Romance would show himself again. It’s an issue compounded by Turner’s voice, which has changed a lot. The Yorkshire dialect that was once his USP is now deployed sparingly, as a jolting effect: “He’s got him sen a theme tune.” Elsewhere, his voice carries traces of Gainsbourg’s sprechgesang, and Jake Thackray’s careful enunciation and chewy vowels he regularly shifts into a mid-Atlantic easy-listening croon (“a lounge singer shimmer,” as Star Treatment has it) that seems deliberately mannered, another knowing wink to camera. It’s an odd mix that’s sometimes compelling and sometimes a bit pleased with itself, as if Turner is delivering every line through a supercilious smirk. At turns thrilling, smug, clever and oddly cold, Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino is only a qualified success there’s something quietly impressive about the fact that it exists at all, at least as an Arctic Monkeys album. The obvious, craven thing to do would have been to release it as a solo project, then make a crowd-pleasing album in AM’s vein. Instead, here it is, evidence – albeit flawed – of a certain musical restlessness: the very thing, one suspects, that’s caused the band to travel so much further than their contemporaries that they’re virtually the last indie band standing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b6f044aad0d15724c75bb81ee6453ce5dfcc2dd/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87c830ccc0836633b35d205de4012373","title":"this months best music may florence the machine paris ariana grande roisin murphy","story":"From Róisín Murphy’s erotic disco to Onyx Collective’s post-bop jazz and Deafheaven’s soulful metal, here’s our roundup of the best new music. Subscribe to the playlist of all 50 tracks and read about our 10 favouritesby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Laura SnapesWhile Florence + the Machine’s singles are never short on impact, it’s hard to remember the last one that hit as hard as Hunger, the first single from her fourth album, High As Hope. The setting is business as usual – gospel harmonies, battered piano, touches of harp – but Florence’s voice holds the centre as she sings lyrics as intimate as the music is powerful. “At 17, I started to starve myself,” she sings, and outlines the vices she used to commit to fill the void – the drugs, the love of strangers – then marvels at a figure whose ease and beauty seem to defy death. After all the drama and revelations, Hunger’s most breathtaking moment is a pause: “And for a moment, I forget to worry,” she sings as she beholds this liberated whirlwind, and the song cuts dead, dropping you off a cliff edge.Post Malone’s enormous success with his second album, Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys, this month shows that the world has a considerable appetite for white blokes with face tats moaning infectiously about how they wish they were dead. Coming through to sate them further is girlishly handsome goth rapper Paris. Lyrics such as “I keep seeing coffins  This syrup keep me coughin’” could have been made by a SoundCloud rapper lyric generator, but they’re wed to a brilliant, anthemic, tumbling chorus.Jesse Kanda is the brilliant visual artist who has created record sleeves and videos for FKA twigs, Björk and, most enduringly, Arca. His aesthetic is of bulging, mutant biomorphic humanoids, poignantly gesturing in affection, confusion or confidence despite their beastly appearance (a style shamelessly ripped off by the Horrors for their last album campaign). He releases music as Doon Kanda, and it’s no undercooked side project – the latest EP, Luna, is highly accomplished, full of eerie, awkward rap instrumentals, and Lamina’s raw organ melodies make it one of the highlights.The first track to be released from Liberation, Christina’s first album in five years, is one of the year’s best pop songs: boundary-pushing yet catchy, with a truly magical arrangement where diffuse elements cohere against the odds: rumbling bass, 80s boogie chords, a mashed MPC’s worth of simultaneous samples. Produced by Kanye West – a fact kept pretty quiet after his slavery comments last week – it shares the chaos of Life of Pablo, but soothed by Aguilera’s always-commanding vocals. She is ably aided by Ty Dolla $ign pushing his guest vocals into gorgeous hoarseness, and 2 Chainz smartly halving the tempo for his middle eight.Masterful and unique neo-soul, as LA singer Kadhja Bonet floats mesmerisingly around her higher register with psychedelic touches – wandering synths, bulbous bass squelches – sitting beneath her. After six minutes, the melody ends up twining around your bones, and the way the arrangement is written, with everything gently tugged back to Earth by a slow, boom-bap drum pattern, keeps everything in exquisite equilibrium.Given they have both been separately been ploughing a furrow of deep, smart contemporary disco-house, it’s remarkable that Róisín Murphy and Maurice Fulton haven’t worked together more – just a single remix prior to this. She is the former Moloko siren with the inimitably erotic voice he’s the producer behind everything from shouty electroclash duo Mu to bonkers boogie project Syclops to that ridiculously hot Alice Smith remix that you still hear aired today. On their new collaborative 12-inch, All My Dreams pairs filthy slap bass and giant toms with sexy pronouncements from Murphy on the way to a post-punk-disco classic, but even better is Innocence, with an acid bassline spurting between upfront deep house rhythms and funky timbales. Absolutely essential.While the hipster jazz cognoscenti are all about Kamasi Washington and Alice Coltrane-inspired cosmic vibes, it’s refreshing to hear a combo who don’t shy from traditional styles. Onyx Collective are a New York four-or-more piece who have played with people as varied as David Byrne, Princess Nokia and Blood Orange, but on their own tracks, such as FDR Drive, they skew to swinging post-bop, topped with Isaiah Barr’s melodic, Sonny Rollins-ish saxophone.Oliver Coates has played cello with Radiohead and Anna Meredith, released an album with Mica Levi (2016’s superb Remain Calm) and covered John Luther Adams’ Canticles, among his other classical pursuits. But it’s his recent solo foray into electronic music where the breadth of his unique vision comes to life: 2016’s Upstepping was as influenced by Arthur Russell as pirate radio, and going by Charlev, it looks like his second album under his own name will switch lanes again while maintaining Coates’s inventive streak. It’s an eight-and-a-half-minute journey that veers from a kind of meditative agitation with echoes of dabke music, to more corrosive depths – another smart study in contrasts.Sitting, as ever, in a gloriously personal space between double-kick-drumming black metal, heavy prog à la Motorpsycho, and My Morning Jacket-style soulful rock, Deafheaven are back with a track that has patches of hard riffing and uplifting solos, but which ties it all together in a single, overwhelming arc. Like a true metaller, you can’t really work out what George Clarke is screaming about, but the keen feeling is such that you don’t need to.In spring 2017, Melody Prochet announced her second album as Melody’s Echo Chamber, Bon Voyage. But after suffering a serious accident that left her hospitalised for several months, the release was postponed until later this year. The lyrics to its first single seem to address the arduous process of recovery and the temporary hopelessness of her situation – “It’s been so long, there must be some kind of light to come” – but the music, produced with Swedish psychedelicists Fredrik Swahn (of the Amazing) and Reine Fiske (of Dungen), is a featherlight odyssey, filled with space and intrigue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5369ab1de82c5e1fd05cae1d9ea5cec6d8c1d953/324_0_4808_2885/master/4808.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fc59f2abf5d3de650c81ed7a7b6750a","title":"the invisible power of big glasses eyewear industry essilor luxottica","story":"How one giant company will dominate the way the whole world sees. By  Sam KnightIf you have been wearing glasses for years, like me, it can be surprising to discover that you perceive the world thanks to a few giant companies that you have never heard of. Worrying about the fraying edge of motorway lights at night, or words that slide on the page, and occasionally spending a fortune at the opticians is, for many of us, enough to think about. And spectacles are unusual things. It is hard to think of another object in our society which is both a medical device that you don’t want and a fashion accessory which you do.Buying them, in my experience anyway, is a fraught, somewhat exciting exercise that starts in a darkened room, where you contemplate the blurred letters and the degeneration of your visual cortex, and ends in a bright, gallery-like space where you enjoy the spry feel of acetate in your fingers, listen to what you are told, pay more than you were expecting to, and look forward to inhabiting a new, slightly sharper version of your existing self.But what we see masks the underlying structure of the global eyewear business. Over the last generation, just two companies have risen above all the rest to dominate the industry. The lenses in my glasses – and yours too, most likely – are made by Essilor, a French multinational that controls almost half of the world’s prescription lens business and has acquired more than 250 other companies in the past 20 years.There is a good chance, meanwhile, that your frames are made by Luxottica, an Italian company with an unparalleled combination of factories, designer labels and retail outlets. Luxottica pioneered the use of luxury brands in the optical business, and one of the many powerful functions of names such as Ray-Ban (which is owned by Luxottica) or Vogue (which is owned by Luxottica) or Prada (whose glasses are made by Luxottica) or Oliver Peoples (which is owned by Luxottica) or high-street outlets such as LensCrafters, the largest optical retailer in the US (which is owned by Luxottica), or John Lewis Opticians in the UK (which is run by Luxottica), or Sunglass Hut (which is owned by Luxottica) is to make the marketplace feel more varied than it actually is.Between them, Essilor and Luxottica play a central, intimate role in the lives of a remarkable number of people. Around 1.4 billion of us rely on their products to drive to work, read on the beach, follow the whiteboard in biology lessons, type text messages to our grandchildren, land aircraft, watch old movies, write dissertations and glance across restaurants, hoping to look slightly more intelligent and interesting than we actually are. Last year, the two companies had a combined customer base that is somewhere between Apple’s and Facebook’s, but with none of the hassle and scrutiny of being as well known.The creation of EssilorLuxottica is a big deal. It will have knock-on consequences for opticians and eyewear manufacturers from Hong Kong to Peru. But it is also a response to an unprecedented moment in the story of human vision – namely, the accelerating degradation of our eyes. For several thousand years, human beings have lived in more or less advanced societies, reading, writing and doing business with one another, mostly without the aid of glasses. But that is coming to an end. No one is exactly sure what it is about early 21st-century urban living – the time we spend indoors, the screens, the colour spectrum in LED lighting, or the needs of ageing populations – but the net result is that across the world, we are becoming a species wearing lenses. The need varies depending where you go, because different populations have different genetic predispositions to poor eyesight, but it is there, and growing, and probably greater than you think. In Nigeria, around 90 million people, or half the population, are now thought to need corrective eyewear.At the same time, across the developing world, a slower and more complex process is underway, as populations age and urbanise and move indoors to work. The history of eyewear tells us that people do not, as a rule, start wearing glasses because they notice everything has gone a little out of focus. It is in order to take part in new forms of entertainment and labour. The mass market in spectacles did not emerge when they were invented, in 13th-century Italy, but 200 years later, alongside the printed word in Germany, because people wanted to read.In 2018, an estimated 2.5 billion people, mostly in India, Africa and China, are thought to need spectacles, but have no means to have their eyes tested or to buy them. “The visual ide”, as NGOs call it, is one of those vast global shortcomings that suddenly makes sense when you think about it. Across the developing world, straightforward myopia and presbyopia, the medical name for longsightedness, have been linked with everything from high road deaths to low educational achievement and poor productivity in factories. Eye-health campaigners call it the largest untreated disability in the world.It is also a staggering business opportunity. Essilor and Luxottica know this. It was Essilor that worked out and first publicised the 2.5 billion statistic, in 2012. “For 2,000 years people were living mainly outside,” said Hubert Sagnières, Essilor’s chairman and chief executive, when we met recently in Paris. “Suddenly, we live inside, and we use this.” He tapped his mobile phone on the table. The legal and technical details of the EssilorLuxottica merger will take a few years to iron out, but Sagnières was transparent about its mission: to equip the planet with eyewear over the coming decades. “I am driving a very profitable company,” Sagnières told me. “You know, between 2020 and 2050, governments will not solve all the problems of the world.”The looming power of EssilorLuxottica is the subject of morbid obsession within the eyewear world. Everyone knows the new company is poised to have a profound impact on the way that we are going to see. “Forgive me,” said one longtime entrepreneur in the sector. “But it is nothing short of control of the industry.” One investor described the new corporation as a “category killer”. In many conversations, people described its arrival, which would have been genuinely unthinkable a generation ago, as both extraordinary and somehow inevitable at the same time. That struck me as the kind of contradiction you come across more often in a person than in a business. And it is true of EssilorLuxottica and, to some extent, the business of vision itself, because it is – to an amazing degree – the legacy of a single man.Leonardo Del Vecchio is the patron, legend and haunting spirit of the global eyewear business. He is its Citizen Kane and its Captain Ahab. His father died before he was born his mother was poor and he was raised in an orphanage in wartime Milan, where he went out to work as a metal engraver at the age of 14. In 1961, Del Vecchio opened a workshop in the town of Agordo, in the Dolomite mountains. He was 25, and starting out on his own. The valley around Agordo was emptying out because of the closure of a mine, and the town was giving away land to companies that were willing to move there. Del Vecchio asked for 3,000 sq metres on the riverbank to build a factory to make parts for spectacles. He had a young family, and in time, he built a house next door to the workshop so he could step from one to the other, starting his day at 3am.Over the next half century, Del Vecchio grew his company, which was called Luxottica, into the world’s greatest maker of glasses frames. In an industry that was traditionally fragmented and small-scale, the totality of Del Vecchio’s ambition took his rivals by surprise. He sought to control every element in the business, from the metal alloys of the hinges to the stores where eyewear is sold. “Never assume that you have arrived, or look at the world as your only point of reference,” he liked to say. In a series of audacious takeovers, Del Vecchio acquired brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley and Persol, and signed contracts with fashion houses such as Armani, Ralph Lauren and Chanel. He built factories in China, acquired vision insurance schemes in the US and retail chains on four continents.Since 1994, Del Vecchio has been Italy’s highest inidual taxpayer and the country’s second-richest man. A few years ago, people thought his career had run its course. But in January 2017, at the age of 81, Del Vecchio announced the greatest deal of his life, in which he also secured the final missing part for his frames – the lenses – when Luxottica agreed to merge with Essilor. “He wants to do this merger,” a former colleague said, “thinking he will leave behind this great company that will last for 100 years.”When I arrived in Agordo one recent afternoon, it was thinking about starting to snow. The town rests among steep wooded hills and the bare grey sides of mountains. The blue buildings of the Luxottica factory, with Del Vecchio’s house still standing by the entrance, glowed across the river. Although the plant is now merely one of the company’s 12 frame manufacturing facilities, which stretch from São Paulo in Brazil to Dongguan in southern China, the founding in Agordo remains Luxottica’s organising myth. Every year, Del Vecchio hosts a Christmas dinner for the plant’s 4,500 workers (the town of Agordo has a population of 4,000), which is entertained by an Italian pop star of his choosing. “People are screaming and crying when he comes in,” said Giorgio Striano, Luxottica’s chief operating officer. In Agordo, Del Vecchio is referred to as simply, “Il Presidente”.For the company’s 30th anniversary, in 1991, Del Vecchio renovated some 15th-century stables in the middle of Agordo and opened a private glasses museum. The curator, Caterina Francavilla, who is the daughter of Del Vecchio’s longtime deputy, showed me round before she closed up for the day. The first glasses were almost certainly made in northern Italy in the last decades of the 13th century. (Lenses are called lenses because they looked like lentils.) But for centuries after their invention, spectacles and other magnifying lenses were mostly rejected by medical men, who warned of their unnaturalness and recommended potions to correct people’s eyesight instead. In The Perfect Oculist, of 1666, Robert Turner, a London doctor, recommended turtle’s blood and the powdered head of a bat for the treatment of squints. For weak eyesight, you might try wearing cow’s eyes around your neck.The cabinets in Del Vecchio’s museum traced the evolution from the leather frames and hinged bridges of the middle ages to the gold rims of the 19th century. There were opera glasses designed by Napoleon for his Polish mistress, Maria Walewska a pair of Emperor Franz Joseph’s spectacles and some pink “occhiali appartenenti a Elton John.” No one knows why it took 400 years to put the arms on glasses – which are known as temples, and were pioneered in London in the early 18th century – so they finally sat comfortably on people’s ears. To mark another historic milestone, one cabinet also held a copy of Luxottica’s slender debut catalogue, from 1971, when the company made its first complete frames.On a shelf near the door of the museum, I spotted A Man Who Sees Far, an official Luxottica biography of Del Vecchio, which was published in 1991. I expected the optical world to be genteel and polite, and was taken aback whenever conversations turned to the personal charisma, and menace, of Del Vecchio. “He’s the godfather,” said Dean Butler, who founded LensCrafters in 1983. (Del Vecchio bought it in 1995.) “The godfather, to me, is the guy. He runs it.” One former senior Luxottica executive told me: “Honestly, he kind of rules by fear.” Very few opticians would even mention Del Vecchio’s name – lending him a Voldemort-like aura – for fear of offending him, however unlikely that might be. One talked about “getting a horse’s head in the bed”. Another concluded our interview by saying: “You can quote me as long as it sounds like I am sucking Del Vecchio’s dick.”I took A Man Who Sees Far back to my hotel. Even in the company’s hagiography, Del Vecchio comes across as improbably driven and unfeeling. The biographer struggles to get a few words with Il Presidente as he crosses the tarmac to his private jet. (Del Vecchio rarely gives interviews he declined to speak to me.) “There were no kisses, no cuddles,” his eldest daughter, Marisa, recalls in the book. “Frankly, we were scared of him.”Del Vecchio built the empire of Luxottica on two ideas. The first was to do everything itself. After the company’s initial progression from parts to frames in the early 1970s, it set out, step by step, to control the entire process of making and selling glasses, from acquiring the raw materials to selling its own products in its own stores. No one had done this before Del Vecchio. “There is a simplicity to him,” one former colleague told me. “To him it is a very simple equation: I make the best stuff, why doesn’t everybody buy it?”For the first 25 years, Luxottica stayed on the wholesale side of the industry – “behind the curtain”, as it is known – selling its glasses through opticians to the public. In the 1990s, however, Del Vecchio decided he wanted a retail network too. First, he got Luxottica listed on the New York stock exchange, an almost-unheard of move for a mid-sized Italian business. “A lot of big experts said it was impossible,” said Roberto Chemello, the chief executive at the time. Luxottica later estimated the listing to have been worth around $100m in advertising in the US – and it laid the ground for Del Vecchio’s hostile takeover of US Shoe, a conglomerate that owned LensCrafters, the country’s largest optical chain, in 1995. On paper, the deal appeared outlandish. US Shoe was five times larger than Luxottica, and its board did not want to sell. Having its own shops would also put Luxottica in direct competition with the thousands of optometrists it had been supplying for decades. “You have to be not only courageous,” said Chemello, of the transaction, “but a little bit crazy.” Luxottica bought US Shoe for $1.4bn.Once the deal was done, Del Vecchio promptly broke up US Shoe, whose roots went back to 1879, until all that was left were the LensCrafters stores that he wanted in the first place, which he proceeded to fill with Luxottica frames. “That is exactly the formula they have used ever since,” said Jeff Cole, the former chief executive of Cole National Corporation, an even larger optical retailer that sold out to Luxottica in 2004. “When they buy a company, they spend a little time figuring it out and kick out all the other suppliers.”In the factory in Agordo, I saw dual-armed robots pinning together the front and temples of Ray-Ban Wayfarers, and basket after basket of metal frames being dunked in a series of chemical baths to coat and colour them. Glasses may appear to be relatively simple objects, but they involve between 180 and 230 manufacturing stages to produce. With its own designers, lasers and massive, quietly humming machines, Luxottica can take a pencil sketch to global production in about three weeks. “We are in a closed loop,” said Striano, the operations chief. Taking into account all the different colours and face shapes (Japanese noses are not the same as Latino noses), Luxottica has around 27,000 models in production at any one time. Its plants turn out 400,000 pairs of frames per day. I asked Striano if any other company came close. “I think nobody,” he said.Del Vecchio’s second great insight is the one that changed the nature of the optical business – and that was to combine it with the fashion industry. Although designers such as Pierre Cardin and Christian Dior had been experimenting with frames since the 1960s, Del Vecchio saw a way to take their ideas, and more importantly, their labels, to a mass market. In 1988, he signed a licensing deal with Giorgio Armani, another self-made tycoon, who had started out as a window-dresser at a department store in Milan. The deal transformed the glasses game. Until then, consumers in Europe and America who wanted fancy spectacles had to rely on staid, industry names such as Zeiss, Rodenstock or Silhouette. After the Armani deal, they could buy Prada, Gucci and Chanel, and they were willing to pay for it. “It created something,” as one Luxottica manager artfully told me, “to make the needs where probably they are not.”People in the industry observe that taste in frames follows a roughly 30-year cycle, from metal, to rimless, to acetate and back again, in which familiar spectacle shapes recur and then disappear. The trend right now is towards metal, and designs that last flowered in Ronald Reagan’s America. In the “Style Area” in Agordo, on the factory’s first floor, I met Mario Mollo, a senior product manager. “You see now the 80s is becoming very popular,” he said. “You see shallow, very wide.”Mollo was poring over a desk of large-scale drawings of a new acetate frame for Oliver Peoples, named “Leonardo”. Spectacle frames require a thousand barely noticeable design decisions, around the shape of the bridge, the thickness below the eyes, or the pantoscopic tilt (how the angle of the lens meets the front of your cornea). The Leonardo had an unusual temple, in which a curving piece of wire had to be sandwiched between two pieces of acetate. “Sometimes this one is not easy to find the right bending,” said Mollo, tracing his finger along the drawing. Like every other senior Luxottica figure I met in Agordo, Mollo was Italian, male, dressed in cashmere, and wearing a pair of the company’s frames. On a workbench a few feet away, there was a pair of €4,000 (£3,500) Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana sunglasses that were hand-painted in Sicily, made out of wood and looked like a carnival float. “With sun, you can go totally crazy,” said Mollo. Luxottica had made only 100 for the entire world. “Crazy,” said Mollo, “but sold out.”The transformation of glasses from a medical device to a means of self-expression, like clothes or sneakers, has been a source of joy for millions of people. But it has also obscured their original purpose, and complicated efforts to distribute them as easily as, say, mosquito nets or aspirin. When I mentioned this to Mollo, he recalled a recent trip he had taken with Luxottica’s corporate social responsibility programme, conducting eye tests and distributing glasses in rural China. “They were so happy having the possibility to see. They were hugging us. It was really not for fashion,” he said. “Then they started, you know, looking at themselves,” – Mollo paused for a second – “and the fashion moment arrived.”The fusion of the fashion industry and the optical business is now regarded as complete. Until recently, eye-health charities and campaigners used to distribute thousands of pairs of secondhand glasses from richer countries to poorer populations that lacked them. In 2011, the World Health Organization advised them to stop – in part because people were refusing to wear outdated styles. “Being poor doesn’t mean we want to look stupid, you know,” Prof Kovin Naidoo, who runs the Brien Holden Institute, one of the world’s leading eye-health NGOs, told me.My last stop in Agordo was Luxottica’s sample room, a broad, quiet, carpeted space looking out over the river. The room contains every current Luxottica design, arranged on various tables and ranked in order of sales. The system has been in place since the plant was built in 1972, and during that time, it has been the domain of Luigi Francavilla, Luxottica’s deputy chairman, who is now in his early 80s. “Glasses are beautiful,” he said, pausing among the hierarchies of Ralph Lauren, Valentino and Bulgari models. “Especially the ones that sell the most.”It was snowing outside and Francavilla was wearing a thick blue cardigan. One of the first things he did was to take my glasses off my face to identify the tortoiseshell acetate, which is known as Havana. His own glasses were a pair of rimless Ray-Bans with pink carbon-fibre temples. Luxottica bought Ray-Ban from Bausch \u0026amp Lomb, one of the 20th century’s great optical companies, in 1999. At the time, the label was washed up. You could buy a pair of Aviators at a petrol station for $19 (£14). “It was a train smash,” a former senior Luxottica executive told me. “They were selling Wayfarers at Walmart.”Del Vecchio paid $645m (£476m) for Ray-Ban. During the negotiations, he promised to protect thousands of jobs at four factories in the US and Ireland. Three months later, he closed the plants and shifted production to China and Italy. Over the next year and a half, Luxottica withdrew Ray-Ban from 13,000 retail outlets, hiked their prices and radically improved the quality: increasing the layers of lacquer on a pair of Wayfarers from two to 31. In 2004, to the disbelief of many of his subordinates, del Vecchio decided that Ray-Ban, which had been invented for American pilots in the 1930s, should branch out from sunglasses into optical lenses, too. “A lot of us were sceptical. Really? Ray. Ban. Banning rays from the sun?” the former manager said. “But he was right.”How did just two companies – one in frames, and one in lenses – come to dominate something as generic, as obvious, as glasses? It’s almost as if the world had one manufacturer for pens, and another for ink. The conditions that have allowed for the rise of Essilor and Luxottica are rooted, deep down, in the way spectacles are sold. Until the end of the 19th century, you could buy a cheap pair of glasses – for reading or for distance – out of a rack in Woolworth’s, or from a jewellery shop, or a guy in the street. Eyewear was a craft of tinkerers and inventors. “I this evening did buy me a pair of green spectacles,” Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary on Christmas Eve 1666, “to see whether they will help my eyes or no.” (They didn’t Pepys’ failing eyesight forced him to give up his journal three years later.)It was the birth of the optometry profession, around 1900, that changed things. This was a new breed of sober, respectable spectacle-sellers – not unlike pharmacists – who wanted to standardise eye tests and to restrict the sale of glasses to licensed professionals. Their aim, for the most part, was to raise standards. Eyeglass pedlars in the 18th and 19th centuries were notorious for scams and faulty lenses. But there was also another compelling reason to take a cheap, widely available product and put it in the hands of a few authorised sellers – and that was to make money.The first opticians had a tough time of it. They were disdained by ophthalmologists – proper eye doctors, who had trained in hospitals and considered themselves above the tawdry trade in glasses. The first optometry course in the US was taught at Columbia University’s physics department because it was not allowed inside the medical school. (A remnant of this prejudice still holds: within the optical industry, optometrists are always being teased for their chippiness and self-importance. “One step above dermatology,” a former Luxottica executive sniped to me).But the new professionals persevered and, in a way, the story of optometry for much of the 20th century was of finding new ways to protect their patch. Across Europe and in the US, optometry laws and regulations were passed to control the prescription and selling of eyewear. Many of these had a “doctorly” aspect, but they also had the effect of creating a highly opaque marketplace. For a long time, opticians fought all forms of advertising, for example, which might force them to spell out their prices and allow customers to shop around. In some places, this reached ridiculous extremes: in Kentucky, for a time, optometrists’ signs could not be more than four inches high. Under Britain’s Opticians Act of 1958, the display of prices was banned altogether, which meant that opticians were more or less free to make them up on the spot. “The price would come from a little black book,” one veteran practitioner told me. “There was a lot of sharp practice around.”This was when Essilor came on the scene. In 1972, Essel and Silor, two French optical companies, merged and began sell aggressively into the US market. Essilor specialised in plastic lenses, which were replacing glass, and it also had a magical product: “Varilux”, the world’s first progressive lens, invented by an Essel engineer named Bernard Maitenaz in 1959. Progressive lenses allow people who are both long- and shortsighted – typically older customers – to combine their prescriptions into a single, graduated lens. The early Varilux models were experimental and not everyone could adapt to them, but they were probably the most important innovation in eyewear since the invention of bifocals around the time of the French revolution. The company set out to make sure that Varilux and the rest of its products (Essilor’s current sales manual runs to around 400 pages) were sold in every optometrist in the world.Lenses are the pixie dust of the optical business. Barely anyone knows what they are made of, how they are constructed and, especially at the high end, exactly how they work. For the last half century, persuading opticians to prescribe Essilor, as opposed to Hoya or Zeiss, the company’s main rivals, has been painstaking, face-to-face work. One British optician, who stocks Essilor, described it to me this way: “Is there a difference between an Audi, a BMW or a Mercedes? Probably not. But you prefer that badge to that badge, or the way they win hearts and minds.” For years, the company has brought opticians to Paris and its Essilor Academy, where they are wined and dined and taught about its latest products. “It’s not really bribes it’s the way it works,” one industry veteran told me.And when all else fails, Essilor – like its rivals, and like all wholesalers – uses financial incentives to keep its customers satisfied. Opticians and industry analysts that I spoke to for this article described how Essilor uses so-called “spiff money” – offering stores large, multi-year discounts and cash bonuses for selling its products – in order to squeeze out the competition. “Essilor wants to dominate this industry worldwide,” one retailer told me. “They are actually a well run company. They are not a ruthless company. But they get away with all this crap which in any other industry would be anti-consumer.”Some opticians call Essilor “The Big E”. The company boasts of supplying between 300,000 and 400,000 stores around the world – three or four times as many as Luxottica. “The strategy has to be absolutely global,” Sagnières, the chief executive, told me. “Not just for the rich or poor.” The company has not restricted itself to lenses by any means. If Luxottica has spent the last quarter of a century buying up the most conspicuous elements of the optical business (the frames, the brands and the high-street chains) then Essilor has busied itself in the invisible parts, acquiring lens manufacturers, instrument makers, prescription labs (where glasses are put together) and the science of sight itself.The company holds more than 8,000 patents and funds university ophthalmology chairs around the world. In deals that rarely make the business pages, Essilor buys up Belgian optical laboratories, Chinese resin manufacturers, Israeli instrument makers and British e-commerce websites. You can find threads on optometrist message boards with headings like “Essilor Has Purchased and Now Owns (Insert Company Name Here)”, which attempt to record all the independent lens makers and laboratories that used to exist. Within the industry, the Big E is generally considered less rapacious than Del Vecchio’s Luxottica people regard it instead as a kind of unstoppable, enveloping tide.The companies saw themselves differently too. “I think Essilor, while not a model company by any means, has a moral purpose,” the former manager said. “With Luxottica, it’s just lip service. It is all about domination.” The most infamous Luxottica deals carried an edge of brutality. In 2001, the company clashed with Oakley, the world’s hottest make of sunglasses at the time. Luxottica had just bought Sunglass Hut, which sold a third of the US’s sunglasses, and Del Vecchio demanded that all its suppliers drop their prices. Oakley refused. In the summer of 2001, the company’s founder Jim Jannard flew to Milan to meet Del Vecchio and strike a deal. Jannard had founded Oakley out of the back of his car in 1975. According to Forbes magazine, at the end of their conversation, he said he hoped the two men would one day be friends. “We will never be friends,” Del Vecchio reportedly replied.After Oakley sued in 2001, Luxottica issued a statement “denying the allegations in Oakley’s complaint in all material respects” and the case was settled out of court. But Luxottica won the war, buying Jannard’s company for $2.1bn (£1.5bn) in 2007.By that time, Del Vecchio appeared ready to retire. In the summer of 2004, as he approached his 70th birthday, Luxottica’s founder handed over day-to-day control of the company to Andrea Guerra, a young chief executive he hired from Indesit, the Italian white goods company. Under Guerra, Luxottica rationalised its manufacturing, shifting more production to China. It also became more stable and predictable. The share price trebled. But according to several former executives who were close to Guerra, he was opposed to any deal with Essilor, seeing the company as a long-term rival. (Guerra declined to speak with me). “He did not want to merge with Essilor,” a colleague said. “He wanted to protect us in a different way.”In 2014, however, Del Vecchio came back to work. He was 79. “We were all pretty shocked,” a former senior Italian executive told me. But it became clear that Del Vecchio was worried about what would happen to Luxottica when he dies. “His most precious child is this company,” the US manager told me. Del Vecchio has six children from four marriages to three women (he remarried his second wife, Nicoletta Zampillo, in 2010) but he has always insisted they will never succeed him. According to several senior figures at Luxottica, Del Vecchio came to believe that folding Luxottica into Essilor was the best way for his work to endure, and informal talks between the two companies began.In many ways, the final chapter of Del Vecchio’s rule at Luxottica has been chaotic and disorienting. Guerra was soon forced out. After that, Del Vecchio went through four chief executives in three years. In his early 80s, he is no longer the force that he once was. Subordinates told me that Del Vecchio can no longer work a full week and sometimes loses his place in meetings, while demanding to sign off on decisions as small as the floor-plans of new Luxottica stores. Dozens of senior managers have left. “He really doesn’t trust anyone,” one told me.But throughout his shaky return, Del Vecchio kept his eyes on the prize, meeting in secret with Sagnières, the CEO and chairman of Essilor, until, by the summer of 2016, Sagnières said, “it was obvious” that the deal would go ahead. When the two men announced the formation of the combined company on 16 January last year in a call to investors, Del Vecchio’s voice came on the line. “I’m very pleased to be here with you today,” he said, “to present the achievement of a lifetime dream.”Over the coming decades, EssilorLuxottica will have the power to decide how billions of people will see, and what they can expect to pay for it. Public health systems are always likely to have more urgent problems than poor eyesight: until 2008, the World Health Organization did not measure rates of myopia and presbyopia at all. The combined company can choose to interpret its mission more or less however it wants. It could share new technologies, screen populations for eye problems and flood the world with good-quality, affordable eyewear or it could use its commercial dominance to choke supply, jack up prices and make billions. It could go either way.The bigger picture takes a moment to discern. Late last year, I visited Britain’s most important optical collection, which is kept in the basement of the College of Optometrists, a townhouse around the corner from Charing Cross Station. For the last 19 years, Neil Handley, the college’s historian, has been cataloguing 27,000 items donated by opticians and eyewear manufacturers, discovering the story of the industry as he goes along. “It’s under the radar,” he said. “It’s not something that is talked about.” When I asked Handley about the creation of EssilorLuxottica, he pointed to an old display of British spectacle parts, made by a firm called Hadley in Surrey in the 1930s. Until the 1970s, and the rise of cheap manufacturing in China, Britain used to have hundreds of frame-makers up and down the country.Today it has four.“What you are seeing is a potential monopoly, and the risk that brings,” said Handley. While it’s easy to fixate on the brands and the profits of the giants of the optical sector, the industry as a whole must expand dramatically in order to serve the world’s growing, ageing populations and increasing myopia among the young. “The danger is if their proposed answer to these problems turns out not to be the answer,” said Handley. “They have stifled all opposition, and so nobody else has the chance to come up with the right answer.” The stakes are highest in parts of the world that currently do not have anything like enough access to eyewear – what the industry calls the “white spaces” of Africa and parts of Latin America and Asia.“It is always better if there is more ersity in the market, and less dominance,” said Prof Naidoo, of the Brien Holden Institute, about the impact of the merger. “I don’t think anyone can argue with that.” In 2013, Naidoo was one of the authors on a groundbreaking paper that forecast that half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050 – almost 5 billion people. In the course of a single generation, across the world, from Inuit communities in Alaska to secondary-school students in Northern Ireland, researchers have recorded a rough doubling in the number of people who become short-sighted as children.The main reason, as far as anyone can agree, is a reduction in the time that they spend outdoors. Sunlight helps to moderate levels of dopamine, which in turn influence the development of the eye. Too much dopamine means eyeballs grow too long, and become oblong in shape, focusing light in front of the retina, rather than on it. Vision campaigners forecast that the myopia epidemic will put enormous strain on health systems across the developing world, which are already unable to equip their populations with a medical device that has been around since the Middle Ages. “We are barely managing in healthcare systems to provide eyecare,” said Naidoo. He corrected himself. “Not barely. We are not managing. Can you imagine, when those numbers are doubling and tripling, what is going to happen?”Naidoo was reluctant to criticise EssilorLuxottica, however. In part that is because Essilor is the world’s leading commercial funder of research into eye health, and a prominent force in improving access to corrective lenses. (Naidoo sits on the board of the company’s Vision Impact Institute in Paris.) Essilor’s €200m R\u0026ampD budget is three times the size of the rest of the industry combined, and it has a ision called 2.5 New Vision Generation, named for the 2.5 billion people who currently need glasses but don’t have them. The company is investing in schemes such as mobile optometry, putting eye-health workers on motorbikes in Indonesia at network of around 4,000 village-level optical stores in India door-to-door salespeople in the favelas in Brazil and working with the Liberian health system to get its products to what it calls the “base of the pyramid”. Last month, Essilor pledged to provide 200m pairs of free ophthalmic lenses to the estimated 900 million people living in the Commonwealth without access to glasses.In some of the least-served markets in the world, Essilor is more or less the only game in town. In 2016, the company opened an office in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country of 78 million people and 200 optical stores. Last year, Essilor acquired a prescription laboratory in Ethiopia, which currently has roughly one ophthalmologist for every million people. (In European countries, the ratio is about a hundred times smaller.) In places like these, all that eye-health campaigners can do is watch, and hope. “If the merged organisation decreases that investment, that will be a tragedy,” said Naidoo. “And that risk is there, you know. We can just hope that the merged organisation will see there is an opportunity to grow more, rather than less.”No one at Luxottica was willing to speak in detail about its plans for the merged company. It was a different story when I visited Essilor’s global headquarters, which is on a quiet street of apartment blocks in Charenton-le-Pont, in south-east Paris. The company’s senior executives are, as a rule, noticeably more nerdy and less well-dressed than their Italian counterparts, but they are much more comfortable in their role as titans of the global optical industry. Sagnières, the company’s 62-year-old chief executive and chairman, had the guileless glee of a high-school geography teacher whose class had just aced their exams. “I won!” he said, describing the deal with Luxottica. “Anything can happen. I won already. You won. Your kids won! Seriously, this is how it is.”Sagnières told me that the company has calculated – on the basis that a simple pair of glasses costs €5 – that the world can be supplied with eyewear for around €500m a year for the next 30 years. Just as importantly, any investment that EssilorLuxottica ploughs into the bottom end of the market is likely to pay off in the end. “We know that in three or five or 10 years, one day their life will have changed that much that they will afford to pay $50 for a better lens or $50 for branded frames,” said Sagnières. “I am fine with that.”A few days later, I visited one of Essilor’s research facilities in a former lens factory in Créteil, on the southern edge of the city. In a room full of brightly coloured furniture and signs that said things like “How can boomers enjoy their vision in all light conditions?” I met Dr Norbert Gorny, the company’s head of R\u0026ampD. Gorny is a tall, direct, German veteran of the optical scene, who explained that Essilor has spent much of the last decade expanding what it calls “the acuity corridor” on its progressive lenses, to help people read digital devices as they move around, compared to the more static way we used to read books and newspapers. But the company is increasingly keen to reach what it calls its “Next Generation Consumers” – people in the developing world who don’t wear glasses yet. Gorny called them “The Uncorrected”.“We do things for the 2.5 billion uncorrected,” he said. “But we also do things for people’s needs that are not already expressed.” During the afternoon, he showed me rooms where researchers put on motion sensors, as if they are in a Hollywood studio, to measure the depth of vision required for everyday tasks. Gorny also talked teasingly about new lenses that the company is developing with unnamed tech companies to supersede Google’s failed “Google glass” project of a decade ago. This time around, the idea is to project information from the internet – maps, messages, and Twitter, I suppose – directly on to the back of people’s eyes. “You can read easily – always sharp – information about where to go, the email that you did not want to miss,” said Gorny. “I leave it to your fantasy.”In How We Got to Now, Steven Johnson’s book about innovation, he describes the crude reading lenses of medieval Europe as the first piece of technology “since the invention of clothing in Neolithic times, that ordinary people would regularly wear on their bodies.” It was possible, listening to Gorny and thinking of the teenagers of Seoul, urbanising populations in Africa, and people walking through European cities with their eyes fixed to their phones, to imagine a point where more or less the whole of humanity is watching the world through intermediating screens on their eyes. I asked Gorny whether he thought the 21st century, with its demographic changes, myopia epidemic and urge for digital information, would bring about a second optical revolution, in the manner of Germany’s printing presses in the 15th century. Will EssilorLuxottica become the Facebook of seeing? “I don’t know whether we are starting a revolution, witnessing a major change like we witnessed 500 years ago,” Gorny said. “What I believe is we are in the right industry at the right time.”The question is whether there is anyone, beyond its shareholders, that will be able to hold EssilorLuxottica to account. I’m not sure there is. The next few years might be rocky, as the new company grapples with its size and attempts to find a new leader who can define the corporation and its ultimate goals under the fading shadow of Del Vecchio. But after that, the field is open and the fundamentals are clear.On my way back to London, Gorny gave me a lift to the station. “There is nothing close to that firepower once the combination is done,” he said. “You have the global footprint. You can play all the courts.” And I thought about how one of the telling aspects of wearing glasses is that they help you notice everything else – and for the most part, see the world as it actually is – but it is only occasionally, through a chance reflection, or when you really take a moment to stop and look, that you see what is sitting on the top of your nose.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca5e8c98a830edcbbc096198375c08fd9b8d00ad/0_0_3500_2035/master/3500.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=33fd3a8ddad522dfa56ce7cc64843a7f 1320w","title":"tories accused of subverting democracy by not tabling brexit debates","story":"Commons schedule has no timings for return of EU withdrawal bill or news of other key Brexit billsLabour has accused the government of “effectively subverting democracy” after an announcement of coming government business made no mention of any major Brexit-related legislation to be debated in the House of Commons.Announcing the Commons schedule for the next fortnight, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the house, gave no timings for the return of the EU withdrawal bill from the Lords, or any news on three other key Brexit-connected bills.The inaction will reinforce the sense of a government gridlocked over the Brexit process, with no agreement in cabinet over a future customs deal with the EU, and speculation ministers might seek to delay decisions still further.This has prompted speculation that a transition period could be extended, in part to allow more time for a new customs arrangement. On Thursday, Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former joint chief of staff, argued that this could happen, an idea immediately rejected by Downing Street.The further delays on Brexit legislation reinforces the belief that ministers hope to avoid any Commons defeats by putting off any big decisions by MPs until the government has finalised its strategy for exiting the EU.Instead of offering any progress on Brexit, the Commons timetable offers a series of general debates on subjects such as housing and homophobia. It brought accusations from Leadsom’s Labour shadow, Valerie Vaz, that the government was being cynical in trying to ward off rebellions.The EU withdrawal bill, during which the Lords have inflicted 14 defeats on the government over amendments, has its third reading in the upper house next Wednesday. However, Leadsom gave no information as to when the amendments would be considered again by MPs, when there would be a series of potentially crucial votes on areas including future trade and customs arrangements, and a final say for MPs on an eventual deal.There was also no information about progress for the trade bill and customs bill – Leadsom said this would happen “in due course” – or when a promised bill to enshrine the departure agreement in UK law would be introduced.“Can the leader confirm that the government is not being cynical and parking the trade and customs bills and the EU withdrawal bill, and introducing the legislation to enact EU law under the withdrawal and implementation bill, until after the negotiations are complete so as to avoid any rebellions?” Vaz said.“This is unprecedented, the government is effectively subverting democracy. The government has said they want to extend the session of parliament, owing to heavy legislation, and yet not tabling any important legislation.”Leadsom responded by saying that the withdrawal bill would come back to the Commons after its third reading in the Lords for the amendments to be “very closely” considered, but gave no date.She said: “Other EU Brexit bills will be coming forward in due course also. There is no hold-up. As the honourable lady and all honourable members will appreciate, there are very complex negotiations under way, and it’s right that we bring forward these bills at the appropriate time, as indeed we will do.”Speaking later, May’s spokesman said she was not concerned about running out of time for the withdrawal bill to make it through the Commons.He said: “We’ll set out the timetable for the bill in the usual way. The house was clear when it voted on the bill for the first time, and the bill left the House of Commons in such a way, as to deliver the smooth Brexit which is in the interests of all parts of the UK.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b16149e68f96c49b63fa7f9fda6403491639830b/0_565_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5628a7026d5411af513c78b65f9fba57","title":"new study suggests leprosy came from europe","story":"Skeletal analysis shows the oldest strains of the disease came from Europe, the oldest from Greater Chesterford, Essex circa 500ADLeprosy may have originated in Europe rather than Asia, according to the largest study to date on ancestral strains of the disease.The study has revealed that more leprosy strains than expected were present in medieval Europe, prompting scientists to reconsider the origins and age of the devastating disease.“For centuries there has been a question mark over where leprosy originated most assumptions believing it started in China and the Far East,” said Helen Donoghue, a co-author of the latest work and scientist at University College London. “This latest research shows all the strains of the leprosy bacterium, were in fact present in medieval Europe, which strongly suggests leprosy originated much closer to home, possibly in the far south east of Europe, or western Asia.”Leprosy is one of the oldest recorded and most stigmatised diseases in human history. It was prevalent in Europe until the 16th century and is still endemic in many countries, mainly in equatorial regions, with over 200,000 new cases reported annually.The scientists examined approximately 90 skeletons with deformations characteristic of leprosy, that were found in Europe and date to between 400 AD to 1400 AD.From the fragments they reconstructed 10 new genomes - complete genetic codes - of medieval Mycobacterium leprae, the bacteria that causes leprosy. Previously only one or two strains were known to have been circulating in medieval Europe and newly discovered ersity suggests the disease must be at least a few thousand years old.The new analysis also included the oldest known strain, extracted from skeletal remains found in Great Chesterford, Essex, and dated to between 415-545 AD. This strain was also revealed to be the same as that found in modern-day red squirrels, hinting that the disease may have been introduced to Britain through the squirrel fur trade.Professor Johannes Krause, the study’s senior author and a director at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany, said the team were now turning to even older skeletons in an attempt to corroborate written records of leprosy cases dating back 2,000 years. “Having more ancient genomes in a dating analysis will result in more accurate estimates,” he said. The findings are published in the journal PLOS Pathogens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a492aebf1a6dcb0f721373a5c82bb0757d42812/0_32_2150_1290/master/2150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7870e6213967c4a4514cf8a770d11987","title":"the answer to life the universe and everything might be 73 or 67","story":"A new estimate of the Hubble constant – the rate at which the universe is expanding – is baffling many of the finest minds in the cosmology community The latest, most precise, estimate of the universe’s current rate of expansion - a value known as the Hubble constant - comes from observations by the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, which is conducting the most detailed ever three-dimensional survey of the Milky Way.The data has allowed the rate of expansion to be pinned down to a supposed accuracy of a couple of percent. However, this newest estimate stands in stark contradiction with an independent measure of the Hubble constant based on observations of ancient light that was released shortly after the Big Bang. In short, the universe is getting bigger quicker than it should be.The mismatch is significant and problematic because the Hubble constant is widely regarded as the most fundamental number in cosmology. “The fact the universe is expanding is really one of the most powerful ways we have to determine the composition of the universe, the age of the universe and the fate of the universe,” said Professor Adam Riess, at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the latest analysis. “The Hubble constant quantifies all that into one number.”In an expanding universe, the further away a star or galaxy is, the quicker it is receding. Hubble’s constant – proposed by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s – reveals by how much. So one approach to measuring it is by observing the redshifts of bright supernovae, whose light is stretched as the very space it is travelling through expands. A challenge, though, is pinpointing the exact distance of these stars.Riess, who shared the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics for providing evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, is part of a team focussed on developing ultra-precise methods for measuring distances. The latest Gaia observations have advanced this effort by identifying dozens of new Cepheid stars, which have the special feature that their light flickers at a rate that is directly linked to their brightness at source. So through observing the pulsations of these so-called standard candles, scientists can work out their original luminosity and, therefore, how far away they and their native galaxies are.The new data puts the Hubble constant at 73, which translates to galaxies moving away from us 73km per second faster for each additional megaparsec of distance between us and them (a megaparsec is about 3.3m light-years).However, a separate estimate of Hubble comes from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background, relic radiation that allows scientists to calculate how quickly the universe was expanding 300,000 years after the big bang. “The cosmic microwave background is the light that is the furthest away from us that we can see,” said Riess. “It’s been travelling for 13.7bn years... and it’s telling us how fast the universe was expanding when the universe was a baby.”Scientists then use the cosmic equivalent of a child growth chart (a computational model that roughly describes the age and contents of the universe and the laws of physics) to predict how fast the universe should be expanding today. This gives a Hubble value of 67.Until recently, scientists had hoped that as measurements became more precise, this mismatch would narrow, but instead the difference has widened and the latest calculation gives a chance of only 1 in 7,000 of the discrepancy being down to chance. “If this continues to hold up we may be dealing with what we call new physics of the universe,” said Riess.What form might this take? One proposal is that dark energy, believed to be accelerating the expansion of the universe, is becoming more potent. Scientists are not sure why this would happen - since space is being stretched out, one might expect its strength to be diluted instead. Another possibility is that a fourth, not yet observed, variety of neutrino could have skewed calculations. Dark matter could also be to blame if it turns out to interact more with normal matter than current models predict.“I’m not in the business of ensuring that everything fits,” said Riess. “I think: ‘Ah this is very interesting’.”More prosaic explanations have also been put forward. John Peacock, professor of cosmology at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Beyond a certain level of complexity you have to be open to the possibility that there may be little assumptions that might not be quite right.”The crisis in cosmology, as it was described a meeting of the American Physical Society last month, could soon be resolved through new measurements of the Hubble constant based on gravitational wave observations by the Ligo collaboration. “Within the next five years, we’ll probably nail this,” said Peacock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/661e22d32187176e616c759fb0cb2c3f4f65d301/0_156_4674_2804/master/4674.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2bcef7735f9b168d5756706373eb716","title":"david goodall australias oldest scientist ends his own life at 104","story":"Goodall ate fish and chips and cheesecake and listened to Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony in final hoursAustralia’s oldest scientist, David Goodall, has ended his own life at a clinic in Switzerland, surrounded by family and while listening to Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.The British-born 104-year-old professor was forced to travel on a one-way ticket from his home in Western Australia to Switzerland where liberal assisted dying laws allowed him to end his life legally, in contrast to Australia where it remains forbidden.In his final hours, Goodall enjoyed his favourite dinner: fish and chips and cheesecake. And in his final minutes, he listened to Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, best known for its last movement Ode to Joy, reportedly passing away shortly after the piece of music finished.Family members were with Goodall until his death, which was preceded by formal paperwork that visibly frustrated the scientist, who said: “What are we waiting for?” He was accompanied to the clinic of the Swiss assisted dying organisation Life Circle by Dr Philip Nitschke, the founder of the Australian right-to-die group Exit International.To end his own life, Goodall had to turn a wheel that allowed a lethal infusion to flow into his bloodstream through a cannula on his arm. Nitschke said the professor did this “after answering questions which said he knew who he was, where he was and what he was about to do, and he answered these questions with great clarity.“In fact his last words were: ‘This is taking an awfully long time!’” Assisted dying, where patients take the final action to end their lives, is legal in Canada, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland and parts of the US.Goodall, a botanist and ecologist, had been campaigning for his home country Australia, where the state of Victoria is planning to legalise assisted dying for the terminally ill from 2019, to follow suit.“What I would like,” Goodall said, “is for other countries to follow Switzerland’s lead and make these facilities available to all clients, if they meet the requirements, and the requirements not just of age, but of mental capacity.”Though Goodall was not terminally ill, he had seen his eyesight and mobility deteriorate considerably in recent years and said that his life stopped being enjoyable “five or 10 years ago”.The scientist requested that his body be donated to medicine or, if that were not possible, that his ashes be scattered locally in Switzerland. He wished to have no funeral, remembrance service or ceremony, since he had “no belief in the afterlife”. Goodall flew from Perth, where his daughter, son and grandchildren also live, to France last week to see relatives before arriving at the clinic in Liestal, near Basel. His case caused controversy in Australia, with doctors in Perth at one point threatening to stop him flying to Switzerland.He spent his final full day exploring Basel University’s botanic gardens with three of his grandchildren, who said they were proud of his bravery in the face of great public attention and were glad he would die on his own terms.At his last press conference on Wednesday, Goodall was in good spirits and sang a few bars of Ode to Joy while wearing a jumper printed with the words “ageing disgracefully”.He said he would have preferred to die in Australia and previously voiced his resentment over the country’s laws. “Luckily my family who are in various parts of Europe and America have rallied round and come to see me, and I welcome the opportunity to see them, which I probably wouldn’t have had if I hadn’t pursued this Swiss option,” he told journalists.He appeared bemused by public interest in his case. “At my age, or less than my age, one wants to be free to choose the death when the death is at an appropriate time,” Goodall said.Exit International, which helped Goodall make the trip, said it was unjust that one of Australia’s “oldest and most prominent citizens should be forced to travel to the other side of the world to die with dignity”.“A peaceful, dignified death is the entitlement of all who want it,” it said on its website on Monday. “And a person should not be forced to leave home to achieve it.” However, the Australian Medical Association’s president, Dr Michael Gannon, says he was concerned that the “suicide of someone who’s aged 100” was being celebrated. “What is the age at which we no longer celebrate people continuing life?” he asked. “People like Dr Goodall make a decision based on nothing more than they’ve decided there’s nothing more to live for. I think that’s a dangerous line to cross.”“I have serious concerns about a community where we make arbitrary decisions about whose life is valuable enough to continue and whose should be ended under the law.”An honorary research associate at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Goodall produced dozens of research papers and continued to publish after his retirement. In 1979, he was editor-in-chief of the multi-volume Ecosystems of the World.He made international headlines in 2016 when he was declared unfit to be on campus. After an uproar and support from scientists globally, the decision was reversed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4128e351ce3d9b6f3cc4f44eb45d7abfe7b11391/0_100_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24fbd19dcd9111edec3956dd43f1cd86","title":"ireland pakistan first test match","story":"The day before the start of play they were still putting the finishing touches to Test cricket’s newest venue, the modest, pretty little ground at Malahide. So over the top of the pick-pack-pock-puck of the practising batsmen there was the sound of workmen hammering and drilling, fixing loudspeakers on the scaffold grandstands and new hoardings around the impermanent pavilion. Down the road a man was putting a fresh coat of paint on the railings by the station. The Irish have been waiting, working, a long time for this first Test match and want everything to go just so.“It’s been quite a while building up to this since it was announced,” said Ireland’s captain, William Porterfield. “I am sure there will be a lot of different emotions that will flow through everyone in the next 24 hours.” Mainly excitement, he said, but some anxiety, too. The pitch is green, the forecast awful and Pakistan have a formidable attack. Ireland aren’t short of first-class experience – they’ve more of that than this callow Pakistan side – but Boyd Rankin is the only man among them who has ever played a Test.So even Porterfield, 33, and Ed Joyce, 39, aren’t quite sure how they will handle it all. The team had a long chat with Marcus Trescothick after their warm-up match against Somerset to get a better idea about what to expect. “He talked about the experience of playing Test cricket and how the standard is just that little higher than county cricket, how it’s more relentless,” Porterfield said. It was nothing they had not heard before from their coach, Graham Ford, but Porterfield still found it reassuring.The captain and his team are acutely aware that they are not just representing themselves, but all the Irish cricketers before them, the men who never had the chance to play a Test. “It would be remiss if we didn’t talk about everything that has gone before us. Not only over the last five or 10 years, which everyone remembers, but about every cricketer who has ever played for Ireland. On and off the pitch, administrators and a lot of people have devoted a lot of their lives to make this happen.”Cricket has a long history in Ireland. There were playing in Phoenix Park back in 1730, and by 1860 it had become one of the most popular sports in the country. There were around 300 clubs in Ireland at that point and the national team waswere strong enough to beat MCC by an innings at Lord’s in 1858. Everything started to change when the Gaelic Athletic Association was formed in 1884, and then, at the turn of the 20th century, banned GAA members from playing or attending foreign sports.Back then, there wasn’t an Irish Cricket Union to protect or promote the sport. As a result the game, so strongly associated with England, dwindled in popularity. It became a minority sport, played in patches of Northern Ireland and middle-class areas of Dublin and Cork. The national team played annual matches against Scotland and tour games against counties and countries. They won some famous victories, against South Africa in 1904, West Indies in 1928 and 1969. But they were seen as beer matches.Even in the 1990s, when Cricket Ireland finally appointed their first full-time coach, Mike Hendrick, the game was an amateur affair, and often as not the players would have to covering their own costs. When Adrian Birrell took over as coach in 2002, he was told the boot of his company car was supposed to double up as a storeroom for the team’s kit. When Warren Deutrom became the chief executive in 2006, he was the board’s only full-time member of staff, with a part-time PA who worked four mornings a week.It is fitting that Pakistan are their opponents in this first Test, since they were the team Ireland beat in their breakthrough game, on St Patrick’s Day at the 2007 World Cup, a three-wicket victory that put them on the front pages and to the forefront of associate cricket. After that, Deutrom pushed through the modernisation of the sport. The first professional contracts followed in 2009, an interprovincial domestic competition was launched in 2013 and now, 11 years after that win in Jamaica, they are at last being allowed to play Test cricket.Porterfield played in that famous match in 2007. “It’s obviously been a long journey,” he said, “but in some ways a pretty quick journey as well.”When Porterfield started, Ireland did not even have ODI status, “now tomorrow we’re going out there and playing the first Test match for Ireland”. Along the way there has been, he said, “a long banging of the drum”. And now it’s done, there’s excitement, anxiety, and more than either of those, the gratitude. “It just culminates with us being lucky enough at the time of our careers to be able to take the pitch to play that first Test match.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8dc32016ac6377586525c736b75070d09a395a7/0_281_4743_2846/master/4743.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0e68fc24e7f51b65a3a3ca65520702f","title":"lewis hamilton zero comfortability f1 mercedes","story":"Lewis Hamilton believes he is not in a position to fight competitively for the world championship despite holding a four-point lead over his key rival, Sebastian Vettel.Preparing for the Spanish Grand Prix this weekend the Mercedes driver also criticised Formula One management for failing to consider drivers’ opinions in designing new circuits after he was disappointed by the layout for the new race in Miami next year, which was given official approval on Thursday.Hamilton took the championship lead after he inherited a win at the last round in Baku when his team-mate, Valtteri Bottas, went out with a puncture in the dying laps. It was his first victory of a season during which his team have struggled to optimise his car and tyre performance at every meeting except Australia.“I have zero comfortability. Since the last race I have not thought for one second that I am leading the world championship,” Hamilton said. “There is a long way to go. Imagine if I got excited now knowing that we still have all the problems. It doesn’t mean anything. What is important is where you are in the end.“If this weekend we happen to get on top of the issues we have with the car and start to be more consistent then I will be a lot happier because I know then I can punch either at my weight or a little bit above, but at the moment I am punching below my weight and that is not sufficient to win a world championship. We have been capitalising on circumstances like the outcome of the last race, so I will take it for now but in the long term the team cannot rely on that.”Hamilton had previously posted on social media criticising the Miami track and went further in Barcelona. “I don’t get why great golfers design golf courses but I don’t think any of the top racing drivers have ever designed a race track,” he said. “Miami is a super-cool place and I was very exited to hear about it but then I saw the layout and my reaction was: ‘Nah.’“I dread the thought of a street circuit we had like Valencia, which wasn’t great. It can be very hit and miss but maybe it will be a hit. If there is time and anyone wants to approach me or any other drivers, I am sure we can give some good insight into what the layout is like and how it could be better. I know Miami quite well and there are some better locations to put the track.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7255fb86e59e9abc21db47cdc477e4928517f61/0_5_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64753839f66b2c32396c1883136fb5df","title":"apple scraps 850m irish data centre after planning delays ireland","story":"Decision described as ‘hammer blow’ to west Ireland and comes before supreme court hearingApple is scrapping plans for an €850m (£743m) data centre in Ireland after three years of planning approval delays, the company has said.Plans for the European data centre were announced in February 2015, to be built in Athenry, County Galway, where green energy sources were available. The project was stalled by a series of planning appeals by conservationists seeking to preserve a forest.Last October, Ireland’s high court ruled that the data centre could proceed, dismissing the appellants, who took their case to the country’s supreme court.“Despite our best efforts, delays in the approval process have forced us to make other plans and we will not be able to move forward with the data centre,” Apple said in a statement before a supreme court hearing on Thursday.The world’s most valuable company announced plans for a data centre in Denmark at the same time as Athenry, which came online last year. Apple announced plans to build a second centre in Denmark in July. It said it still planned to expand its European headquarters in Co Cork.“There is no disputing that Apple’s decision is very disappointing, particularly for Athenry and the west of Ireland,” said Heather Humphreys, Ireland’s minister for business and enterprise. “These delays have, if nothing else, underlined our need to make the state’s planning and legal processes more efficient.”Paul Keane, the founder of the Facebook group Athenry for Apple, expressed anger after the decision was announced, saying it was “an absolute hammer blow to the locality and to rural Ireland”. The project would have been the biggest private investment in western Ireland and would have created about 300 construction jobs as well as 150 permanent jobs.One in every 10 jobs in the Irish economy is created by foreign multinational companies such as Apple. Significant investments such as data centres are viewed by Dublin as a means of securing multinationals’ presence in the country.The Irish government is in the process of amending planning laws to include data centres as strategic infrastructure, allowing such projects to get through the planning process much more quickly.Dublin said last month it had agreed a deal with Apple that would mean the US tech firm paying €13bn in back taxes. The repayment was ordered by the European commission, which said Apple had received favourable terms that amounted to state aid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc21f461cc39753de0d921e494779518e4e64fad/0_134_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22dc2ad995e2356be771c947356bbdd0","title":"british columbia canada human feet mystery","story":"Since 2007, 14 human feet clad in running shoes have been found on the shores of British ColumbiaBritish Columbia, Canada is known for many things: beautiful landscapes, great skiing, the 2010 Winter Olympics – and the human feet that have been washing up on its shores for the last nine years.Since 2007, 14 human feet clad in running shoes have been found on the shores of British Columbia, from Jedediah Island to Botanical Beach. So far, the provincial coroner’s office has identified eight of the 12. Of those eight, there were two pairs. The remaining lone feet, the coroner determined, belonged to men.Between 2012 and 2016, there was a four-year pause between sightings. Then on 7 February a new one washed ashore, discovered by a hiker along Vancouver Island’s Botanical Beach. Five days later, another one appeared. The coroner’s office confirmed they were a pair.After so many years, the arrival of human feet no longer provokes concern in the province. But when they first started to appear in 2007, speculation about where they came from ran rampant and pranksters even planted fake feet on the shores, just to add fuel to the fire.“We’ve had people put dog foot skeletons in runners and leave them on the beach,” Barb McLintock, who works at the coroner’s office, told the  in 2016. “And somebody even used old chicken bones.”Since the first foot was discovered, theories about the feet have been numerous and creative. In 2008, a Toronto Star article said that “speculation ranges from natural disasters, such as the tsunami of 2004, to the work of drug dealers, serial killers and human traffickers”. In 2008, the man who found the fifth foot told the  he suspected foul play: “There’s someone doing this all right. Think about it, if they tied a chain around someone’s ankle and threw them overboard, the foot would just pop off. That could explain it. Maybe they got a lot of bodies stored up in a container and they got washed out. We don’t know. There’s a lot of stuff goes on over there,” he said.But McLintock said this was not the work of a serial killer or the result of alien abductions. The coroner’s office has ruled that all of the identified iniduals committed suicide or died accidentally, most likely due to storms near the coast.After several years and a dozen cases, McLintock said their work suggests the feet are separating from the bodies during decomposition. This occurs more quickly underwater than it would on land.“The forensic anthropologists can be really sure of that because they can tell looking at the ends of the bones whether they disarticulated naturally or whether there’s any sign that any mechanical force has been applied to them, whether there’s any trauma, whether there’s any tool marks on them,” she said. “And none of them have had anything like that. All the evidence is pointed to just this natural articulation process.”But some people still have questions – for example, why did the feet only start turning up after 2007? The answer may be advancing shoe technology. More and more sports shoes are using air pockets or light foam in their designs, which “eventually allows them to be light enough to float and to wash up on shore”.The coast of British Columbia sees many of these cases because of tide and current patterns, according to McLintock. And while the odd foot pops up elsewhere in the world – for example, several have come ashore in Washington state – British Columbia remains in the spotlight. But McLintock has no doubt that this occurs worldwide, and not just on her coast.“Presumably there probably are a bunch of running shoes bouncing around out there,” she said. “But no one’s ever going to find them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/549186a268a25148f911afa7cc6caeeb15685aa0/273_0_3727_2236/master/3727.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c4a7ebc729588c207db9e004926678","title":"britain apologises for appalling treatment of abdel hakim belhaj","story":"Theresa May apologises unreservedly for UK role in rendition of Libyan, who was jailed and tortured, and his wifeTheresa May has issued an unprecedented apology for Britain’s role in the “appalling” treatment of a Libyan dissident and his wife, who were victims of a rendition operation mounted with the help of MI6.The prime minister wrote to Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, to apologise unreservedly on behalf of the government for its failings over the case and missed opportunities to end their ordeal.The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, read out May’s letter in the Commons as he announced that Boudchar, who was pregnant when the couple were kidnapped, would receive £500,000 compensation for the UK’s role in her treatment. Belhaj has neither sought, nor received, a financial settlement. Boudchar and their 13-year-old son Abderrahim travelled to London and watched from the public gallery as Wright told MPs that, after mediation, the government had reached a full and final settlement with the couple, who had withdrawn their legal claim.In her letter, May admitted the UK should have done more to reduce the risk that the couple could be mistreated, and had wrongly missed opportunities to help them once they were held in the prisons of the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi.She acknowledged that Britain should have realised sooner that its allies were involved in unacceptable practices, implying criticism of Libya for torture and the CIA’s practice of rendition.Downing Street confirmed that parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC) would have full access to all government papers on the Belhaj case for the first time for its inquiry into rendition, which is expected to report later this year. In her letter, which was handed to Belhaj in person by the British ambassador in Istanbul, May said: “It is clear that you were both subjected to appalling treatment and that you suffered greatly, not least the affront to the dignity of Mrs Boudchar who was pregnant at the time.“The UK government believes your accounts. Neither of you should have been treated in this way. The UK government’s actions contributed to your detention, rendition and suffering. “… On behalf of Her Majesty’s government I apologise unreservedly. We are profoundly sorry for the ordeal that you both suffered and our role in it. The UK government has learned many lessons from this period.”The couple have fought for compensation and an apology for more than six years after papers came to light during the Libyan revolution that revealed the role played by British intelligence officers in their kidnapping.They were seized in Thailand in 2004 before being hooded, shackled and flown to one of Gaddafi’s prisons, where Belhaj was tortured and sentenced to death. He was released six years later. Boudchar was four and a half months pregnant when she was abducted. She was released shortly before giving birth.Abdel Hakim Belhaj\u0026nbspand his wife, Fatima Boudchar,\u0026nbspwere the victims of a so-called rendition operation mounted with the help of\u0026nbspMI6.They have battled for compensation and an apology for more than six years, after papers that came to light during the Libyan revolution revealed the role that British intelligence officers played in their 2004 kidnap in Thailand.The couple were hooded and shackled and flown to one of Muammar Gaddafi’s prisons, where Belhaj was tortured and sentenced to death.They had sued the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, and Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, as well as the agency itself and the Foreign Office.\u0026nbspAmong the evidence obtained by Scotland Yard was a faxed letter from Allen to Gaddafi’s intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa, in which he made clear that MI6 had tipped off the Libyans about the couple’s whereabouts.Boudchar was four and a half months pregnant at the time that she was kidnapped. She was set free shortly before giving birth.Two weeks after the couple were renditioned to Libya,\u0026nbspTony Blair paid his first visit\u0026nbspto the country, embracing Gaddafi and declaring that Libya had recognised “a common cause, with us, in the fight against al-Qaida extremism and terrorism”.\u0026nbspOther documents discovered during the Libyan revolution\u0026nbspmake clear that information extracted from Belhaj was used to justify the detention in Britain of members of his Islamist opposition group, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, some of whom had settled in the UK as refugees many years earlier.After receiving the letter, Belhaj told the : “The wording of the apology was heartfelt. There was a feeling of concern, an admission of the shortcomings, an expression of unreserved apology, lessons learned, admission of failings and an expression of disappointment towards the international partners that I was handed over to. “All of these sentiments that came through in the apology, I welcome them. This is in spite of my belief that the length of time is part of the suffering. That is because you feel that you suffered and endured and were wronged, and then you have to wait for years. But what matters is the result in the end.” He said the responses of MPs was like a balm, and he felt some realised the need for laws to prevent it happening again.“From the very first moment, I insisted that there must be an apology. I never asked for monetary compensation because I don’t want to impose on the taxpayers, and so I can put a quick end to this suffering, but what led us to the courts is the rejection of the demand for an apology. I welcome this step, the acceptance of the apology condition, and I hope this is not repeated with someone else.” Boudchar said after the attorney general’s statement: “I thank the British government for its apology and for inviting me and my son to the UK to hear it. I accept the government’s apology.”Wright told MPs: “There remains a considerable international threat to the UK and our allies and it is important that government and the security and intelligence agencies are able to respond properly so we can keep our country safe.“But it is also important that we should act in line with our values and in accordance with the rule of law. That means that when we get things wrong it is right and just that we should acknowledge it, compensate those affected and learn lessons. I believe this is such a case.”By the beginning of last year, the government had spent £750,000 defending the claim. Wright said no admission of liability had been made by any defendants, which include the former foreign secretary Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, as well as the government. Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time of the rendition operations, told MPs in 2005 that suggestions the UK was involved in such abuses were “conspiracy theories” and there was no truth in the claims.When documents emerged during the 2011 Libyan revolution showing MI6 had been involved in the kidnap of two of Gaddafi’s opponents, their wives and children, Straw insisted he had not been involved in any wrongdoing. Allen has also maintained his innocence.In a statement issued on Thursday, Straw said he had been responsible for authorising actions to protect national security, including sharing information with foreign governments. Usually, he said, requests such as those for rendition were put in writing and agreed in writing. On this occasion, he had given oral approval, which was permitted in rare cases of great urgency. “I took these responsibilities very seriously. As I have said on many occasions I sought to act at all times in a manner which was fully consistent with my legal duties, and with national and international law.” Tony Blair was criticised in the Commons for his government’s role in rendition, with Joanna Cherry, the SNP’s justice spokeswoman, asking whether the case revealed part of the “dark side” of his deal in the desert with Gaddafi in 2004, and the Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh calling on him to apologise. Ken Clarke, the Conservative chairman of the all-party group on extraordinary rendition, said: “Given the fulsome nature of the apology, the question has to be asked why it has taken the government so long to settle this matter, particularly when Mr Belhaj offered to settle the case in 2013 for £3 and an apology? The delay is deeply regrettable.”Fellow Tory Andrew Mitchell called for the UK government to pass on details of the Belhaj apology to US officials examining the conduct of Gina Haspel, who is expected to be confirmed as the next director of the CIA. David Cameron announced in 2010 that there would be an independent inquiry into allegations of UK involvement in rendition and torture. A damning report was quietly published three years later, just as a jury was reaching its verdict in the Lee Rigby trial. Ministers then handed responsibility for the questions the judge-led inquiry had been unable to answer to the ISC.Sapna Malik, from the law firm Leigh Day which represented Belhaj and Bouchar, said: “Today’s candid apology from the government helps restore the humanity and dignity so brutally denied to my clients during their ordeal, and is warmly welcomed.”Cori Crider, the lawyer representing the Belhaj family on behalf of the human rights organisation Reprieve, said the extent of the government’s apology was unprecedented. “It’s broader and deeper and more sincere than any apology we have seen from the war on terror,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3490885.1525971310!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pause all letters cervicalcheck briefing memo to hse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tColoured scanning electron micrograph  of a cell of a cervical carcinoma. File photograph: Getty ImagesAttached is the briefing memo referenced earlier at the Committee meeting by the Director General.The briefing comprised three iterations of a memo which evolved from March to July 2016 and need to be read together.The briefing memo prepared by John Gleeson, CervicalCheck programme manager, is the most up to date memo and as such is the memo referred to by the Director General at the meeting today.CervicalCheck - update on cervical cancer clinical audit processinternationally recognised that cervical screening will not prevent all cervical cancers, even in previously screened women.Although a cervical clinical cancer audit process is not a mandatory requirement of a cervical screening programme and is not undertaken by all programmes, CervicalCheck decided in 2010 to initiate an audit process following the example set by programmes in the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Ongoing cervical clinical cancer audit is a resource-intensive process. Since 2010 the process has been in development and continues to evolve. The value of an audit process of this nature is that it can identify areas when screening procedures, in any aspect of a programme, could be improved. It can provide information to women about why their cancers were not prevented and information onthe effectiveness and limitations of screening.Over 1,200 cases of cervical cancer have been notified to date (start of July 2016) to CervicalCheck related to the almost 8 year period of CervicalCheck operation. This is a subset of all cases of cervical cancer in that time. These cases have been logged as part of the audit process and have been categorised and classified following a defined system as outlined in the CervicalCheck “Clinical audit process for incident cases of invasive cervical cancer”.Where a case is reviewed, the review findings are recorded. In February 2016, the Programme commenced the formal step of communicating cytology review findings arising from the clinical audit to the treating clinicians looking after inidual women diagnosed with cervical cancer.To date, a total of 86 letters have been issued to treating clinicians for cases where cytology was reviewed and a further approximately 200 letters will issue during JulyAugust 2016 where cytology was reviewed. This will complete the communication of all historic cases for the early years of the screening programme (September 2008 – 2014) in addition to recent cases (2015 – 2016) as the review findings become available. Given the volume of letters that will be issuing over the coming weeks, it is possible that inidual cases could appear in the public domain. From September 2016, letters communicating cytology review findings are likely to issue at the rate of 4 – 6 per month.All international screening programmes will have encountered a media headline that ‘screening did not diagnose my cancer’. The CervicalCheck Programme has prepared communications materials to ensure transparent, effective and robust communications processes are in place so as to provide clear information for the media and the public where appropriate on the CervicalCheck Clinical audit process and results.Another issue is that key stakeholders such as the contracted cytology laboratories have reacted with concern in some instances to the CervicalCheck Programme communicating cytology review findings to treating clinicians and there has been legal correspondence in previous months. The NSS met with one of the laboratories in May 2016 and legal correspondence has ceased since that meeting. Discussion and engagement with senior personnel in both contracted cytology laboratories, and with the clinical and administrative leads in colposcopy services, are continuing as part of the ongoing process.A ‘communications protocol’ has been prepared for consulting clinicians to address their questions.The spokesperson on matters related to this audit is Dr Grainne Flannelly, Clinical Director, CervicalCheck Programme.The effectiveness of the CervicalCheck programmeThere is a natural tendency in considering the outcomes of a cancer audit process to focus on cancers which were not prevented. This needs to be balanced by the cancers which are being prevented.Each year, around 250,000 women have a cervical screening test with CervicalCheck. The millionth inidual woman was screened in July 2015 and the number of cervical screening tests carried out since the CervicalCheck Programme began almost eight years ago exceeds two million.The majority of women within the screening age range of 25 to 60 years in Ireland are familiar with and have participated in the CervicalCheck cervical screening programme (2015 study).Each year, over 11,000 women are referred to colposcopy following an abnormal screening test result for investigation, diagnosis and treatment where necessary. Waiting times for appointments in colposcopy services and treatment have reduced dramatically since CervicalCheck was introduced.Now, women with high-grade abnormalities receive an appointment within 4 weeks, while those with low-grade abnormalities are seen within 8 weeks. Over 40,000 cases of high-grade cervical abnormalities (pre-cancer) have been detected and treated since the CervicalCheck Programme commenced (December 2015).The outcomes of the audit process to date show that while the majority of cancers were detected as early as possible through cervical screening, not all cancers were prevented. The audit process has served to identify potential improvements in a number of areas that could benefit women who participate in the CervicalCheck screening programme. Changes to the Programme that are directly or indirectly attributable to the cancer audit process include:• Introduction of HPV testing in colposcopy services for the management of women post treatment and untreated women with persistent low grade abnormalities• Changes made to the programme failsafe process to follow up abnormal results• Changes made to the discharge protocols in colposcopy services• Laboratories required to make digital images of all cancer cases• Monitoring of subsequent treatment andor biopsy of women referred to colposcopy• Establishment of formal links for statistical reporting with the National Cancer Registry, Ireland (NCRI).Work has commenced with the NCRI, who record all cases of cervical cancer, to correlate the incidence, mortality and survival rates for cervical cancer with the introduction and operation of cervical screening through the CervicalCheck Programme.Prepared by John Gleeson, CervicalCheck Programme Manager, National Screening ServiceHealth and Wellbeing DivisionNational Director, Health and WellbeingCervicalCheck - update on cervical cancer clinical audit processAlthough a cervical clinical cancer audit process is not a mandatory requirement of a cervical screening programme and is not undertaken by all programmes, CervicalCheck decided in 2010 to initiate an audit process following the example set by programmes in the UK, Norway, Sweden and Finland.Ongoing cervical clinical cancer audit is a resource-intensive process.

A cervical clinical cancer audit process is not a mandatory requirement of a cervical screening programme and is not undertaken by all programmes. CervicalCheck decided in 2010 to initiate an audit process following the standard set by programmes in Norway, Sweden and Finland.Ongoing cervical clinical cancer audit is a complex, multi-layered, resource-intensive process.

The value of an audit process of this nature is that is can identify areas when screening procedures, in any aspect of a programme, could be improved. It can provide information to women about why their cancers were not prevented and information on the effectiveness and limitations of screening. Overall it can demonstrate the importance of quality assurance guidelines. It is designed to deliver learning at a population level for the future.At this time the process is approaching the stage of communicating inidual case reports arising from the clinical audit with the clinicians looking after inidual women diagnosed with cervical cancer.There is always the risk that in communicating inidual case reports to clinicians of an inidual patient reacting by contacting the media if they feel that ‘screening did not diagnose my cancer’.This is a risk that is inherent in having a clinical audit process as part of the national programme. The clinical audit process will continue to generate case reports from hereon.The specific issue is that there is now a batchaccumulation of clinical audit case reports that have been completed. The volume element of letters increases the risk of an inidual reacting to the content ifwhen shared by their attending clinician. It is far from certain that this would happen.All international screening programmes will have encountered a media headline that ‘screening did not diagnose my cancer’.Most importantly during the conduct of the clinical audit to date no systematic quality problem of concern has been identified.One of the cytology laboratory providers has sought legal advice into the right of the programme to communicate audit outcomes. The programme is liaising with legal team on this. This is not an impediment to moving forward with formal communication of audit outcomes.The legal team are currently reviewing the content of case reports to be communicated and will advise on same.Patients always have the right to seek legal advice. CervicalCheck has always supplied information to patients’ legal representatives as and when requested since the outset of the programme in 2008.• Pause all letters• Await advice of solicitors• Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks• Continue to prepare reactive communications response for a media headline that ‘screening did not diagnose my cancer’."},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg   May 9, 2018TV presenter moves to clarify controversial remarks made on his Sunday programme "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3489628.1525897181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach defends lack of communication with theresa may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with British prime minister Theresa May over the past six weeks. Photograph: ReutersYves Herman Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with the British prime minister Theresa May for the past six weeks, despite the ongoing Brexit crisis and the suspended Belfast institutions.Mr Varadkar said that he and Ms May had each other’s mobile numbers and could contact each other whenever they needed to. “Currently the focus is on negotiations in Brussels and on the various cabinet meetings that are happening in the UK to determine what its position will be on the customs union, or a customs union partnership, and how that position might evolve,” he said.A meeting “is under consideration for next week” if they are both in Sofia, Bulgaria at the same time. But “the most useful conversation is the one which will be had once the British government has decided its position on the new customs arrangement”. Until then “it is very hard to make any particular progress at the moment”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who raised the issue in the Dáil, believed it was probably the only time in the past quarter of a century that leaders on both sides went so long without speaking, particularly during such a period of crisis.He expressed concern at the lack of communication, saying that the absence of the anti-Brexit majority in the North from any major discussions “causes damage every day”.And he said it was very surprising given the threat posed by an absent Northern Executive, and by the British government’s refusal to establish consultation processes with Dublin over the suspension, that the Taoiseach had had no contact with Ms May.Mr Martin, a former minister for foreign affairs, said the British-Irish intergovernmental conference should have been convened by now and the maximum use of the Belfast Agreement was imperative.“Otherwise, elements of the agreement can fall into abeyance and that ultimately brings the agreement itself into disrepute,” he warned.His call was echoed by Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald who said that while it was “no silver bullet”, a forum was needed to provide a roadmap.Green party Eamon Ryan said the lack of contact for six weeks was “remarkable” and he called on the Taoiseach to engage with the smaller parties including his own colleagues in the North. “Relying on the big two” – the DUP and Sinn Féin – “is not clever at this time”, Mr Ryan said.The Taoiseach said there was a lot of contact at official and political levels. He told Mr Ryan he welcomed forces in the North other than unionist or nationalist but said they had to have regard to parties’ mandate when organising meetings.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3491115.1525983492!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"time to prepare for brace yourself brexit green leader says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen party leader Eamon Ryan said it was time to look at the ‘emergency, brace yourself, we are about to crash’ Brexit scenario.

This included financial and banking, his areas of responsibility, and they had “much work done” on a scenario where the UK crashed out.Mr Ryan said the British government seemed “completely incapable of addressing the challenge”. He asked if Mr Donohoe and British chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond had started working on plans for the “absolute economic carnage” arising from a no-deal Brexit.He said it was “time that the Government and all the parties sat down about this, perhaps in private as some of these matters are difficult to discuss publicly”.Mr Donohoe said he would speak to Tánaiste Simon Coveney about how details of the planning could be shared and that there had already been sessions with stakeholders including political parties.He pointed out that Mr Coveney was in London on Thursday meeting Mr Hammond and cabinet office minister David Lidington to review where negotiations stand and to again articulate Ireland interests.Mr Coveney’s spokesman said the Tánaiste was “frank, consistent and clear” in setting out the Government’s view that there needed to be progress by the next EU summit at the end of June on a legally operable text on the “backstop” option that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland. Mr Ryan said he agreed with the strategy of “holding to no hard border but I am concerned that we are putting ourselves at the epicentre of a bigger problem”, that the British government could not agree on anything about the future relationship of the UK and Europe.He said the “Tories want to have their cake and eat it but will not now be able to get it”.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

Vaccines have been stockpiled, we have built research and monitoring capacity, and the Rapid Support Team of health experts stand ready to be deployed if needed.Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: It’s vital the global response to this outbreak is swift. We must ensure the very best protection for the communities at risk and for the health workers working to protect lives – now and for future outbreaks.Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general, emergency preparedness and response, welcomed the UK support.“The first step in containing this outbreak is to understand the extent of transmission, ensure care for people infected, engage communities and trace contacts. The generous support from Wellcome and partners like DFID in combination with WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies is already making a difference.”A team of experts from the WHO, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), and Equateur province travelled to Bikoro on Tuesday to beef up coordination and carry out investigations.WHO released $1 million (£738,200) from an emergency contingency fund, has set up a coordination group and deployed more than 50 experts to work with the DRC government and health agencies. MSF, which has worked with the Congolese authorities in the past to bring Ebola outbreaks under control, has deployed a team to help with the response.Julien Raickman, MSF head of mission in DRC, said: “At the moment there is an experienced MSF team in Bikoro, made up of medics, water and sanitation experts, health promoters, logisticians and an epidemiologist. The team is working with the national authorities and other international organisations to assess the situation and to ensure that the outbreak is contained.”In December 2016, trials of an Ebola vaccine confirmed it provides a high level of protection against a strain of the deadly disease.The outbreak occurred in Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumba.Are we prepared for the next Ebola-scale epidemic?All the cases were reported from a clinic at Ilkoko Iponge, located about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from Bikoro, where treatment capacities are limited, the WHO said.Ebola is one of the world\u0027s most notorious diseases, being both highly infectious and extremely lethal.It is caused by a virus that has a natural reservoir in the bat, which does not itself fall ill, but can pass the microbe on to humans who hunt it for bushmeat.The virus is handed on through contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. After an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat.That is often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.It is DRC\u0027s ninth known outbreak of the disease since 1976, when it was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Emmanuel Macron \u0026#39planning James Bond cigarette lighter\u0026#39 as wedding gift for non-smoker Prince HarryMay is \u0026#39weak\u0026#39 and Boris has a \u0026#39Trump hairstyle\u0026#39 - Germany\u0026#39s most senior EU official mocks British cabinet isionsVictory for dog trainer sued for failing to tame terrier as judge rules she\u0026#39s \u0026#39not dealing with a machine, but a puppy\u0026#39More bright Scottish 17-year-olds to be fast-tracked to universityNarendra Modi accused of \u0026#39selling off\u0026#39 India\u0026#39s national monumentsUS soldier has new ear grown in her armHead of NHS calls for Facebook clampdown for childhood obesityTroops from Prince Harry\u0026#39s former base rehearse for Royal weddingMonica Lewinsky disinvited from Philanthropy Summit because Bill Clinton was goingComment: There\u0026#39s almost nothing children won\u0026#39t do for a fistful of sugar Gardener \u0026#39using mobile phone while on lawn-mower\u0026#39 thought to be first person charged with the offenceEducation under attack - fighting to learn in West MosulComment: Russia, Israel and Iran are trapped in a deadly dance for the future of the Middle EastScottish Government accused of \u0026#39Alice in Wonderland\u0026#39 approach to frackingJunk mail deluge: Government urged to change law to protect households  Madame Tussaud\u0026#39s swaps wax for silicon as it unveils first intelligent robot Comment: Why are the 1980s seen as a cultural wasteland?

Unfortunately, the number of drivers still opting to ignore the law is scarily high.”Emmanuel Macron \u0026#39planning James Bond cigarette lighter\u0026#39 as wedding gift for non-smoker Prince HarryMay is \u0026#39weak\u0026#39 and Boris has a \u0026#39Trump hairstyle\u0026#39 - Germany\u0026#39s most senior EU official mocks British cabinet isionsVictory for dog trainer sued for failing to tame terrier as judge rules she\u0026#39s \u0026#39not dealing with a machine, but a puppy\u0026#39More bright Scottish 17-year-olds to be fast-tracked to universityNarendra Modi accused of \u0026#39selling off\u0026#39 India\u0026#39s national monumentsUS soldier has new ear grown in her armHead of NHS calls for Facebook clampdown for childhood obesityTroops from Prince Harry\u0026#39s former base rehearse for Royal weddingMonica Lewinsky disinvited from Philanthropy Summit because Bill Clinton was goingComment: There\u0026#39s almost nothing children won\u0026#39t do for a fistful of sugar UK joins Ebola fightback as four more cases are reported Education under attack - fighting to learn in West MosulComment: Russia, Israel and Iran are trapped in a deadly dance for the future of the Middle EastScottish Government accused of \u0026#39Alice in Wonderland\u0026#39 approach to frackingJunk mail deluge: Government urged to change law to protect households  Madame Tussaud\u0026#39s swaps wax for silicon as it unveils first intelligent robot Comment: Why are the 1980s seen as a cultural wasteland?

I was examined by a doctor but she didn\u0027t say anything to me.They were checking for the baby\u0027s heartbeat and it had plummeted and that\u0027s when I was told it was going to come out.\u0027I remember them saying I was 2-3cm dilated and I was told to push. Nobody said I was not having a c-section and doing something else instead. Whilst this was going on I was in pain.The only pain relief I was given was a spray on my tongue. I was told it was meant to loosen my cervix but I was not given gas and air - I was in pain..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}I said to them \u0026#x27it doesn\u0026#x27t feel right, stop it, what\u0026#x27s going on, I don\u0026#x27t want to do it\u0026#x27, but nobody responded to me in any wayPatient AI tried to get off the bed but they pulled me back three times and just said they had to get the baby out. They twice tried to cut my cervix and nobody told me they were going to do it. There was no anaesthetic.I said to them \u0027it doesn\u0027t feel right, stop it, what\u0027s going on, I don\u0027t want to do it\u0027 but nobody responded to me in any way.Afterwards I was in a cubicle with a curtain around me and the sister came over to me and told me my son had passed away. I didn\u0027t know the details but Dr Laxman came to see me and the baby\u0027s father was there.Dr Laxman sat on the side of my bed and she said how sorry she was for what happened but I didn\u0027t know the full extent of what happened at that point.I just said, \u0027It\u0027s alright, these things happen, I forgive you\u0027. She went away but I started screaming when I found out the full extent - I was just crying. I was upset because of the severity of his injury.I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible.Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.Midwife Mona Chard said: I was aware she had palpable tightening and some bleeding and she was moved to the labour suite. There was a lot of discussion but I\u0027m not sure who was talking to who.I can\u0027t remember Dr Laxman having a conversation with a patient. I was trying to reassure the patient and comfort her. I remember looking round and people were shocked.The doctor came over to me and said Dr Laxman had decided there wasn\u0027t going to be a C section and I saw her pull the baby\u0027s feet and cord and she told the patient to push.That is something you cannot forget and Patient A was very distressed.The hearing was told the woman was given cocodamol before she was examined and Dr Laxman decided on a standard delivery.Lawyer for the General Medical Council Charles Garside QC said: They tried to coerce the birth through traction as the baby was coming feet first followed by the lower abdomen, upper abdomen and head.However, there was an obstruction during the birth which proved to be fatal. Dr Laxman allegedly delivered the legs, torso and arms successfully but whilst trying to deliver the head, it got stuck in the cervix.The attempt to manipulate the baby\u0027s head to come out of the cervix failed because the cervix had clamped onto the baby\u0027s head and despite effort made to assist, these efforts failed..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}New babies are fragile, but this tiny baby was more fragile, and being pulled or twisted could do a lot more damageLawyer for the General Medical Council Charles Garside QCMr Garside added: At no stage was Patient A given any pain relief or instructed on when the c-section was being carried out. At no point did she try to comfort or consolidate or explain to Patient A what was going on.She failed to perform a Caesarean without general anaesthetic at a time when speed was needed. They should have carried out a category 1 Caesarean section.New babies are fragile, but this tiny baby was more fragile, and being pulled or twisted could do a lot more damage.Laxman, who faces being struck off, denies contributing to the death of her baby.Her lawyer Gerard Boyle QC addressed the mother during the hearing and told her: Dr Laxman has asked me to say she is so very sorry and deeply saddened for the outcome of your baby.She knows that no amount of words can or will soften your pain but she is hoping that knowing that what she was trying to do was her very best to deliver your baby quickly and sufficiently and she had best intentions at heart.She did not intend to harm you or harm your baby and she offers her apologies in every possible way. She hopes at some point in time that will make you feel in a way, slightly better.Emmanuel Macron \u0026#39planning James Bond cigarette lighter\u0026#39 as wedding gift for non-smoker Prince HarryMay is \u0026#39weak\u0026#39 and Boris has a \u0026#39Trump hairstyle\u0026#39 - Germany\u0026#39s most senior EU official mocks British cabinet isionsVictory for dog trainer sued for failing to tame terrier as judge rules she\u0026#39s \u0026#39not dealing with a machine, but a puppy\u0026#39More bright Scottish 17-year-olds to be fast-tracked to universityNarendra Modi accused of \u0026#39selling off\u0026#39 India\u0026#39s national monumentsUS soldier has new ear grown in her armHead of NHS calls for Facebook clampdown for childhood obesityTroops from Prince Harry\u0026#39s former base rehearse for Royal weddingMonica Lewinsky disinvited from Philanthropy Summit because Bill Clinton was goingComment: There\u0026#39s almost nothing children won\u0026#39t do for a fistful of sugar UK joins Ebola fightback as four more cases are reported Gardener \u0026#39using mobile phone while on lawn-mower\u0026#39 thought to be first person charged with the offenceEducation under attack - fighting to learn in West MosulComment: Russia, Israel and Iran are trapped in a deadly dance for the future of the Middle EastScottish Government accused of \u0026#39Alice in Wonderland\u0026#39 approach to frackingJunk mail deluge: Government urged to change law to protect households  Madame Tussaud\u0026#39s swaps wax for silicon as it unveils first intelligent robot Comment: Why are the 1980s seen as a cultural wasteland?

The series follows Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s.It’s perhaps the archetypal image of the cult we’ve come to recognise: the followers of Rajneesh, who died in 1990, dressed in orange their leader was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities) the disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead, lost contact with their families.But cults don’t have to follow the pattern of Rajneeshpuram, as the Oregon ranch was renamed, or the bloodbaths at Jonestown or Waco, where David Koresh’s sect the Branch Davidians was raided by the FBI in 1993. More often than not, they are more mundane than that… but no less damaging.Rajneesh, also known as Osho, with his ‘Orange People’ followers (Netflix)Katy Morgan-Davies last month published a book about her experiences living in Brixton with the cult leader – and her father – Aravindan Balakrishnan, who was jailed on charges of rape and imprisonment in 2015. Morgan-Davies managed to flee the cult in 2013 after 30 years – her entire life.Cults are back in the news again, but for Ian Haworth they never went away. As the head of the UK-based Cult Information Centre, he spends his life collating information on cults, offering advice and help to those who have escaped – or wish to – and campaigns for stricter legislation to control the reach and influence of these malign groups.“I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults,” says Haworth. “That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thing.”Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan (PA)That interest comes in peaks and troughs, naturally, with particular focus at the moment thanks to Wild Wild Country and Morgan-Davies’ memoir. Haworth says: “I suppose the biggest peak we’ve had began on 1 January 1999, when there was a huge amount of cult activity related to the millennium, when all kinds of things were promised or predicted. Of course, mathematically, the millennium ended at the end of the year 2000, not the end of 1999, but cult leaders don’t really care about such things. They care about money, and controlling people, and power.”Born in Lancashire, the son of a farmer, Haworth emigrated to Canada in 1972 while in his twenties. By 1978 he was working as a communications consultant for a large company, and had never given a thought to cults. Aged 31, he happened to be stopped by a woman with a clipboard in a Toronto street.After fleeing a cult in 1978, Ian Haworth has dedicated his life to helping others in the same situation (Cult Information Centre)“She was very attractive and I was very single,” remembers Haworth. “When she asked me if I had time to answer a few questions for what I thought was market research, I said yes.”But after only half a dozen questions, the tone of the exchange altered. The woman told Haworth that his answers indicated he’d fit in very well with a group she was involved with, and that it would enable him to give something back to society rather than just taking. A meeting was taking place the following week and Haworth was invited along.“I turned up and there were about a hundred people there,” he says. “A woman was talking about her addiction to alcohol and drugs, and how this group had helped her. I was planning to sneak away at the end, because I’d been brought up to be polite and didn’t want to just walk out. Then they brought out drinks and cakes, and as I’d paid $2 (£1.50) to attend I decided I might as well get my money’s worth before leaving.”The world of Cults: in picturesThe world of Cults: in picturesAravindan Balakrishnan, known as ‘Comrade Bala’ within the women-only collective he founded 40 years ago, carried out a brutal campaign of sexual degradation against the women over several decades.

He claimed that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 space shuttle disaster and Jackie, an invisible war machine, was responsible for the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader. PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Jim Jones, founder of the Peoples Temple sect in Jonestown, north Guyana, in 1978. Believers of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ followed Reverend Jones to Guyana in the Seventies, hoping to create a utopia in the jungle. Jonestown was envisaged as a “rainbow family” of all ages and races, the preacher had promised them: “Divine principles. Total equality. A society where people own all things in common, where there is no rich or poor, where there are no races.” APwords by Adam LusherReverend Jones wanted to create a glorious sacrifice, a defiant act of “revolutionary suicide” that would echo through history. Some disciples willingly colluded, cheering as he exhorted them to kill themselves and their children. But the bodies found with bent needles in their arms testified to the fact that some refused and were forcibly injected. Rexwords by Adam LusherWhen they finally counted the bodies after what would become known as the Jonestown massacre of 18 November 1978, the total came to 918, of whom 304 were children.

Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities). His disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead and lost contact with their families.During a break he went into the corridor for a cigarette, and that’s when the cult members pounced. Haworth had seen his doctor not long before and been told if he carried on smoking like he did he’d be lucky to see 40. The group told him that they would absolutely guarantee he would stop smoking if he attended a further course for $220. He’d already looked into smoking-cessation courses that were of comparable cost, so decided he’d give this one a go.“The course took place in September, 1978,” says Haworth. “By the end of the course I’d given notice at my job, promised to dedicate my life to the cult, and handed over all my savings, which amounted to about $1,500.”Jonestown commune mass suicide in 1978 (AP)Even now, Haworth cannot identify the tipping point that turned him from someone who’d turned up for a meeting at the behest of an attractive woman to someone who gave himself, body and soul, to a cult, other than mid-way through the course when he stopped smoking. “I suppose that was the moment I went over to them – they had done what they said they would do.”Cults often thrive on feeding into people’s desires. Sometimes they will promise success, artistic or creative talent, fulfil a desire in their targets to effect social change or, as with Haworth, to “give something back” to the world. They will promise freedom from addictions or improved physical or mental health. They’re what Haworth calls therapy cults, as opposed to the religious cults that offer more spiritual promises.If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had. You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situationOver the next month, Haworth tried to recruit his friends and even neighbours to the group. They were appalled at the change in him, but, he says, “I thought they were wrong, I knew they weren’t part of the elite, like I was.”It was an almost textbook recruitment, and Haworth firmly believes he would have been lost to everyone who knew him but for one error on the part of the cult. “Most cults programme their members against the media very early on. These people didn’t do that,” he says. And that was what saved him.A neighbour gave him a copy of the Toronto Star which had featured a front-page exposé of the group Haworth was involved in, written by the investigative reporter Sidney Katz. Haworth read the piece and contacted Katz immediately to verify his facts. He then, as he describes it, “fell apart at the seams”. Having seen Katz’s research and evidence first hand, at the invitation of the journalist, Haworth angrily confronted the cult’s leaders, and they effectively banished him. He was finally free of them.“That was in October,” he says. “Then, in the November, everything came out about the Jonestown cult. And I knew that could have been me. It took me 11 months to fully recover and get back to myself.”NXIVM (which calls itself a ‘multi-level marketing organisation’) member Allison Mack leaving US District Court after her bail hearing in Brooklyn (Getty)It took that long for the nagging whispers of “Cult Ian”, as Haworth describes the person he was when he was with the group, to be finally silenced, and for “Real Ian” to reassert himself. And good sense would dictate that was the point he turned his back on cults forever and got on with his life.“I come from a farming background in Lancashire,” says Haworth. “People used to say, ‘If there’s summat up, then tha’ does summat about it’. So I did summat about it.”Sidney Katz put Haworth in touch with a TV producer called Peter Scott and together they set up what was first called the Council for Mind Abuse, and which later metamorphosed into the Cult Information Centre in 1987, now run as a charity.I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults. That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thingHaworth and Scott concentrated on the group he had been involved with, even handing out flyers to a party of new recruits flown into Canada, exhorting them to go back to the airport. Faced with Haworth’s evidence, many of them did. Eventually, the resistance proved too much for the group. “Toronto wasn’t big enough for the both of us,” he smiles. “They got out.”Haworth doesn’t know where they are now, or if they still exist. Cults change their names often, to keep one step ahead of the media or inquisitive minds, and to muddy the paper trail they leave behind. Besides, he soon had more than enough on his plate as more and more people began to get in touch, especially after he had relocated back to the UK.One of the Cult Information Centre’s primary roles is working with ex-cult members. He likens the trauma that recovering cult followers go through to PTSD, and says systems to deal with and help them are variable, if present at all.He would also like to see stronger laws to deal with cults there’s no specific legislation surrounding them, and it’s only when cult leaders are discovered to have committed actual crimes, such as Aravindan Balakrishnan in 2015, that the law can act.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh surrounded by devotees (Netflix)The Aravindan Balakrishnan case, and the revelations of Katy Morgan-Davies in her new book, add an extra dimension to Haworth’s work. It’s one thing to try to help cult members who have managed to break free return to their old, pre-cult lives, but what of those born into cults?“If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had,” says Haworth. “You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situation.”And don’t think it is only stupid people who would fall for a cult. Experts say that cults are most likely to be attractive to intelligent, well-educated people… they have flexible minds can consider and be seduced by the alternative lifestyles offered by cults.Documentary about alleged sex cult NXIVM being producedSmallville actor allegedly tried to recruit Emma Watson to ‘sex cult’Waco: what really happened when David Koresh’s cult faced the FBI?From Jonestown in the Seventies to Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s to Brixton in the 2000s: cults endure, and spring up all across the world. Nothing about modern life and its complexities has inured us against the attractions of a charismatic guru or cult leader.“They start off wanting the usual things,” says Haworth. “Money, sex, power over people. Then, after perhaps about 10 years, they start to believe the things they say, they maybe start to believe they are gods.”And as long as the false gods continue to prey on the innocent, Ian Haworth will continue his 40-years-and-counting battle against the scourge of the cults.For more information on Haworth’s work at the Cult Information Centre go to cultinformation.org.ukor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Serendipitously, at the start of this bicentennial year, I found myself invited to a wedding in what used to be called Karl-Marx-Stadt, since renamed Chemnitz, in the former East Germany. Communism may have formally collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union, yet it has not been extinguished.The world’s most populous state and rising superpower, China, is officially communist, albeit nominally. And socialist ideas remain prevalent throughout the world. The resurgence of socialism could be seen in the Chavismo new left wave of Latin American politics (admittedly now in the process of being rolled back). In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital. Its former finance minister and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis describes himself as a lapsed Marxist. His recent essay penned in  cites Marx’s analysis as both the key to understanding our present predicament and the way out of it.John McDonnell says he won\u0027t be a Marxist ChancellorIn 2015, socialism was the most searched word on Merriam Webster’s online dictionary. Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Karl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesKarl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesGerman social, political and economic theorist Karl Marx.

The statues, created by artist Ottmar Hoerl, are part of an exhibition at the Museum Simeonstift Trier that were created to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the death of Marx in 1883. Marx, who was born in Trier, is the author of The Communist Manifesto, and his ideas on the relationship between labour, industry and capital created the ideological foundation for socialist and communist movements across the globe. Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century. And now to the glamour of the big screen. A new Marx biopic – The Young Karl Marx   from I Am Not Your Negro director Raoul Peck  –  has been released. Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

Since 2013, ratings are based on just the one question: ‘Would you recommend your builder to a friend?’ In a statement, Bovis said it had made significant changes to its build quality and customer service, which had transformed the company. It added that it had a strict policy with regards to the HBF customer survey.Bovis Homes expects profits to rise ‘significantly’ this yearA spokesman said: “Currently more than 87 per cent of our customers across the country would recommend us to friends and family, representing a 30 percentage point improvement on where we were at the same time last year.“There are strict rules around the management of the HBF customer survey and we are absolutely committed to adhering to those.“In the current survey year, which started on 1 October 2017, we have so far received more than 740 surveys, and around 87 per cent of those returned would recommend us to family or friends.“If there is any evidence that any one of those hundreds of positive responses – or any from previous years – were not returned according to the rules, then we would wish to see that evidence and we would investigate it thoroughly.”In relation to the case in which £1,000 of a homebuyer’s bills had been paid, Bovis said it was investigating the claim that payment had been conditional on the customer completing her feedback form.A spokesman said: “On this point, we are currently investigating one claim made by a customer to The Independent, where it appears that our processes and procedures have not been followed and the colleague involved has been removed from site while we make further enquiries.”Charlotte and Michael Kenton say they had to have their toilet replaced after they found it broken (Charlotte Kenton)When new CEO Greg Fitzgerald took charge of Bovis – after the resignation of David Ritchie in January 2017 – he promised to ensure that the house builder was no longer “handing over crap or incomplete houses to customers”.Mr Fitzgerald, who made the statement after Bovis was found to have been paying homebuyers as much as £3,000 to move into unfinished homes in a failed attempt to reach an ambitious target of completing 4,131 houses by the end of the financial year, served six years as a company director for the National House Builders Council, the UK’s main home construction warranty provider, prior to his appointment.However, The Independent has been told by several homebuyers that problems with quality remain. Allison Briggs, 49, said that her hi-spec washing machine was broken on the day she moved into her property on a development in April 2017.When Bovis later replaced it, she claimed the whole house vibrated when was the washing machine was on.Bovis Homeowner Allison Briggs\u0027 says this video shows her property shaking due to the structural issues of her homeShe told The Independent: “I am living in a Bovis nightmare. I wish I could walk away.”Another, who bought their property in January 2017, said they had experienced problems immediately. But when they approached Bovis, the house builder allegedly told them the house being situated on a corner caused the issues. They told The Independent: “We raised the issue again with Bovis and yet again we were told every excuse possible.”In a statement, Bovis said: “We are committed to continuing to drive through these improvements in our business and to deal with any customer issues by our home warranty.In those rare instances where items might be disputed, then we welcome the involvement of external agencies, such as the NHBC, to objectively assess the issues, and we are committed to meeting all of our obligations in these instances.”“We apologise to any customer who did not move into the home they deserved in the past, but we are concerned that using isolated historic case studies as a reflection of our current performance misrepresents the business and will have a negative impact for those thousands of satisfied Bovis Homes customers who are not being contacted by the media for their experiences of buying a new-build home.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesDominick Chilcott, right, British ambassador in Turkey, hands over a letter of apology from the UK government to Libyan dissident Abdel Hakim Belhaj,  at the British Consulate, in Istanbul.

Even the government’s own research says the northeast economy will lose growth once we leave the EU regardless of the dealFive Labour MPs from the North East“Because this is so important, we believe the British people should have their say on the final Brexit deal.“Just as the people had their say in the referendum in 2016, we believe the final decision on this country’s destiny should lie with the British people in a people’s vote.”The MPs in particular highlight how firms like Nissan in Sunderland, Hitachi in County Durham and in the chemicals industry on Teesside, providing thousands of jobs, see their future within the EU customs union and single market – which both Conservative and Labour leaderships are committed to quitting.Keir Starmer: Brexit deal means UK will be tied to single market ‘in perpetuity’They also raise concerns over damage to the NHS and concessions that will have to be made to other countries to secure trade deals.They write: “There is so much at stake here. Even the government’s own research says the northeast economy will lose growth once we leave the EU regardless of the deal.“This will hit living standards of families throughout the region. A smaller economy will mean less money to invest in our hard pressed public services.“Already the British economy has fallen from the top to the bottom of the European growth league.”Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Don’t stop on the side of the road,” Doug Bos, the owner of the zoo, told CBC News in January, when the footage was shared. “If everybody would listen to the video, that’s what the message was – don’t do this.”Where not to visit if you love animalsWhere not to visit if you love animalsChimpanzees are forced to perform demeaning tricks on leashes and are often subject to cruel training techniques. Animals who are confined to small, barren enclosures and forced to perform unsurprisingly show symptoms of stress and depression. Chimpanzees have been documented rocking back and forth, sucking their lips, salivating and swaying against enclosure perimeters in distress.Some marine parks use bottlenose dolphins in performances and offer visitors the opportunity to swim with dolphins. Unfortunately, people are often unaware that these animals are captured in the wild and torn from their families or traded between different parks around the world.Tigers are forced to live in an unnatural and barren environment and have to endure interactions with a constant stream of tourists. Since tigers never lose their wild instincts, across the world they are reportedly drugged, mutilated and restrained in order to make them “safe” for the public. However, every year, incidents of tiger maulings are reported at this type of tourist attraction.Sunning on the beach is great for humans – we can take a quick dip or catch a bite to eat when we get too hot or hungry. But it\u0027s pure hell for donkeys who are confined to the beach and forced to cart children around on the hot sand. Some donkey-ride operators at beach resorts in the UK even keep the animals chained together at all times. Some parks confine orcas to concrete tanks and force them to perform meaningless tricks for food - many die in captivity. Orcas are highly intelligent and social mammals who may suffer immensely, both physically and mentally, when they\u0027re held in captivity.Lions are confined to fenced areas so that they can easily be cornered, with no chance of escape. Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a hunting enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving.Every year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls. The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town\u0027s narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs. City streets are no place for horses. The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long. As easily spooked prey animals, horses subjected to the loud noises and unexpected sounds of city streets are likely to be involved in accidents, even deadly ones. The zoo community regards the animals it keeps as commodities, and animals are regularly bought, sold, borrowed and traded without any regard for established relationships. Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there\u0027s nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we recently saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further. At the time, a trainer said there were no safety concerns, as the bear was secured by a chain and the film had been taken before the Dairy Queen had opened for the day. Football team condemned after muzzled bear forced to deliver ballMan ‘trying to take selfie’ with bear is mauled to deathFirst polar bear bred in Singapore dies after five-year health battlePark staff accidentally kill one of world’s rarest bearsFemale bears evolve to hunting threat by raising cubs for longerThe zoo, located in Innisfail, Alberta, has now been charged under the Wildlife Act for taking the bear out without informing the authorities – one count relates to the ice cream excursion and the other for failing to inform officials the bear was being taken home nightly for bottle-feeding in 2017.The owners of the wildlife park, Mr Bos and Debbie Rowland, have said they plan to plead guilty. “We made a mistake. I’m embarrassed about it,” Mr Bos told . “Every time we take an animal off the property, we’re supposed to notify Fish and Wildlife, send them an email, and we forgot to do that in both instances.”The zoo’s permit has also been revised to include new conditions requiring the zoo to provide more details when transporting animals and to keep them in a cage, crate or kennel while in a vehicle.Members of the public will also be barred from having any contact with animals, including bears. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The arrests were often violent, and sometimes with the support of unofficial vigilante forces. Police released Mr Navalny later that evening, but many of his supporters remained in custody throughout the inauguration. Today’s ceremony mainly followed the protocol of previous years, but there were departures. The major innovation was the debut of Mr Putin’s new 12.5bn ruble limousine, the “Kortezh”. But the car would not sweep through central Moscow as six years ago. The image of a depopulated city centre on lockdown that day left an awkward aftertaste, and today there would be no repeat.Instead, Mr Putin’s new limousine made the short trip from his Kremlin offices to the ceremonial halls. Key Putin opponent among hundreds arrested in violent Moscow clashesTrump targets Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in fresh US sanctionsDonald Trump suggested meeting Vladimir Putin at the White HouseTrump ‘tells Vladimir Putin: “If there is an arms race, ‘I’ll win’”Inside, dignitaries included some of Mr Putin’s closest friends, like the former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and American actor Steven Seagal. There were the stars of Russia’s beau monde – from film director Nikita Mikhalkov to rapper Timati. And there was a mix of the stranger symbols of Mr Putin’s rule: biker Alexander Zaldostanov, aka “the surgeon” the uber-loyal head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill and the tsar-worshipping, ultra-conservative Natalia Poklonskaya. Pro-Kremlin youth and the heads of the regional electoral commission were also on the guest list. These groups were the sergeants of March’s presidential elections, considered a great success. That vote returned Mr Putin with a 77 per cent share, and proved to be a disaster for the liberal opposition. Looking relaxed, contented, and not without swagger, Mr Putin delivered a short address. The message was simple enough. The president repeated the promises of a decisive technological breakthrough he first made during his state-of-the-nation speech in March. But he was notably less belligerent this time. Nuclear weapons had given way to motherhood, youth and raising living standards. “Russia has been through troubles before,” he said. “And we always rise above them, like a Phoenix.” Later in the day, the president confirmed that, as expected, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would retain his role as head of the government. According to some sources, Mr Putin was also likely to appoint the liberal reformer Alexei Kudrin to a top economic post. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesMissiles rise into the sky as Israeli missiles hit air defense position and other military bases, in Damascus, Syria.

These will mostly be paid for by increased taxes, given the limited appetite for serious reform.“No one is debating whether to reject crony capitalism, state control of business and the economy, or the confrontation with the West,” said Valery Solovey, professor of the Moscow State Institute for International Relations. “Of course, this is why there will be no real breakthrough”.According to a poll published on Monday by the independent Levada Centre, Russians say welfare and inequality remain the government’s biggest failure to date. The Kremlin fares better when it comes to foreign policy, with half mentioning the return of great power status as Mr Putin’s major achievement. The combination of both factors means political liberalisation is unlikely to be around the corner, Mr Solovey said.“It is too early to make strategic conclusions,” said Mr Solovey. “But if confrontation with the West and social tensions continue on their current trajectory, domestic policy is only going to get tougher.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

There is a limit to what volunteers can take on.\u0026ldquoBesides that, most people pay council tax, a fee to the DVLA for having a motor car, petrol duty and the all the rest.\u0026ldquoJust what do we get for our money?\u0026ldquoIf higher authorities wish to pass down further duties to parishes, then let\u0027s have a proper structure with some funding being passed down to parishes and town councils.\u0026ldquoI am perfectly certain that with some funding from Suffolk County Council, parishes could, through approved contractors, make a better job of minor repairs to paths and roads.\u0026ldquoAt present, the public are getting restless and frustrated at what is happening in local government.\u0026ldquoEarlier this year, Suffolk County Council announced plans to save around \u0026pound24m and increase council tax by almost five per cent.The \u0026pound490m budget was backed by a full meeting of the Conservative-controlled council by 45 votes to 17.Suffolk County Council said the new approach would allow members of the public to support local roads, paths, verges and rights of way.It emphasised however that it would never ask volunteers to fill in potholes or work on or near a carriageway, for safety reasons.John Nunn, parish and district councillor for Long Melford, added that the scheme presented a number of issues, such as whether volunteers will be covered by county council insurance and receive proper funding and safety training.                Mosul: Volunteers reveal what they REALLY see                 Lonely: Just two hours a week volunteering could help solve crisisHe said: \u0026ldquoMany people will think this idea is one step too far for the public to volunteer for, whereas others may be willing to keep their village clean and tidy.\u0026ldquoI am sure opinions will be split.The council explained that a recent survey of 152 parish and town councils found that 53 per cent already undertook minor highways work, including cutting grass, spreading grit, clearing snow and cleaning road signs.In the survey, 34 per cent of respondents said they would be interested in doing minor work, while 66 per cent said either they would not be interested, or they are not right now but may be in the future.A Suffolk Highways spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are currently looking into potential ways that Suffolk\u0027s town and parish councils could support us in delivering minor remedial works in their community.\u0026ldquoWe understand from many councils that they are keen to do more.\u0026ldquoHowever, our priority concern is the safety of anyone who may be involved in this activity.In 2014, Suffolk Police were criticised for encouraging officers to use their own vehicles for police business as it worked out cheaper than renting vehicles or organising pool cars."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Frankfurt-957876.jpg","title":"brexit news uk eu london germany frankfurt finance market","story":"After the EU exit vote Frankfurt-based banks appealed to Britain\u0027s bankers to make the move to Germany\u0026rsquos finance industry two years ago, after the Brexit announcement sparks concerns over London\u0026rsquos number one position in European banking.Brexodus was a term Remainer\u0026rsquos seized on with regards to reports UK\u0027s banks were looking to leave the capital.However, London\u0027s markets continue to thrive, leaving Frankfurt\u0027s efforts in vain as Germany struggles to pool in UK talent to its main capital.Frankfurt\u0027s international appeal stands below London, as the UK economy continues to remain viable and productive - despite Britain leaving the EU.Reports in Germany suggest bankers are snubbing Frankfurt                Angela Merkel\u0027s plot to lure British bankers thwarted by families                Germany news: \u0027Merkel must go\u0027 protesters clash with policeA comment article in Germany\u0026rsquos Business Insider says: \u0026ldquoDespite Brexit, London could prove to be a bastion in the fight for financial capital hegemony.

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling?

A fog descends, confusion reigns, even my own handwriting is a mystery, the words written by a stranger who slipped away while I slept.It all started in 2012: I was 56, healthy, a non-smoker, and I worked as an NHS manager at St James’s Hospital in Leeds.But there was an impending sense of something I couldn’t put my finger on. It had lingered for a few months. Everything was getting slower. On bad days, my mind couldn’t instantly recall names and faces and places like it used to. It just wasn’t me.September 2012I’m the one my colleagues nickname the guru because my recall is so sharp, because I can problem-solve in a second, remembering who works night shifts, who needs which day off.I’d brought up my two daughters - Gemma and Sarah alone since their dad left when they were four and seven. It was hard, but there was always a way that was my motto.But the snowdrift that seems to have settled in my mind remains, along with a lack of energy and the same feeling I can’t put my finger on.One day I’m out running, and I fall flat onto the pavement. There are another three falls in quick succession.Later, I am sitting in a hospital waiting room.The sensation of a head half-filled with cotton wool has continued for months and this weekend had been much worse.When I got to work on Monday, my colleague noticed how my words were slurred, and now I’m here.In the end, doctors blame a hole in the heart for causing a stroke.March 2013 I’m back at work after the stroke.The things I do forget – names or numbers, places, people – well, that’s understandable. It’s because I’ve been off for months, or at least that’s what everyone says, and I start to believe it myself. Almost.But two months later, I’m sitting in front of a consultant neurologist, trying to pinpoint the vagueness I’ve been feeling.What sense would it make to her if I told her about that thick pile of yellow Post-it notes scattered on the carpet by my bed had got thicker and thicker, as I woke numerous times desperate to remember all I’ll need to get through a day in the office.My mind just doesn’t feel … sharp, is all I can offer, and the consultant nods and writes down some notes.A month on, I’m seeing a clinical psychologist called Jo.Is there anything I should do to help myself in the times when my mind feels particularly … foggy? I ask.There may be times when you become disorientated, the fog will descend and your surroundings will be unfamiliar,” she says. But the most important thing to remember is not to panic, give the fog time to pass, let the world become clear again. And it will.That’s all. She’ll see me again in 12 months.I’m sitting opposite Sarah while she holds a letter in her hand from Jo.It is possible that this is a profile of the early stages of a dementing process, it reads.A few weeks later, another letter, this time from the neurologist. To be certain [of this representing an early dementia] we would need to demonstrate deteriorating cognition in six to 12 months’ time. If no change I would diagnose mild cognitive impairment, he writes.Sarah and Gemma are with me as I read this. The three of us sit quietly.I look at my two little girls, that’s nothing to do with my memory, just the lens a mother always views her children through, the urge to protect them never dims.September 2013Six months later, I’m in a meeting at work.I glance around the table at the familiar faces, and yet I can’t recall their names.  Tiny seeds of worry whittle away inside as I shuffle my paperwork, confused about where to start.I look up. We expect to start rolling out the system in two months’ time … I pause, every eye upon me, but the word I need next is lost -  there’s a blank in my mind where it should be.Silence hangs in the room, and for a fraction of a second I’m sure they’re wondering if I’m fit for this job. I feel stupid then. Stupid, frustrated, confused, humiliated.An hour later, the meeting finishes, people file from the room, and then it come to me. The word I was trying to remember was and.I wake and sit on the edge of my bed, looking down at my feet. Where once there was pale green carpet, I’m now crunching yellow Post-it notes between my toes.The pile has grown thicker after another restless night of waking, turning, remembering something else I’ll need for the next day. I need to move, but I can’t think what I do first. Dress? Eat? Shower?I’ve become a master of disguise, but there are days when I can’t camouflage the confusion. I dread the knock on my office door, the blank I know will be written across my face.A sister on the ward who phones me and I don’t know who she is. I buy time, ask her to come to my office. When she does, I realise we’re friends.I thought I’d done something to offend you! she’d said. And I laugh it off, blaming a busy day.June 2014I’m sitting in front of Jo again.She starts going through the same memory tests as before. But when she asks me to name objects beginning with a certain letter, nothing comes. She asks me to draw a clock, I don’t know where to start.It’s obvious to both of us that there’s been a decline, fear is gathering in the pit of my stomach.Over the next two weeks, I do more memory tests. They don’t go well. What do you think it could be? I ask finally.She looks into my eyes, and her voice is calm and steady. Possibly dementia, but I can’t be completely sure, not until we get the results of all the tests.Of course, I reply. But a numbness embraces me, and a sadness too, a feeling that this is the end because that’s all I know about dementia - the blank stares, the helplessness, the confusion.In bed later, I lie awake, unable to push dark thoughts from my mind. Is it really dementia? Might the doctors be wrong?July 31, 2014I’m sitting in the cramped office of the neurologist as she shuffles through her paperwork.As she starts to speak, I notice the pity in her eyes.It’s early-onset Alzheimer’s.Nothing prepares you for the feeling of emptiness.It’s not so much a fear of death that hits me, but a sense of time running out.That’s what dementia steals, the future you imagined all laid out in front of you, with no idea when something more final might come.Good luck, says the neurologist as I leave her office. I won’t see her again, because there’s no follow-up after diagnosis.September 2014I’ve been relying on the Post-It notes I write to myself, reminding me to take my pills, book a dental appointment. But they’re starting to fail me now.What good is a note to yourself if you forget to look for it?I pull the calendar down from the wall and start to fill my iPad with doctor’s appointments, friends’ visits, a daily reminder to take my tablets and to put the rubbish bins out.I hesitate over October 17th, Sarah’s birthday, just a few weeks away.Surely I’d never forget a date as important as that - but just in case, I set a reminder for the evening of her birthday. Anyway, I always ring her in the morning.October 17, 2014I go to work, then come home and start making myself something to eat. I’m humming along to the radio when I hear a ping.Puzzled, I open up the iPad. And when I see the reminder, my insides turn icy-cold. It can’t be. There must be a mistake.I check the date on the calendar, abandon my meal and reach for the phone. I’m shaking as I dial Sarah’s number.I’m so sorry, I say. I-I don’t know how it happened.It’s OK, she says. You just forgot.Nothing can ease the sadness, the mortification: I’ve forgotten my own daughter’s birthday for the first time in 34 years.My logical mind knows that it’s the disease, not me, but on a day like today it’s hard to tell us apart.February 2015Six months after the diagnosis. I tell my managers, my heart beating so hard I wonder if it can be seen through my shirt.A month later, I’m having a meeting with the occupational health consultant. I’m still managing my team efficiently— I begin.But she’s already filling in a section headed: Incapable of meeting the demands of her NHS employment.My fate has been decided.It’s Sunday, and I’m ironing at home in front of the TV.I’ve discovered upsides to dementia. I can watch The Great British Bake Off again and again.When I get to the series finale, the winner is always a surprise to me, and then I go right back to the first episode and get to know the contestants all over again.A progressive illness can focus the mind in a very special way, and I’ve resolved to find out all there is to know about this dreadful disease.I vow that I’m going to remain independent for as long as I possibly can.There’s always a way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Abdel Hakim Belhaj, 52, and his wife Fatima Boudchar claimed they were returned to the brutal regime in 2004 through a joint M16-CIA operation following Tony Blair\u0027s infamous deal in the desert with the Libyan dictator. Attorney General Jeremy Wright admitted Britain\u0027s role in the rendition today, announcing \u0026pound500,000 would be paid in compensation to Mrs Boudchar. But Mr Belhaj always made clear that he was not seeking monetary compensation and will not receive any. The Prime Minister has written to them both to apologise. Mr Wright said the Government had reached a full and final settlement with the pair, who had taken the government, Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6 and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw to court. Mr Wright said that Prime Minister Theresa May has written to Mr Belhaj and his wife to apologise for their appalling treatment. But as part of the settlement, neither Sir Mark nor Mr Straw admitted liability. Mr Wright explained the outcome of the settlement to the Commons. He said: First: No admissions of liability have been made by any of the defendants in settling these claims. Secondly: The claimants have now withdrawn their claims against all the defendants. Thirdly: The government has agreed to pay Mrs Bouchard \u0026pound500,000. Mr Belhaj did not seek and has not been given any compensation. Finally: I have met Mr Belhaj and Mrs Bouchard, indeed Mrs Bouchard is present in the gallery to hear this statement. And the Prime Minister has now written to them both to apologise. In her apology, the Prime Minister accepted the British government had a role in their detention and Mr Belhaj\u0027s torture .   Government expected to apologise to Libyan man kidnapped and tortured after \u0027British tip-off\u0027  She wrote: Your accounts were moving and what happened to you is deeply troubling. It is clear that you were both subjected to appalling treatment and that you suffered greatly, not least the affront to the dignity of Mrs Bouchard who was pregnant at the time. The UK Government believes your accounts. Neither of you should have been treated in this way. The UK Government\u0027s actions contributed to your detention, rendition and suffering. The UK Government shared information about you with its international partners. We should have done more to reduce the risk that you would be mistreated. We accept that this was a failing on our part. Later, during your detention in Libya, we sought information about and from you. We wrongly missed opportunities to alleviate your plight. This should not have happened. On behalf of Her Majesty\u0027s Government, I apologise unreservedly. Ms Boudchar, who was five months pregnant when she and her husband were returned to Libya, was in Parliament when Mr Wright made the apology.

The answer is not much more than a year, judging by one family’s horrendous experience. Great granddad Arthur Marshall bought the home in Rosewarne Park in Camborne, Cornwall, completing the purchase in May 2016. After he died in June 2017 his family tried to sell it. “We had a cash buyer for \u0026pound90,000 but due to all the faults that were found the home was not fit for sale,” said his daughter Ann Early. “There are numerous cracks appearing in the outside walls so water has got into the insulation, if you push the walls hard your hand goes straight through.”  She took up the issue with Berkeley Parks, the site owners, and the manufacturers Stately-Albion Limited. “The home was bought new from Berkeley Parks so should never have deteriorated like this so that by the time my father died 15 months later it was unsaleable,” she says.  “They say to do the repairs they need a week with no rain, which is going to be hard to get in Cornwall.”  Stately-Albion carried out one visit to make temporary repairs but now Ann says they are ignoring her emails. Ironically, its website boasts: “You can put your concerns to one side with the knowledge that your new home will be safe in our hands.” The home even came with a “Gold Shield” warranty, which Stately-Albion claims “provides your home with protection for 10 years against any major inherent defects”.

As with every wedding, royal or not, Harry and Meghan\u0027s guestlist has caused family drama.  While the prince was apparently keen for this aunt to be there, Prince Charles has snubbed her from the evening reception at Frogmore House , which he is paying for.  Fergie is said to be deeply unhappy at the snub, whereas Charles simply doesn\u0027t have time for her. Despite still being close to her ex-husband and mum to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, Fergie\u0027s relationship with the rest of the royals is frosty to say the least. Prince Philip in particular is said to not have any time for her, owing to her many misdemeanours.   According to the Daily Beast , Philip has been unable to forgive Fergie for the damage he perceives she did to the family via her series of extramarital affairs and subsequent commercial work.   So where did it all go wrong for Fergie? Here\u0027s a look at some of her most infamous incidents.   1. Footsie   Also known as  the infamous toe-sucking scandal.  Back in 1992, Fergie and Andrew had officially separated, but weren\u0027t legally divorced. That same year, Fergie enjoyed a holiday to St Tropez with her American financial advisor, a man called John Bryan who, in some shots captured by the paparazzi, appeared to be sucking her toes while she sunbathed topless.  When the royals came downstairs the next day to their breakfast and morning papers, they were greeted with this unexpected sight. Royal commentator, Dickie Arbiter, recently told viewers of the ITV programme The Royal Wives of Windsor Okay you don\u0027t expect somebody to crawl through the bushes to take photographs of you topless while your financial advisor is sucking your toes. You don’t expect that but by the same token you don’t go away with somebody that isn\u0027t your husband and sunbathe topless. Needless to say, the Firm were not best pleased...  2. Weight-watchers Fast-forward to 1996, and Fergie and Andrew are officially divorced. But there were still stormy waters ahead. Enterprising Fergie signed deals with both Wedgwood china and Weight Watchers, with the latter proving to be especially controversial.  While Fergie\u0027s partnership with Weight Watchers proved to be lucrative (according to the Mail Online it paid her \u0026pound2 million a year) and lasted for 11 years, the idea of royal appearing in adverts was pretty much unheard of.   Fergie, however, was pretty open about it, telling USA Today, I\u0027d just been divorced and I needed to earn a living. I still do. Then there were some comments the mum-of-two made in 1997 about her youngest daughter, Beatrice. I mean, she is only 8, but she definitely can pack it on a bit, Fergie told The Independent, adding, Poor baby. I think overeating sort of runs in the family. These comments prompted Weight Watchers to issue a rather brusque rebuttal, saying: Weight Watchers UK does not believe that children should ever be encouraged to diet.  3. The fault in her stars The nineties definitely had their suboptimal moments for the Duchess of York. Shortly before her observations about her young daughter\u0027s weight were made publi came more controversy for Fergie. In December 1996 Fergie’s former astrologist Madame Vasso published Fergie: The Very Private Life of the Duchess of York.

Joyce Currie has been going to the beauty spot since 1925 when she was six-months-old - and even still has the picture with her dad from that trip. She learnt to swim there and eventually took her own children there as a young mother - and swam in the sea until she was 90. Joyce even moved to the village 22 years ago from the Midlands in order to enjoy the coast which she considered to be “the most beautiful beach in the world”. The Blue Flag beach at Fairbourne has two miles of sandy beaches surrounded by the Snowdonia National Park and a heritage railway linking the coast to the village.  Joyce has been going to the beach in north Wales every day and accesses the shoreline by a concrete ramp. But local authority Gwynedd Council has now taken away the ramp - which made it inaccessible to people with mobility problems. Now it has been removed, there is only a bank of stones standing between would-be beach-goers and the sandy shore.  Joyce said: “This Sunday was the first time in 93 years that I couldn’t get on the beach. I would have loved to get down to the gorgeous sand. “The ramp could have been easily repaired. On a good summer’s day two years ago the beach would have been crowded. “People would go down with pushchairs and wheelchairs.”  Joyce dreams of being able to take great-granddaughter Robyn, aged 19 months, to build sandcastles and paddle in the sea, just as she did as a child. “We had all our holidays here, I learnt to swim here,” she said. “I brought my own children here, and my grandchildren, and I would like nothing more than to take my great-granddaughter on the beach to make sandcastles.  “I swam in the sea here till I was in my 90th year, but can’t now get down to the sands because there is no ramp. “I can’t bring Robyn here to make sandcastles, like I did with my three children.” Joyce and other members of the community voiced their concerns to Gwynedd Council but are unsatisfied with the response.

Its director 29-year-old Dean Jacobs of Halesowen, West Midlands, blames the client for not paying the wages.  “The customer they were working for, Solgen Commercial, owed us just under \u0026pound200,000,” Mr Jacobs claimed. “We kept paying the wages for weeks without payment from the client, so we said to the guys, we have to lay you off, if you choose to go back that\u0027s up to you, we are not liable. “They went back anyway and because the customer has not paid them they\u0027re chasing me.” One of those out of pocket is site manager Simon Farthing. “It\u0027s a load of twaddle what Dean Jacobs is saying,” he responded. “He did not tell anyone not to go on the site, and was paid in full. I\u0027m owed \u0026pound2,667, it\u0027s put me in a right tight spot. “I had to cancel a holiday with the family to Minorca, and my mum and dad had to bail me out to help with some bills.” Another victim is electrician\u0027s mate Plamen Hristov.  We were promised \u0026pound21 an hour but got just \u0026pound8.75 - welcome to the world of casual labour  “I\u0027m owed \u0026pound1,000, it\u0027s two weeks money,” he said. “I did try to speak to Dean Jacobs lots of times but he puts the phone down.”  Plant operator Ron Hinson is owed more than \u0026pound2,000 and said: “I spoke to the project manager and he said all the wages were paid to Dean Jacobs, he\u0027s led us up the garden path.” Solgen Commercial is furious at Mr Jacobs\u0027 allegation that it withheld wages and described working with him as “a nightmare”. “We got half way through and I would loved to have dumped him but we had to keep the guys working through him,” said director Sarah Yeo. “He sold the invoices to Pulse Cashflow Services, so we owed Pulse, not him. “We paid Pulse Cashflow and I assure you we paid everything we owed in full. “There were a couple of invoices we didn\u0027t pay, probably only totally a couple of thousand pounds, but that was because he did not provide timesheets for them. We paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for three projects over several weeks.” Pulse Cashflow refused to comment, citing the Data Protection Act. But it added: “If you were familiar with invoice finance you would understand that the company remains responsible for its own staff and creditors, as it receives a substantial advance payment against the debts which are assigned to any factor. How the business spends this money is entirely at their discretion.”  There\u0027s yet another company involved – Sarah Yeo admitted it was “a bit confusing”, which is sadly typical of agency working. This company is Mayfair Payroll Services, which told Plamen Hristov in an email that it was still waiting for funds from Mr Jacobs. I phoned but was told that it had stopped trading. Whoever answered my call would not give the details of whatever business is now using the same number: “We\u0027re not obliged to say.”   This mess reminds me of another case I highlighted earlier this year, that of pipe-fitter Russ Blakely who was employed through a series of “umbrella” and payroll companies.  He won an employment tribunal after being denied basic rights such as holiday pay, in a case taken up by Unite, Britain\u0027s biggest union.

Simone Grainger and husband Steven discussed his drug use in a series of texts and WhatsApp messages to each other that were read out in court. Simone would leave the written messages as well as record voice messages, in which children can be heard playing in the background, to her husband including that marrying him was the worst mistake of her life. The messages centred around his drug use leading up to when her body was found in the first home they shared. Grainger, 32, is accused of hitting her over the head with a saucepan before strangling her and rolling her in blankets and leaving her in the conservatory of the house. Simone\u0027s cousin found her body when she visited the house because she was concerned she had not heard from her.  Grainger denies murdering his wife on November 4 last year and sat the dock at Reading Crown Court listening intently as 1,500 messages were read through by barristers. The court previously heard Simone had told a friend before her death how her sex life was a bit like something from an episode of Doctor Foster, the hit ITV psychological drama.  Francis Fitzgibbon QC, prosecuting, said Simone had confided in two friends that she and Grainger had sex two days before her death.  He said: She said it was a bit like something from an episode of Doctor Foster. Despite Mrs Grainger\u0027s anger and frustration they maintained a degree of intimacy. Mr Fitzgibbon also outlined messages Grainger sent after he is accused of killing the mother of his two children, in which it was said he contacted a prostitute for sex.  A mixture of WhatsApp, text and iMessage\u0027s from early in 2017 to the morning of the death were read to the jury by the prosecution about Grainger\u0027s drug habits. Simone sent one message to Grainger saying: I don\u0027t wanna be with someone who makes me miserable. The next month, Simone again messaged the defendant with: You constantly defend yourself, you are weird at night and can\u0027t sleep. You\u0027re always making mistakes. Grainger replied: I\u0027m sick of going on like this, everyday you make me out to be a c**t. In June, Simone messaged her husband and said: You\u0027re a druggy and a liar, to which Grainger replied: I\u0027ll spend the rest of my married life making it up to you.  Simone later responded by saying I wish I hadn\u0027t married you. Then in a spate of late night messages in July, Simone said I seriously can\u0027t stand you, druggy is your middle name, coke head c**t, s**t dad, you\u0027re lucky the kids have got my dad, coke heads ain\u0027t family men, and p**s off and die. The next day as the arguing continued, Simone sent in a message: The coke stopped your brain, you made me want to stab you.  Grainger replied: I\u0027ve been a p***k and will make it up to you, I\u0027ll never leave without you knowing again. Simone responded: You\u0027re constantly doing it, druggy c**t. Call me a d**k again and I\u0027ll stab you, you\u0027re selfish c**k.  Into September, two months before the death of Simone, messages were sent both ways. Simone said: Go to work you sad p***k, go and live on your mum\u0027s sofa where you\u0027re destined to end up. FYI you\u0027re an a***hole, a druggy and a drunk. Grainger said: You think it\u0027s normal, that you want to stab me? In another series of messages, the mum of two said: We are over, stop taking me for a p***k. You\u0027re a f*****g b*****d and I hope you get what\u0027s coming for you, die. The jury then heard the messages between the couple after Grainger failed to turn up to the family Centre Parcs holiday after he had bought five bags of cocaine for the trip but had gone on a binge the night before. Grainger sent to a friend: I had five bags to take to Centre Parcs and ended up like Henry Hoover.

As a nation we just all really love Prince Harry . We’ve been rooting for him, hard, since we saw that image that haunts us – which I don’t even need to expand on, because everyone immediately knows what I mean – back in 1997.  That’s over 20 years of rooting. So we’re pretty much definitely, unreservedly, on board with anyone who makes him as happy as he currently is.  Obviously it doesn’t hurt that Ms Markle’s ’mazing in her own right, too though. It’s the buttercream icing on top of the lemon and elderflower wedding cake she’s chosen, which is just the kind of perfect detail that makes us like her even more.  The funny thing is that Harry’s so delighted with her, we’d have loved and accepted Meghan wholeheartedly whatever she was like. It’s almost a waste for her to be as good as she is.  Let’s put aside the obvious (ethnicity, marital status, etc) because it’s a breath of stale air to describe her as a breath of fresh air, and yet impossible not to. There’s something extra about Meghan that seems different. Maybe it’s because she’s from another country, so hasn’t grown up being fully familiar with how stiff and formal the royals are... or maybe she knows all too well, and has decided it’s time for a change. The Royal Family are famously standoffish, but Meghan’s a hugger. When we see her with the public, sometimes it can seem a bit much, but that’s just because of how conditioned we are, what we’ve become used to over the years. Everywhere she goes at the moment, she’s meeting people who are genuinely thrilled for her, swept up in her love story and fervently wishing her the best – it’s actually extremely appropriate to be charmed by that. Meghan’s not being over the top, she’s behaving like a normal human being with feelings rather than a stuffy robot.

Little 22-month Olivia\u0027s symptoms were dismissed as daydreaming but mum Lisa Taylor knew it was more. The tot kept losing her balance, had a lazy eye, would stare into the distance for ten seconds at a time and repeatedly covered her ears as if in pain. She actually had a huge tumour pressing on her optic nerve, which led her to going rapidly blind. The tumour is currently inoperable due to the severe risk to Olivia’s remaining eyesight.  But doctors initially said Olivia was staring into the distance because she simply had her head in the clouds. Mrs Taylor, 33, said: I was noticing little things so was taking her to the doctor quite a lot. Eventually she started getting a bit of a squint in her right eye and this lazy eye was her main symptom. We took her to an epilepsy specialist because she kept having blank outs where she stares for about ten seconds - doctors said she was daydreaming. I just knew something wasn\u0027t right. It was mother\u0027s instinct and so I kept taking her back. I went to A\u0026ampE a couple of times and to the opticians.  Eventually Olivia was diagnosed with a grade one hypothalamic chiasmatic glioma on January 4. The non-cancerous tumour arises in and around the optic nerve which connects the eye to the brain. She began chemotherapy on January 17 but had lost all her vision by February. She was scared to play alone and often sought her mother\u0027s hand for reassurance. There is a cyst around the tumour, and on March 22 surgeons operated on it to reduce pressure on her optic nerve. That teamed with the chemo has meant some of Olivia\u0027s missing vision has returned. In the meantime, her family have raised almost \u0026pound60,000, setting up a \u0027Go Fund Me\u0027 page shortly after she was diagnosed with donations reaching nearly \u0026pound40,000. A fundraiser held by family and friends last month raised a further \u0026pound18,000. The fundraising was also boosted with help from Olivia\u0027s grandfather, Tony Currie, a former England footballer, who played in the 1973 World Cup qualifier against Poland.

A poll of 1,240 parents revealed one in 20 have even seen their own child hurt by a toy, food item or other unsuitable gift left in a party bag. As a result, nine in 10 support more stringent safety regulations on the items commonly put into the post-birthday packages.  The study was conducted by ChannelMum after Australian toddler Alby Fox Davis choked to death on a bouncy ball given out in the party bags at his fourth birthday party.   ChannelMum founder Siobhan Freegard said: “Party bags are an exciting and enchanting part of childhood - but we sometimes give our kids items in the bags which we’d never normally let them play with.   “It seems common sense is often forgotten in the rush of preparing for the party. “When making up the bags, check each type of toy before you add it in. If you wouldn’t be happy with your child playing with it normally, then simply don’t include it. “There are lots of great alternatives which are better for the environment and better for your child and their friends.” The most common problem caused by party bags is an allergic reaction to sweets or other foodstuffs included in the bags, with a third of those parents who saw a child hurt saying it was as a result of this. A quarter have caught a child choking on a toy, balloon or bouncy ball while one in 50 have even seen a child choke on a pen lid.  A further 24 per cent have witnessed a child who has had a severe reaction to a temporary tattoo, paint or glitter product, and one in nine kids have cut themselves on a poorly-made party favour. Researchers found party bags are given out at 93 per cent of children’s parties, but more than half of parents admit they wouldn’t be confident in giving first aid to a child maimed by a party bag toy. It also emerged almost four in 10 parents start giving out party bags as early as their child’s first birthday, with the offerings most commonly going on until age 10. Worryingly, 28 per cent of parents admit they forget to check if the bags they give out are safe, while a quarter don’t always make sure bags their child is gifted at other parties are acceptable.

Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, 41, should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency Caesarean section as the infant boy was in a breech position. But instead the doctor attempted to carry out the delivery naturally, it was claimed. Tragedy struck when Dr Laxman urged the patient to push while herself applying traction to the baby\u0027s legs, the hearing was told. The manoevre caused the infant\u0027s head to become detached and remain in his mother\u0027s womb while the rest of the body was removed. Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant\u0027s head. It was re-attached to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye. It is claimed the mother was not even in established labour at the time.  At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, the mother - known only as Patient A - came to face with Dr Laxman and, in a harrowing exchange across the room, looked at her and said I don\u0027t forgive you, I don\u0027t forgive you as the doctor stared down at the floor. The patient then looked away as Laxman\u0027s QC apologised on her behalf. The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16, 2014 whilst Dr Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors. The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated. In heartbreaking evidence Patient A, who was holding two teddy bears in her arms, told the hearing it was the first time she was due to give birth and added: I had been for a scan the previous Friday and I was told my son was breech and the nurse told me if anything had happened to my son it was going to be a c-section. But when I was taken to the labour suite nobody told me what was happening. A lot of people were talking they kept saying the baby needed to come out but nobody looked at me in the eye and told me what was going to happen. There were two doctors between my legs, one on my right hand side holding my hand and there were other people there too. I was examined by a doctor but she didn\u0027t say anything to me. They were checking for the baby\u0027s heartbeat and it had plummeted and that\u0027s when I was told it was going to come out. \u0027I remember them saying I was 2-3cm dilated and I was told to push. Nobody said I was not having a C-section and doing something else instead. Whilst this was going on I was in pain. The only pain relief I was given was a spray on my tongue. I was told it was meant to loosen my cervix but I was not given gas and air - I was in pain. I had the doctors putting their hands inside me and I had them pushing on my stomach and then pulling me down.  I tried to get off the bed but they pulled me back three times and just said they had to get the baby out. They twice tried to cut my cervix and nobody told me they were going to do it. There was no anaesthetic. I said to them \u0027it doesn\u0027t feel right, stop it, what\u0027s going on, I don\u0027t want to do it\u0027 but nobody responded to me in any way. Afterwards I was in a cubicle with a curtain around me and the sister came over to me and told me my son had passed away. I didn\u0027t know the details but Dr Laxman came to see me and the baby\u0027s father was there. Dr Laxman sat on the side of my bed and she said how sorry she was for what happened but I didn\u0027t know the full extent of what happened at that point. I just said \u0027it\u0027s alright, these things happen, I forgive you\u0027. She went away but I started screaming when I found out the full extent - I was just crying. I was upset because of the severity of his injury. I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.  Midwife Mona Chard said: I was aware she had palpable tightening and some bleeding and she was moved to the labour suite. There was a lot of discussion but I\u0027m not sure who was talking to who. I can\u0027t remember Dr Laxman having a conversation with a patient. I was trying to reassure the patient and comfort her. I remember looking round and people were shocked. The doctor came over to me and said Dr Laxman had decided there wasn\u0027t going to be a C-section and I saw her pull the baby\u0027s feet and cord and she told the patient to push. That is something you cannot forget and Patient A was very distressed. The hearing was told the woman was given cocodamol before she was examined and Dr Laxman decided on a natural delivery. Lawyer for the General Medical Council, Charles Garside QC, said: They tried to coerce the birth through traction as the baby was coming feet first followed by the lower abdomen, upper abdomen and head. However, there was an obstruction during the birth which proved to be fatal. Dr Laxman allegedly delivered the legs, torso and arms successfully but whilst trying to deliver the head, it got stuck in the cervix. The attempt to manipulate the baby\u0027s head to come out of the cervix failed because the cervix has clamped onto the baby\u0027s head and despite effort made to assist, these efforts failed. Dr Laxman made three attempts to cut the cervix with scissors but Baby B\u0027s head was separated from his body and his head was stuck inside Patient A\u0027s body. The doctors had to arrange for the head to be removed. A Caesarean was then carried out - not by Dr Laxman who had become overcome by events - but by Dr C and Dr D, and his head was removed in that way. As a matter of compassion the head was reattached so the appearance of the baby was not too extreme. The baby was shown to his mother so she had the consolation of seeing him.

Ron Tucker, who died at the age of 92, was just 16 when he joined up in 1942, hiding his real age to serve his country. He volunteered for the new Parachute Regiment and, at 18, fought as part of the 9th Parachute Battalion in the D-Day landings. Shot four times, he carried on fighting and returned to the frontline. At his funeral at St Barnabas Church in his hometown of Middlesbrough today, Ron’s coffin was draped in the Union flag, with his Paras beret and badge on top.  Fifty veterans formed a guard of honour as one of their own was piped into the church through the raised flags of Parachute Regimental Associations. Rev Sam Tyndall told mourners that Ron was among the first members of the Airborne Division, the last D-Day veteran from their ranks on Teesside. Carl McGee, 44, who served in the Parachute Regiment from 1996 to 2010, said: “Many people in life have a hero to look up to. I was fortunate enough to have Ron Tucker. He was a true friend. “But most of all he was the beginnings of the regiment in which I had pleasure to serve. He was a man who loved and was, in turn, loved by anyone who ever met him. A true Airborne warrior.”  Rev Tyndall described Ron, who was a devoted husband to wife Dorothy and father to Peter and Ann, as a courageous man “right to the end”, a man with a big heart who loved his family very much. He added: “Ron fought for good.” In his memoir A Teenager’s War, Ron had told how his life was saved when one of four machine gun bullets that ripped through his uniform and pack hit a crucifix in his breast pocket. The bullet splintered on impact, narrowly missing two grenades. It was one of several lucky escapes for Ron, who was accompanied by the Daily Mirror when he made a pilgrimage to Normandy to remember his fallen comrades four years ago. Of the 450 Paras dropped into the Ranville area, only 150 survived and just 65 made it back home at the end of the war. In his book, Ron also told how he had dashed for cover as German troops ran to examine his parachute on D-Day. He recalled: “One had his jackboot so close to my nose I could smell the oily leather.” He pulled the pin of a grenade in readiness but the Germans moved off. Ron was awarded France’s highest medal, the Legion d’Honneur, for his heroics on D-Day and for his part in the Allied push to Berlin from 1944-1945. Before a bugler played Last Post from a gallery yesterday, ex-Para Joe Corfield, 80, told how his friend Ron had seen “more action than most of us put together”. He added: “He was a stunning, exceptional man, an inspiration.” By Jeremy Armstrong Tributes were paid today to a D-Day veteran whose friends had mistakenly attended his “funeral” 13 years ago. Former colleagues of Frank Hughes, 92, (pictured) turned up at the service for a namesake after a death notice appeared in 2005. Not long afterwards, one startled funeral-goer spotted Frank strolling around his hometown, Darlington, Co Durham. Born in Skegness, Frank enlisted at 18 and took part in the Juno beach landings of June 1944, helping hundreds of Canadian troops on to the beaches.   The father-of-two, who died earlier this week, once recalled: “All those young men who sacrificed everything for us.  We must always remember them.” After the war, Frank was in the Salvation Army, the fire brigade and drove an ambulance. In 2015, he received the Legion D’Honneur. His family said: “He will be greatly missed.” Details of the funeral are to be confirmed."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage girl sister mum plotted","story":"NewsTeenage girl, sister and mum \u0027plotted Britain\u0027s first all-female ISIS terror attack on British Museum using grenades or guns\u0027A court heard how Safaa Boular, 18 - allegedly encouraged by her mother and sister - \u0027wanted to be reunited with her fiancé in paradise by becoming a martyr\u0027\u0026nbspShareByToby Meyjes14:42, 10 MAY 2018Updated14:53, 10 MAY 2018NewsSafaa Boular (left) plotted to carry out a terror attack at the British Museum (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teenager plotted to carry out a terror attack at the British Museum after she was stopped joining her Islamic State fighter fianc\u0026eacute in Syria, a court heard. Safaa Boular, 18, planned an ambush using grenades or guns, and was told by her partner all she would need was a car and a knife, jurors were told. But she was thwarted after being remanded in custody in April last year for trying to reach Syria in 2016, it was said. Instead, she encouraged her sister Rizlaine Boular, 21, to carry out a knife attack in Westminster in order to “carry the torch forward”, the Old Bailey heard. Duncan Atkinson QC, prosecuting, said: “Although her plans, and the focus of her practical energies evolved over a period of time, her resolve to engage in violence in support of the cause of ISIS, first in Syria and then, when thwarted in that regard, in the United Kingdom remained unswerving.  “Even after she was arrested, that resolve remained, as is all too clearly demonstrated by her encouragement of a similar resolve on the part of her elder sister, Rizlaine Boular.” She allegedly planned to travel to Syria to support and marry Naweed Hussain, an IS fighter in Raqqa. They had never met face to face but had spoken via social media, and by August 2016 had been speaking for two to three months, it was said. The prosecutor said: “They had declared their love for each other and resolved to marry and to have children together.” Jurors heard she planned by August 2016 to go to Syria, not just to meet Hussain but to join IS and “offer her services, together with her life”. They allegedly planned for her to support him in Syria. Mr Atkinson said: “This support, as they planned it, would extend to each of them donning a suicide belt.  “Their plan, then, was that together they would, as Mr Hussain put it, depart the world holding hands, and taking others with them in an act of terrorism. “This was not just empty chat. “Safaa Boular told the police when they interviewed her in 2016 that the idea of undertaking a suicide mission appealed to her, a view more than borne out by materials then stored on her media devices.” She acquired much of the material before she started speaking to Hussain, and had been in contact with others in Syria earlier, it was said. In August 2016 she prepared to depart for Syria with her sister Rizlaine, who had tried to go there herself “with a similar end in view” two years before, the court heard. Rizlaine had been sent money by Hussain to finance their trip, her travel plans were made and her departure was “imminent”, it was said. After Safaa’s alleged plan was uncovered she was interviewed by the police in August, October and November 2016. But “undeterred”, she remained in contact with Hussain using a new secret phone and the encrypted app Telegram, it was said. By the end of 2016, Security Services had deployed a “specially trained role player” to speak to Hussain to discover his plans.  Similar “role players” spoke to Boular, particularly after Hussain was killed on April 4 2017. Both believed they were talking to people “who shared their warped aims and objectives, rather than persons dedicated to thwarting their murderous plans”, the prosecutor said. Mr Atkinson said: “It was clear that Hussain had been planning an act of terrorism with Safaa Boular, in which she could engage if she remained in this country. “Both Hussain and Safaa Boular talked of a planned ambush involving grenades and or firearms.” Boular allegedly told the role player, believing them to be an IS fighter, that Hussain said all she would need would be a “car and a knife to get what I want to achieve”. Mr Atkinson said: “Based on her preparation and discussion, it appears she planned to launch an attack against members of the public, selected largely at random, in the environs of that cultural jewel and most popular of tourist attractions, the British Museum, in central London. “This would have been an attack that would at the very least have caused widespread panic, but was intended to involve the infliction of serious injury and death.” While Hussain had “undoubtedly done much to encourage” her, the intention underlying those plans was always her own, the prosecutor said. He added: “She was encouraged, but she was willing. She was supported, but she was resolute.” Her determination was strengthened after learning Hussain had been killed, the court heard. The prosecutor said: “With positive encouragement from her mother and her sister, Rizlaine, Safaa Boular wanted to be reunited with her fianc\u0026eacute in paradise by becoming a martyr.” On April 12 2017 she was charged over her plan to travel to Syria and was no longer at liberty “to put her chilling intentions into practice herself”, the court was told.

Muhammad Durrani, 38, attacked the 27-year-old in July last year after driving her home alone from a night out with friends in London. Judge David Tomlinson described the damage Durrani had inflicted on his victim as he sentenced the married man at Southwark Crown Court on Thursday. It comes as no surprise to learn, and it\u0027s no exaggeration to say, you have ruined her life, the judge said. The harm you did that night is incalculable.  He added he had no doubt Durrani was aware his victim was almost paralytically drunk when he picked her up. Durrani lost all sense of self-control after taking pictures of the woman as she slept in the back of his car, the judge said. His victim had ordered an Uber with a friend\u0027s help, believing it to be a reputable company and fell asleep during the ride, according to the prosecution. Disorientated at her doorstep, she struggled to find her keys before Durrani carried her back to his car where he committed the rape. He then took selfie images with the woman as at least one of her breasts was exposed. Durrani, of Oakdale Road, Streatham, claimed the sex was consensual and denied one count of rape and one of assault by penetration, but a jury found him guilty of both. Wearing a brown cardigan, he remained solemn as he was sentenced but his wife struggled to hold back tears in the public gallery.

I love you to bits”: Karen Matthews reunites with former neighbour who helped jail herEXCLUSIVE: Former neighbour Julie Bushby, 48, came face to face with Matthews during a Bank Holiday reunion this week\u0026nbspShareByLucy Thornton22:12, 9 MAY 2018Updated07:52, 10 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen Karen Matthews came face to face with the woman who helped police put her behind bars, it was bound to be an emotional encounter. And former neighbour Julie Bushby, 48, did get a punch during their Bank Holiday reunion this week – a playful one on her arm as the pair bantered. Matthews, 43, told her: “I don’t hate you. You weren’t lying, just saying it as it was. In fact, I love you to bits.” Julie helped to get Matthews to confess to her part in daughter Shannon’s 2008 disappearance. She was in a police car with her, officer Christine Freeman and her pal Natalie Brown when the shamed mum admitted what she knew. Julie, a former chairman of the \u0026shyresidents association where the pair lived in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorks, then gave evidence against her at her trial – and the judge praised her for her honesty.  As Matthews, who served four years of an eight-year jail sentence, met her in a park at the weekend, she said: “She’s been my friend from day one and she’s the only one who didn’t betray me when others did. I don’t hate her at all for it. “She just did what Julie does, she was straight and honest.” Reviled Matthews spoke to the Mirror this week in a bid to prove to the nation that she is not evil.  She even offered to take a lie detector test about what happened to Shannon, who was found tied to a bed at accomplice Michael Donovan’s flat after a month-long search. Yet Matthews still denies her part in the sickening kidnap plot to cash in on the \u0026pound50,000 reward money. And pointing to other vile criminals, the mum-of-seven claims she was made a “scapegoat”, saying: “I’m not Britain’s worst mum. I didn’t kill anybody. Baby P’s mum and Maxine Carr don’t get the abuse I do.” Matthews did not recognise Julie until she said in her broad Yorkshire accent: “Hello, stranger.” Meeting at a secret location in the southern town she now lives in, Matthews told Julie: “It’s weird seeing you, it’s strange. But I’ve missed you.” The pair hugged before Julie, in her typical no-nonsense manner, challenged Matthews over fresh allegations about her having a 72-year-old sugar daddy and ripping off homeless people – which she denies. Julie teased: “So what’s this about you sh*gging an old man? You like them older, Karen, don’t ya! D’ya remember when you went out with [names a man], he was in his 60s or 70s.”  “I don’t remember him,” Matthews said, looking outraged. “But none of it’s true, Julie. He’s just a friend from work and I’m just so lonely and he was somebody to talk to. He’s nice to me.” She grimaced and pretended to be sick when asked if she had slept with him, saying: “I’m not interested in men at all. And I wouldn’t con homeless people. I’ve got a good heart really.” Leaving the park, the pair browsed charity shops together and popped into Poundstretcher. As they took a pleasure boat trip, Matthews waved to Bank Holiday sunbathers on the river bank while discussing her trial and catching up with gossip from her former home. Matthews told how she had never been on a boat before and Julie joked: “It’s all right, it might be your first and last time. I might throw you overboard!” Julie had to apologise frequently for forgetting to call Matthews by her new name, with the disgraced mum \u0026shyrepeatedly saying: “I don’t know her.” Matthews talked about her hobbies and told Julie how she enjoyed playing a colour by numbers game on her phone.  Julie laughed and said: “Anybody can colour in f***ing boxes, you want to try the real cross stitch. It’s very therapeutic.” As they passed luxurious back gardens along the river, Matthews said: “I wouldn’t like to live there, you’d have to fence it all off to keep the kids safe.” Julie, who was portrayed by Sheridan Smith in The Moorside, asked if Matthews had watched the hit BBC drama. “I did see bits of it but I didn’t like how they played me,” she said. She then added with a giggle: “But I thought that woman played you real good, Julie.” However, her smile vanished when the chat became more serious. Matthews told of her regrets at having missed her brother’s funeral because she was in jail, and her dad’s last year. And of mum June, who lives alone in West Yorkshire, she said: “She was a good mum, she did her best but we’re not in touch.” As the talk returned to her trial over Shannon’s kidnap, she said: “When they said ‘guilty’ to me in court, I was confused because I’d pleaded ‘not guilty!’. I hated sitting next to him [co-defendant Michael Donovan] in court. And then I got the same sentence as him and he’d drugged her. How can that happen?” Asked if she misses Dewsbury, she said: “I wouldn’t go back to Dewsbury, there’s nothing for me there... only Julie.” Julie laughed and said: “That’s all right, ’cos Dewsbury wouldn’t have you back anyway!” Mum-of-three Julie, who has seven grandchildren, is still living on the \u0026shyMoorside estate. She and Matthews were not best friends before Shannon vanished but knew each other and were at the same parenting classes. When Shannon went missing, Julie was one of the first people to offer help – organising the search, handing out posters and gathering people for candlelit vigils.

Or, you could try to recreate the McDonald\u0027s goodness in your own home .  While this may sound laborious, one woman has shown that it\u0027s completely possible - and the results can be just as delicious. Home-made Chicken McNuggets with that sweet and sour sauce.   Perth-based high school teacher, Bernadette, shared her wisdom on the Facebook group Homemade McDonald\u0027s.  So successful were nuggets, that she\u0027s since got rave reviews. Last night I challenged myself to create what some in this group had attempted but never seemed to nail - the iconic 6 pack o\u0027 nuggs and sweet and sour dipping sauce, she wrote. Here\u0027s how she did it.  For the nuggets, she triple-coated a chicken breast in a zip lock bag of flour with salt, vegeta (stock powder), garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper with an intermittent egg wash. Next - and this could be the secret - she put them in a freezer between the second and third coats to ensure crispiness a la OG. As for the sweet and sour sauce, this was the part Bernadette felt a little nervous about, adding: I really didn\u0027t think this was gonna be possible to replicate at home but I came pretty damn close.  To create this, she put apricot jam, garlic powder, onion powder, soy sauce, mustard, white wine vinegar, glucose syrup and cornstarch in a food mixer and blitzed them. She then reduced them over a gentle simmer. As for the results, Bernadette awarded herself 9/10. Apparently she would have scored higher, but apparently the nuggets had too much flavour.

The appalling story made headlines around the globe after the children\u0027s parents were arrested. But what happened to the family since January? Parents Louise and David Turpin are now facing 42 charges including torture, false imprisonment and child abuse after allegedly shackling their children to a bed in California. The pair are accused of subjecting their brood to frequent beatings and even strangulation over the decades they were kept locked up in filthy conditions. The children had so little contact with the outside world, one reportedly didn\u0027t know what a police officer was.  When officers discovered their filthy living conditions at their home in Perris, in January this year, they were horrified. David Turpin 57, and Louise Turpin, 49, began tying the children up as a punishment many years ago, according to prosecutors. It allegedly began with one of the boys being tied to the bed with rope, but when he escaped they started using padlocks and chains to control their children. What happened to the Turpin children?  Police discovered the Turpin children living in horrifying conditions, with three children chained to a bed in Perris, California. The horrifying scenes were uncovered in January when one of the 13 children, aged 17, escaped before making a desperate bid to inform someone of the siblings left locked up. Seven of the Turpin\u0027s 12 remaining children in captivity were adults, with all their ages ranging from two to 29. The conditions in the filthy four-bedroom Perris home were said to be dark and foul smelling and the children and young adults were malnourished and dirty after years of captivity. District Attorney Mike Hestrin said: All 13 of the victims and defendants would typically sleep all day and be up through the night.  Starting many years ago, the victims would be tied up as punishment. These punishments would last for weeks or even months at a time. Police arrested both parents who are facing a total of 42 charges with a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 20. Several of the children were said to have cognitive impairment and nerve damage from extreme and prolonged physical abuse. Attorney Mike Hestrin added: None of victims were allowed to shower more than once a year. What happened to the children after their rescue?  Following their rescue, the children were taken to a police station where they were given food and drinks after they told officers they were starving. They were then taken to different hospitals for treatment and to be given to chance to wash. Police said the parents “were unable to immediately provide a logical reason why their children were restrained in that manner. After recovering in hospital, CNN reported the children are now happy living in three separate homes in Riverside County. Six of the children are minors and seven are adults.  The adults spent time in recovery at the Corona Regional Medical Centre hospital for two months. The centre\u0027s CEO Mark Uffer spoke about the moment they left hospital, saying There were some tears flowing, both for the staff and the Turpin children, he said. They said they loved us, they were going to miss us, they hoped to see us soon., reports CNN . All seven adults are now living in a home together. Two of the youngest children were put into foster care, while the remaining four are at another home after authorities struggled to find accommodation for all six together. The children are reportedly regularly in touch via Skype. How were the children discovered?  The children were discovered when a 17-year-old girl plotted her escape alongside others help in captivity. Early one Sunday morning, she climbed out of a window with a one of the younger children, before the younger child became frightened and turned back. The teenager managed to alert police by that 12 of her siblings remained in captivity. She used a deactivated mobile phone to call 911. Police at the time mistook her for a child aged around 10 due to her severe malnourishment. When police arrived at the house, it was reported the Turpins desperately attempted to untie two children shackled up at the time. The parents were immediately arrested.

We just need to concentrate on ourselves.“We’re in a better position than Ross County and Partick so it’s still in our hands.With striker Sofien Moussa a doubt for the Premiership fixture lunchtime fixture, Murray could be deployed in a central attacking role rather than out wide – where he has played in recent weeks.Murray says he is comfortable with that and ready to start firing again after a sticky spell in front of goal, saying: “I’m happy to play anywhere but, obviously, I’m a striker and I want to be in the box through the middle.“Hopefully, I can get the nod and whether it’s up on my own or with a partner I’m happy to be out there.“The most important thing is to play well and get the result.“I’ve been creating chances and getting my shots off, whether the keepers have been saving them or I’ve been missing the target, I’ve been getting into the areas and I felt like some of my performances are just missing a goal now.“I feel like I’ve been playing well but just not getting the goal.

However, six months later he is still waiting for a transplant.People on the transplant list can be contacted at any time to say there is an organ available for them — and Nadir was ecstatic when he received a call to say a potential donor kidney had been found.However, his joy turned to agony when he awoke from the anaesthetic to find that doctors had cancelled the operation because the donor kidney had been damaged.He said: “We drove down to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and I was obviously really nervous. They put me on dialysis and told me surgery would be around 8am.“I was taken off dialysis at 11pm and went back to my bed. My parents were staying in accommodation provided by the hospital.“I couldn’t sleep until about 5am because I was so nervous and excited.“The surgeon visited me an hour before the operation and told me the kidney wasn’t a perfect match but it was still pretty good.“He asked me formally if I wanted to go ahead. I was wheeled into the operating theatre and they put me under anaesthetic. I went under thinking, ‘this is it’.“They woke me up two hours later and a nurse told me that the operation didn’t go ahead because the kidney was damaged.“They took me back up to the ward and I was being sick along the way because I was still under the influence of the anaesthetic.“I was upset when I woke up properly and they said I could stay the night but I just went home as soon as I could since I really didn’t want to stay there after what had happened.“I was really upset on the way home but I tried not to show it.”Anyone willing to be tested to see if they are a match to donate an organ to Nadir can contact a living donation co-ordinator at Ninewells Hospital on 01382 633897 or email robbie.paul@nhs.net.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/31956475_10215998158964634_3954302893946830848_n-e1525777205756-403x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people are you heading to the linlathen high school reunion in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRemember the \u0026#8220rocket\u0026#8221 at Linlathen High School?

still rolling on.“We wanted to do it off our own back, under our own steam and win the game.“I felt Ross County were the better side in the first 20 minutes, we started getting our foot on the ball

You don’t get many of those boys to the pound.”\u0026mdash Hamilton Accies FC (@acciesfc) May 6, 2018\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/ohara-collage-940x564.jpg ","title":"toothless mark ohara epitomises dundees spirit says boss mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann praised midfielder Mark O’Hara after he went off at half-time in their 1-0 win over Hamilton missing his two front teeth.The 22-year-old felt the full force of an aerial collision with Accies’ Danny Redmond after 10 minutes but powered through to complete the first 45.He was replaced by Lewis Spence at the break after Kevin Holt had given the Dark Blues a 1-0 first-half lead with a powerful strike.Elliott Parish saved an 86th-minute Dougie Imrie penalty to secure the three points and all-but guarantee Premiership safety for another season.It was a collective effort which saw the Dee over the line but Neil took the time to single out O’Hara for his battling performance in the team display.“He was immense on Saturday but I have to compliment the whole team, they pulled together,” he said.“He’s not looking too bonnie and he’s not speaking too well either, he’s lost his two front teeth.“I think the groundsman found one of them, not sure if he’s got his second one yet but I thought it was a heroic performance to make it through 45 minutes because his face wasn’t great.“The big fella dug in because there were a few headers where I didn’t think he would fancy it but he did.“He was feeling a bit light-headed at half-time so we had to change him but I’m hoping that we can get him to a dentist and get him sorted out.“He’s a bit sore and was just one of the heroes on Saturday in what was a big performance.”Going into tomorrow’s contest with Ross County in Dingwall, Dundee cannot be automatically relegated as they sit eight points clear of their Highland rivals. However, they are not mathematically safe from falling into the play-off spot which Partick Thistle currently occupy.The Dee host Thistle in the last game of the season and are currently six ahead with a better goal difference – meaning they are practically safe. However, Neil is not taking anything for granted.He added: “Clearly we’re safe from the automatic spot but there’s still work to be done. We’ve put ourselves in a really good position.“You can’t be too complacent, you can’t take anything for granted.”\t\t\t"}]
