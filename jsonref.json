Around is ex-industry awaiting regeneration. Diggers are clawing at the bulky wreck of a nearby decommissioned waste-to-energy power station, its replacement being housed inside the aforesaid aluminium-clad and concrete-framed alp.Below you a slice of replica Swiss meadow swoops steeply down, then veers left and out of sight. Its grass grows through a green plastic mesh, the brush-like finish of which gives the same coefficient of friction as snow. Which means you can ski down it, even when it’s verdant. Knobbly concrete tracks, for people who like running up and down mountains, wind through vegetation, with flues and extracts popping up here and there. An external climbing wall rises the full height of the main structure. A glass-walled lift, for those who like to take the easier route to the top, offers glimpses of mighty machines inside.This is the long-awaited £485m Amager Resource Centre (ARC) by the architects Bjarke Ingels Group, or BIG. It’s a work that revels in its own contrivance, a condensation and celebration of the surrounding artifice, a creation of what might be called hypernature. It is at once an energy facility, converting refuse into electricity, and a ski slope. It is arresting and striking. It’s an emblem of a culture of why-not and because-you-can that currently pops up in a number of modern cities: twisting towers in Toronto by the Chinese practice MAD the Dubai palm-islands and sail-shaped hotels that are by now almost historic.ARC has been a signature dish of Bjarke Ingels, ever since BIG won the project in a competition in 2010, its virtual image consumable online, in publications, in TED talks. It was, said Architectural Digest, one of the most anticipated buildings of 2018. It is not entirely finished even now, but it did start generating power last year and it was officially opened to the public last week.Over the same period Ingels, now aged 45, has risen from noisy upstart to global brand, presiding over an empire of about 550 employees in offices in Copenhagen, New York, London and Barcelona. He is designing, in collaboration with Thomas Heatherwick, headquarters for Google in both London and Silicon Valley. He operates with a kind of genius in the intersection between architecture and PR, interviewed times without number, offering memorable morsels to the maw of social media. He does audacity. He does wit. He does projects-with-a-twist – a habitable warped pyramid on Manhattan, for example. They are multistorey haikus, likes-factories, machines for generating “aha” moments in their viewers, journalistic readymades.He learned the power of shock from his former boss, Rem Koolhaas, without the scent of intellectual and psychological complication that major clients sometimes find off-putting about the latter. He presents himself as a seer, intoning about the future he means to shape, about the “world-changing power of form-giving”, but a cheeky one.In Formgiving, an exhibition on BIG at the Danish Architecture Centre, you are greeted on the stairs by a life-size talking image of the spiky-haired Ingels, who somewhat portentously situates BIG’s work in the context of both the big bang and the singularity that will end the universe. But the pomp is then knowingly deflated by a room full of models created by AFOL (Adult Fans of Lego), who have ingeniously replicated BIG’s buildings with the renowned child’s brick.He is a sort of anti-Dane, an exception to the Scandinavian rule of not talking yourself up, his rambunctious architectural style the opposite of the careful tending of timber and daylight that characterised Danish modernism. At the same time he has latterly acquired an attraction to Danish icons – in 2017 he completed a building for Lego that looked like giant Lego, and he has recently finished a new home for the world-famous restaurant Noma. His Copenhagen office is in an old factory that used to make bottle tops for Carlsberg. I am told that the best thing he did for his standing in his homeland was to start living in New York: it turned him from a troublesome boat-rocker to a treasured export.ARC is bidding to be another icon, a post-industrial Little Mermaid, its form even having something of her statue’s upward twist from kneeling to vertical. Probably the best power-station-cum-ski-slope in the world, you might say. There’s every reason to think it will succeed. It’s an appealing idea realised with a pithy composition, a wedge clad in aluminium boxes that look like shiny giant bricks, surmounted by a tall grey cylinder of a chimney. This does not, as Ingels used to promise it would, blow smoke rings into the air – it turns out that this would require a quantity of vapour at odds with the plant’s environmental aspirations – but it is still a memorable object.The power station is also rooted in a kind of logic. The client’s ambition, at the time of the design competition, was to make the plant accessible to the public, which could easily have meant a somewhat generic rooftop garden. BIG wanted to create a place to which people would keep returning. They noticed other activities that had grown up in the half-abandoned surroundings go-karting, a park for cable-towed water-skiers. They noted that Danes will travel a long way to ski.They also noted that the processes of the plant, from trucks delivering waste, to the turbines, to the treatment of gases, require spaces that ascend from low to high, which can therefore be arranged under a slope. They then developed these concepts into the design of a building, with the help of a few more tactical decisions – the choice of cladding, for example, is to unify what is a disparate concrete construction underneath, sometimes solid and sometimes open. And so, with a kind of theatrical functionalism, a creative algebra of A+B+C  Z, they came up with the solution now on the Copenhagen skyline.The quibble with BIG is that they can be bit flashy and a bit trashy, that a slick gimmick is not enough to sustain the sometimes rather large zones of city life that they now create, that the charm of the big idea is not followed through into the detail. There’s a rough-and-ready feel to ARC, plus the impression that, with its delayed openings, its realisation was less smooth than its conception. Then again, this is a work well matched to its architects’ strengths.Nicety is not really the thing in this robust location a compelling idea is. Plus a dollop of chutzpah. Subject to caveats on questions that will only become clear in use – that it really works well as both ski slope and power station – this is one project that lives up to the hype."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace803944f04721bba6adefb89e05c2459ecb7cc/0_2817_3464_2079/master/3464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1eeb47a558ffee9a1145d271a640c49a","title":"big picture boy with balloons david alan harvey","story":"David Alan Harvey’s photograph of a boy with balloons on a street in Santiago, Chile, was taken in 1997.

The current volume pays homage to Cartier-Bresson’s black-and-white “decisive moments” and examines the way that that spirit has been taken forward, particularly after advances in digital photography and printing enabled a revolution in colour in the 1980s.Harvey was elected into the agency – there is a voting process among the membership – in the year that this picture was taken. By then, as a staff photographer for National Geographic, he had been taking pictures for more than three decades. A principle subject was the Hiic diaspora on both sides of the Atlantic – the “ided soul”, as he terms it, of Latin culture.Harvey traces his vocation back to a long period of isolated convalescence he endured as a child after contracting polio. His ward had a single window, which he stared out of for several months he came to understand it as his viewfinder. Taking that small square out with him into the world, his pictures, as here, are often concerned with little poetic moments of contradiction and the subtleties of framing. The horizontal planes of the parked cars on the tarmac are counterpointed with the airiness and rainbow colours of the balloons rising beyond the frame. The boy’s eyes catch those of the photographer, as if aware of the earthbound incongruities of his situation, ready for lift off.Magnum Streetwise is out on Thursday (Thames \u0026amp Hudson, £28)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee1ddcc554ee3666ca58e6750c8fb0b91109f822/0_225_4578_2747/master/4578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6f9e47af29aa1447302d293f4169847","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Protests in Hong Kong, Paris fashion week and Dina Asher-Smith at the World Athletics Championships – the past seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34e34309280e3727a6680b804d8bd37703802216/0_1196_3850_2308/master/3850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=179c5e002a96679c426dc5add907e6dc","title":"original observer photography","story":"Reportage from Angola, Gaza City and Sicily, portraits of Jonathan Van Ness, Gillian Anderson and Renée Zellweger – the best photography commissioned by the Observer in September 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/817e21d244f37411c1c6e03de31e839b33177056/0_1646_1998_1198/master/1998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba470575548dd7decc6e28eeedb03fa1","title":"the art of radiohead sleeve designer stanley donwood in pictures","story":"Bath-based artist Stanley Donwood is well known to Radiohead fans as the man behind the band’s album artwork.

I’ve just received the advance copies of my new book about Philip Larkin, called Somewhere Becoming Rain. Holding it up to be observed at various angles, I gloat audibly. On a less self-involved note, I’ve just read Anne Applebaum’s Red Famine. Her clarity reminds me of Olivia Manning.The book that changed my lifeLucky Jim by Kingsley Amis. I can still quote whole scenes from it. I read it in my early 20s, still a bit young to have fully understood that a book can be simultaneously entertaining and serious. Abruptly I realised that it could be a possible aim, for a writer, to raise a serious point and a laugh along with it.The book I wish I’d writtenI won’t say that I wish I’d written Larkin’s poems because I remain endlessly glad that he did.The book that had the greatest influence on my writingSJ Perelman’s Westward Ha! I loved the sublime mixture of high style and low content and I thought: yeah, both those doors at once.The book I think is most underoverratedThere are paragraphs by Raymond Chandler that are underrated. But it’s an open question whether he wrote any underrated novels. The most overrated books almost all emerged simultaneously from a single genre: magic realism. I can’t stand it. I always found ordinary realism quite magic enough.The book that changed my mindGeorge Bernard Shaw, his preface to Saint Joan. Reading that wonderful stretch of prose started me on the road to a more human version of Christianity: a road I like to think that I am still pursuing.The last book that made me cryIt was 20 minutes ago when I was reading Larkin’s poem “To the Sea”. Sometimes I could swear his memories were mine. Although Australia and Britain have very different beaches, when he was near the sea he always thought it was his element.The last book that made me laughWhen Philip Roth died I started reading Portnoy’s Complaint again, looking for a quotable line, and couldn’t find one that wasn’t.The book I couldn’t finishI very rarely give up on a book that I’ve really started. Closing a book in disgust half way through the first paragraph doesn’t count.The book I’m most ashamed not to have readThat means nothing. I’ve read all the books I thought ought to be read. The books I haven’t read are the books I thought didn’t need to be read.My earliest reading memoryReading to myself, it was a Biggles book by WE Johns, but I can’t remember which one. Biggles Flies East? Biggles Flies West? Biggles Flies West was much better, incidentally. Long before that my mother used to read me The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám on the back verandah of our house in Kogarah. She had a natural sense of rhythm, which became a model for the rest of my life as a performer.My comfort readThat’s not a concept that I’m familiar with. If reading didn’t make me uncomfortable in one way or another, it would just send me to sleep. I get comfort in other ways. I once wrote a poem called “The Book of My Enemy Has Been Remaindered”. I’m afraid I still get a big bang out of seeing the books of my rivals being utterly ignored.The book I give as a giftLarkin again: The Whitsun Weddings.The book I’d most like to be remembered forSince by definition the world will have to still be here in order for anyone to remember my book Cultural Amnesia, then that’s the one. EP Thompson talked about history rescuing the past from the “enormous condescension of posterity”. Condescension towards the past has never been more enormous than it is now. My book not only says that we have to remember the past, it presumes that we will, so there is hope in it as well as a warning.• Somewhere Becoming Rain by Clive James is published by Picador (£12.99).

Her latest novel, Akin, is published by Picador. The Secret Commonwealth by Philip Pullman This is the book I’m looking forward to most. Right now I’m in the middle of reading my 12-year-old (while she KonMaris her drawers) the His Dark Materials trilogy, which is the work I always recommend to adults who “don’t read kids’ books”. I’m on my third go through this epic fantasy, and I’m still finding new riches in it. When I heard Pullman was bringing back his most famous character Lyra (as a baby!) in La Belle Sauvage I must admit I cringed – but the book was brilliant, so I can’t wait to see what he does with an adult Lyra in The Secret Commonwealth.In 1990, I came across Helena Whitbread’s I Know My Own Heart: The Diaries of Anne Lister 1791-1840 this uniquely cocky Regency Yorkshire diarist reached out of the past and yanked me in. My first nonfiction book, Passions Between Women, was a study of things Lister could plausibly have read in forming her lesbian identity. So Gentleman Jack was a drama series I’d waited nearly 30 years for, and I thought it couldn’t possibly live up to my hopes, but it outdid them. Sally Wainwright’s tough and witty writing, Suranne Jones’s stride and wink – and Anne Lister finally finds her public, two centuries on.Our family’s been lucky enough to spend two separate years in Nice, and in that whole shiny city the eatery we’re most nostalgic for is a tiny pizzeria, past the old port, called Les Amoureux. The owner is so firm about ingredients that he goes back to Italy weekly to buy them. Les Amoureux is up-to-date enough to serve pistachio pesto, but old-fashioned enough that only women get their pizzas served in a heart shape, and there’s a metal figurine of a hunchback by the door that you rub for good luck on your way out.I’m no clothes-hound but there is one brand that reliably makes me smile: I’m obsessed with Spanish make Desigual. I first encountered these colourfully patchworked creations (the name means “uneven” in Catalan) in the company’s home city, Barcelona. I avoid the ones with sappy English words on them, but the rest of their exuberant pieces give me joy. At last count I had four of their dramatic long jackets and seven of their punchily patterned black, white and red shift dresses.I couldn’t live without this app, which a film director recommended at a moment in my life when I had so many plates in the air that I had a sick sense I was about to drop them all.

The space allowed for the promenading crowd to be pressed into service as mobs, balloon-wranglers and dancers those of us who prefer to sit could watch the thrilling whirl of it all. Nicholas Hytner’s production took serious liberties (giving Oberon’s speeches to Titania and vice versa) in a Shakespearean comic spirit, and they paid off.

The mighty River Tay picks you up a mile or so from the city centre and gently guides you in as the rail bridge, one of the greatest feats of British engineering and design, stands to salute you.From a distance, its cityscape is easy on the eye as it rises from the riverfront, spreads out and comes to rest on a hill. Nature looked kindly on this place and, as if in gratitude, its citizens have since made a speciality of design, of bringing beauty to purpose.Yet visits to Dundee always seemed weighed down by other people’s prejudices. The buildings in this place always had a civic grandeur and those of us who lingered awhile after football matches at Dens Park and Tannadice were rewarded with fine taverns and a music scene that seemed to elude the radar of the metropolitan arbiters of cool.Like many of Britain’s great cities of industry beyond London, it suffered depression and neglect as Margaret Thatcher deemed them expendable in her quest to make Britain a satellite state of the global stock market. Bigger and more boisterous cities seemed able to absorb these challenges and even to imbue them with a grim charisma, but Dundee came to be typified by them. Edinburgh could camouflage its edgier neighbourhoods with the shallow glamour of its festivals, while Glasgow’s black humour and gifts of self-publicity rescued it from being disfigured by notoriety.The announcement that Dundee was embarking on one of Scotland’s most important cultural projects ever, the spectacular V\u0026ampA Dundee, delighted those of us who have long regarded this great city and its people with affection.A year on from its official opening, the vision of those who planned this eight-year undertaking has been rewarded with a steady flow of visitors that exceeded its expectations. The V\u0026ampA Dundee has been a success and the building itself has become one of Scotland’s most emblematic and instantly recognisable jewels.When you alight upon it, you immediately become aware of how it strengthens the city’s bonds with the waterfront on which it sits. Thus, the vision of its creator, the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, has been fulfilled. He said: “I saw a photograph of Scotland’s sea cliffs – it’s as if the earth and water had a long conversation and finally created this stunning shape. Seeing this picture, I thought, ‘Ah, this is the solution’.”It has also generated a magnificent recasting of the area around it that you must experience personally to appreciate its scale. Here, the limited size of Dundee is an advantage. A five-minute walk from the centre of the city takes you to the gardens that sit in front of the museum. The adjoining hotels and retail developments accord this a destination status that is vital for an economy long bereft of any economic stimulus.Last week, for the first time, I finally got to see for myself the Scottish design galleries that lie within Kuma’s sloping, twisting masterpiece. Beyond once choosing fonts and shaping text around pictures to make the pages of a newspaper, I have scant knowledge of the alchemy of design. If something is crafted sufficiently well to permit me to use it without endangering those around me then it’s already a work of some genius.Perhaps, then, I was always going to be easily pleased, but for what it’s worth I was enchanted by these collections. Here’s Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s celebrated Oak Room for Mrs Cranston’s Glasgow tea rooms. The fixtures and fittings were rescued before the building’s renovation in the 1970s and kept in storage. Now the glorious, original whole has been reconstructed to provide a majestic close-up of Mackintosh’s sacred genius with light and structure, here gift-wrapped in oak. This alone makes any visit worthwhile.Of course, there’s much more. Here’s Christopher Kane’s startlingly sensual dresses and the original Dennis the Menace artwork for DC Thomson’s comics. Over there is a three-minute film of modern and sustainable designs for living on the island of Skye and the stained-glass grandeur of Douglas Strachan, one of Europe’s finest masters of the art.Yet while the response from the public, the majority shareholders in this building and its contents, has been overwhelmingly positive, it has been met with a curled lip from the critics of polis. The cafe is too big, they declared you can see the metal staples holding the stone slabs together if you look very, very closely there are not enough exhibits the views aren’t great. There are plenty of viewing points and, the building itself being the principal exhibit, a wee alfresco promenade around it permits you to see the Tay in all its glory.One of the guiding purposes of V\u0026ampA Dundee was to connect the city to its waterfront and to make it not just a grand home for great art and design, but a place where the citizens of Dundee could come to relax and be at peace. Several visits are required to appreciate this collection more fully and the museum in which they are held. Beyond it there will always be Dundee itself, ever vibrant, warm and striving still to overcome the social problems that afflict other great cities. Dundonians deserved their museum and over time this building and its treasures will evolve uniquely to honour them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ae4fd5e2a35f173678c2ddfa102bfaec93d7ad7/522_167_2811_1687/master/2811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3318b7ddc1d9910fa7c57d8bff043348","title":"moria refugee camp lesbos traumatised children","story":"The dire conditions in this refugee camp in Greece give traumatised children little hope of healingAyesha is nine years old. As her father lays her down gently on a mattress at the clinic, the only perceptible sign of life is the slow movement of her ribcage as she breathes in and out. She otherwise remains almost motionless, in stark contrast to the other children who run around this Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) paediatric clinic by Moria camp.For two weeks now, Ayesha has not opened her eyes. She has not spoken. She has not walked. She has what the mental health team believe could be one of the first cases of resignation syndrome it has seen here.I’m in Lesbos researching the psychological effects of trauma in these children who have often fled violent conflict in their home countries, only to arrive at a squalid camp where conditions are chaotic and inhumane. I quickly realise that Ayesha’s state embodies what can happen when a child loses all hope.Resignation syndrome represents a state of extreme withdrawal that can last for months or even years and occurs in the context of severe psychological trauma. Hundreds of cases have been seen in Swedish refugee and asylum-seeking children, with others reported at Australia’s offshore immigration detention centre on Nauru. These children simply close their eyes and stop speaking, eating and drinking, their muscles wasting away. Children who were perfectly well weeks before need to be dressed in nappies and tube-fed. The prognosis is uncertain, but those who do recover often only do so when they and their family reach a place of stability, especially if their residency status becomes secure.In Ayesha, the condition did not emerge in the immediate aftermath of seeing her nine-year-old brother die just a few feet away in an Afghanistan bomb blast. It didn’t emerge during the subsequent excruciating surgeries on her right leg (a steel cage still encircles it) or even during the torturous boat crossing to seek refuge here. Until then, she continued to speak and eat. Instead, her father tells me, she fell into a catatonic state only weeks ago when a teenage boy was stabbed to death close to their tent.“There was blood and there were sirens,” he explains. “Everyone was shouting. She started screaming. But then suddenly she had no words.” Before the family left Afghanistan, he says, “she was naughty and she was sweet. She played with dolls, she loved parks and sightseeing.” Now she places her hands over her face each morning, perhaps too overwhelmed to contemplate her past, present, or future.Katrin Glatz Brubakk, a child psychologist and MSF’s mental health activity manager on Lesbos, says that children whose emotional regulation is damaged by trauma tend to behave in two ways here. Some, like Ayesha, turn inwards to a place of extreme isolation: “These children come here and expect safety and don’t find it, they perceive the world as a bad place, they withdraw from it.” But others act it out. “There is a two-year-old here who is not able to conceputalise it as self-harm as such, but he has no means and no support to regulate his feelings in any way. He and other children here bite and scratch themselves, they hit their heads against a wall until they bleed.”The situation is compounded by dire conditions at the camp. Children face a lack of food and shelter, regular schooling, and often family support – more than 1,000 child refugees and migrants in Greece now are unaccompanied, the highest figure since early 2016.During my week interviewing patients and families about their experiences at Moria, it is clear to me that there is little hope of healing until they can find a place to heal. Moria is not that place, nor are the other overcrowded, squalid camps of the Greek islands.There are 13,500 people living in Moria’s tents and shipping containers in an area that was barely designed for 3,000. People queue for hours to collect basic food items each day. Sexual assault is common, and of children, too. Oxfam reported earlier this year that as a result, “in a few extreme cases, women say they have resorted to wearing diapers at night to avoid having to go to the toilet after dark”. Last week, a fire broke out, killing at least one person.This is a place that can only compound psychological trauma, not soothe it. Until Ayesha and her family find a place of stability, it is likely she will remain withdrawn from the world. And as long as conditions remain as they are at Moria, I believe that it is inevitable that other children will face the same fate.Dr Jules Montague is a neurologist and author based in London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb6cb1559b1eb9bb52cf66543b382e0f6c30162/287_524_1987_1192/master/1987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e778943e66535470460d41a46dffb5f","title":"only one route out of brexit maze jeremy corbyn must lead way","story":"Brexit-weary as we are, we must gird ourselves for the most significant few weeks for Britain since the Second World War. The crises of our economy, our constitution, our political parties, our identity and even public truthfulness are finally coming to a head. We must save our country from the duplicitous clutches of a zealous nationalist right – and for that the array of opposition parties and independent MPs, with Labour necessarily at its heart, must act.There is only one way out of the maze. There must be a second referendum, with the facts laid out in the light of the lessons of the past three years. The seismic act of leaving the European Union, with its disastrous consequences, has to be reality-tested in a single-issue confirmatory vote. A general election, with its shopping list manifestos addressing multiple issues, can never provide either the clarity or legitimacy for addressing such a question, especially as it was a referendum that created the mess in the first place. Under Johnson’s already near-dead Brexit proposal, car companies will wind down their UK operations gradually under no deal, they will simply close or exit as just-in-time production becomes impossible. Similarly hit: pharma, biotech and aerospace. Even the buoyant service sector is being infected: the IHS Markit business confidence indicator last week fell below 50, foretelling recession in services next year.Overall, there can only be economic stagnation-cum-recession in 2020 and 2021 if there is no deal, in some sectors it will become a slump. The notion that slow-to-negotiate trade deals with Australia and the US will ride to the rescue is pure fantasy – the volume of trade is a fraction of that with the EU. The EU is an economic safe harbour. More than that. Britain is a European country with a European vocation. There is no deal better than the one we had, being full members of the EU.Early this week, Jeremy Corbyn needs to make a speech along these lines, setting out the economic realities, and call for an extension of article 50 long enough to hold a second referendum. Labour, he should say, will support a deal with the EU – or an article 50 extension – only if a referendum is held with Remain on the ballot. If Johnson fails to negotiate a deal with the European council on 17 and 18 October, there must be a vote of no confidence and a government of national unity (GNU) formed, which he will lead, whose sole remit will be to take the confirmatory referendum bill through the House of Commons. The GNU will pre-commit to make no new policy, except in emergency circumstances and then only after a pre-declared consultation process. It will be a caretaker, bridge government.The numbers could be there, if all the opposition forces find common purpose, since Johnson commands only 288 Tory votes and 10 DUP votes. The first precondition is that Corbyn must declare that his aim is a second referendum. Already Nicola Sturgeon and even Ken Clarke have said they would support such an interim, single-issue government. The sticking point then becomes Jo Swinson and the Liberal Democrats. So far, the consequence of Swinson’s earlier veto of Corbyn’s offer for a GNU plus a general election, from which she slightly backtracked, has been masked because there is nothing newly viable to veto. But once he has declared for a referendum, she must put any reserves aside and support the leader of the opposition who commands the bulk of the votes that will form the GNU. It is pure realpolitik. The national interest trumps everything and her support will trigger the momentum to create the interim government. She can turn from blocker to enabler.Yes, I know the anti-Corbyn criticisms – from both social media and in private exchanges with MPs. It is impossible to make common cause with someone who has so connived in antisemitism and been so consistently ambiguous over the EU. Don’t be fooled by his surface decency – he has unleashed the isive red guard outriders in Momentum on some of the best in the Labour party. And Andrew Fisher, his policy director, when resigning wrote about the “blizzard of lies and excuses” and lack of “human decency” at the top. Corbyn’s radical socialism is so beyond even normal radical leftism that he constitutes a public menace, reflected in personal poll ratings of minus 60.But... Corbyn is the leader of the opposition. If he is ready to commit to a second referendum along with the votes to make it happen, we must make common cause. Already, millions of lives have been blighted by Brexit there will be millions more. In life, we do not always choose our political bedfellows – we build coalitions of the willing. This is the transcendent issue of our times. Swinson should not only say yes, she should say publicly that if Corbyn moves she will back him.Once the referendum is won, which, given the polling numbers and gathering economic difficulties, is Remain’s to lose, the argument in the general election to follow will be how to reset British capitalism and society to address the scale of disaffection that fuelled the Leave vote. Then the Lib Dems can do battle with Corbyn – but from the security of being inside the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de541a25498636802a38cd5a558f5e0f32083b3f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3801115c398aa34b628fff57abd167eb","title":"head start the 10 best high street bags and hats for men in pictures","story":"Beanie or cap, backpack or tote: with a warm head and your stuff stowed in style, you’re good to go"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f91e4c16a7e245f3d6e44d65ab1c77934119d38/0_17_2222_1333/master/2222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b15cc8fe2598e1784dfe6a87d2196e4c","title":"black film remakes hollywood set it off house party","story":"With help from Issa Rae and LeBron James, the industry is remaking a slew of classics, including Set It Off and New Jack CityHollywood’s remake trend knows no limits.

House Party, meanwhile, featured a young, still relatively unknown Martin Lawrence (who went on to star in big-budget films such as Bad Boys and Big Momma’s House).“There were a lot of risks being taken back then,” said Danielle Scruggs, who runs Black Women Directors, a digital catalog of films made by black women. “The films weren’t as didactic as they are today. Like House Party: here’s two teens who just want to throw the best party of the year. It’s this slice-of-life film. There’s no one looking at the camera and saying: ‘Black Lives Matter!’”The forthcoming remake have black Hollywood’s brightest names attached. Issa Rae, star of the HBO sitcom Insecure, will reportedly produce Set It Off. The basketball star LeBron James will produce House Party through his new film and TV studio SpringHill Entertainment and the Black-ish creator, Kenya Barris, was hired in 2015 to pen a film version of the 70s sitcom Good Times. “A classic is something new that feels familiar,” said the music video director Calmatic, who is helming the House Party remake. “I think that’s the formula a lot of these new projects are working with. Creating a new energy around a familiar entity.”Calmatic’s childhood VHS collection, which included The Nutty Professor and Sister Act 2, highlights the importance of mainstream black films. “I haven’t even seen ‘classics’ like ET or Back to the Future,” the director of Lil Nas X’s music video Old Town Road said. “But what I do know are the two or three VHS tapes we had at my house. I watched Sister Act 2 a million times.”Hollywood is hoping to re-create some of this magic.A boom of black films gradually declined during the late 90s and early 2000s. Black directors’ projects were often spaced out years apart (John Singleton, the esteemed late director of Boyz In the Hood, once had a six-year hiatus) and studios invested little in their marketing. Eventually, the releases of black-centric films became special occasions.Warner Bros learned how not to repackage a popular black franchise this summer with its ill-received Shaft reboot. Starring Samuel L Jackson as Shaft, the film was seen as being too different from its critically lauded predecessors and failed to capture an audience. “It was a pretty big flop for Warner Bros,” Bock says. “But the failure of that movie is not going to stop other reboots from being made. Studios have learned it’s better to take something that’s not so beloved and can be improved upon. That’s when a reboot is successful.”There is the valid concern a heavy focus on remakes and reboots will devalue the original ideas of black screenwriters and directors. Would a major studio pass up on an experimental script like Jordan Peele’s racial horror satire Get Out in favor of something tried and tested?“I don’t really want to see reboots,” said Scruggs, followed by a groan. “There’s enough original ideas out there that haven’t been done before. I want to see those stories told, instead of looking at the past.”But the reboots trend is here, for black and white audiences now. As Bock said: “Anything nostalgic right now is gold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60fea53ff54eb3339e75a3383f598c804671c2f9/0_1091_5353_3210/master/5353.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00ea609cd3f4f79bae108e975993c52c","title":"nigel slater blackberry and apple recipes","story":"Two twists on a classic combination, one with pork crackling, one in a trifle‘Blackberry and apple’ is one the great culinary marriages. Stirring berries into clouds of soft, palest yellow apple is among the best of the season’s kitchen rituals. It’s an autumnal pairing that brings with it memories of country lanes and orchards, of bramble scratches and shinning up fruit trees. It is old china bowls of warm crumble and deep slices of purple pie. I have yet to meet two ingredients that sit so perfectly together.I don’t think it matters whether the apples are Bramleys or Golden Delicious, Worcesters or Brigadier. The blackberries could be wild or cultivated or from the freezer. But I’m not sure we should mess much with this particular partnership. A couple of cloves and a shake of cinnamon aside, this is not a lily that needs gilding, but it does deserve a more imaginative outing than to be covered by a pastry crust. It works especially well in savoury recipes – few things flatter a roast loin of pork so well. The sharp fruit purée is a good friend to the layers of quivering fat and crisp skin of the meat.Which brings me neatly to crackling and the joy of dipping jagged shards of the stuff, bronze and crisp, into a puddle of violet-streaked stewed apple and blackberry. It is something to cook from scratch or to do with the leftover roast, the golden carapace torn from the meat and sprinkled with salt. That dish of stewed fruit can also become a layer in a trifle, when the juices trickle down into the sponge cake beneath and mingle with walnut-hued sherry.Sealed, the pickled blackberries will keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks.pork skin and fat from the belly 1.25kgsea saltcooking apples 1 kgcaster sugar 1 tbspFor the pickled blackberries:red wine vinegar 150mlsoft brown sugar 75gyellow mustard seeds 1 tspsea salt ½ tspblackberries 250gTo make the pork crackling, score the skin, using a very sharp cook’s knife or box cutter, in long lines, 1-2 cm apart. Lay the skin on a wire cooling rack, rub generously with sea salt, pushing the grains right down into the score lines, then leave in a cool place for a minimum of 4 hours. Overnight will not hurt.To pickle the berries, put the red wine vinegar and soft brown sugar in a medium-sized stainless steel or enamelled pan and bring to the boil. Add the mustard seeds and sea salt. When the sugar has dissolved, cut each blackberry in half then add to the hot vinegar and sugar. Transfer fruit and liquor to a sterilised jar and seal.Set the oven at 230Cgas mark 8. Place the pork, skin side up and still on its rack, in a roasting tin, then roast for 20 minutes. Turn the heat down to 180Cgas mark 4 and leave for a further 20-30 minutes or until puffed, blistered and crisp. Remove and leave to cool.Peel the apples, quarter them and remove their cores then put them in a medium-sized saucepan with the caster sugar and 100ml of water. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat, cover with a lid, and leave at a light simmer for about 15 minutes until the apples have collapsed into a fluff. An occasional stir will stop them sticking. Transfer to a serving bowl. Crush the apples with a fork or vegetable masher.Break the crackling into small pieces and serve with the apple purée. Just before serving, stir some of the blackberries into the apple.If you get as far as putting the apple and blackberry layer in place then covering each one and refrigerating overnight, the trifles will be even better.apples 1 kglemon juice of 1caster sugar 2 tbspblackberries 250g, plus a few to decoratesponge cake 250goloroso sherry 8 tbspdouble cream 250gFor the custard:double cream 225mlcinnamon stick ½cloves 3nutmeg 1, for gratingegg yolks 4caster sugar 35gFirst make the custard.

Criminal, traffic and helicopter units, along with police on horseback, will be on duty for a match that has already drawn an appeal from the England manager, Gareth Southgate, for fans to be on their best behaviour.Police have vowed to show zero tolerance for violations of local laws, which limit the consumption of alcohol on the streets and demand quiet in neighbourhoods deemed residential after 10pm.The operation will be backed up by 11 British officers, the Czech Republic’s biggest deployment of foreign police agents for a match, as spotters responsible for identifying and communicating with troublesome English supporters.He added: “Prague is a very attractive city for away fans in terms of price of beer and by playing the fixture on Friday night it has a new dimension and becomes even more attractive. With such a big number of away fans, it is assumed that some misbehaviour may occur.”Most fans are expected to spend the weekend in Prague, putting an added burden on a city already struggling to cope with the effects of modern tourism, including a flourishing trade in organised pub crawls that have elicited complaints from local residents.Prague’s extensive surveillance camera system will be used to monitor fans’ behaviour away from the stadium, a city council spokesperson said.Security plans have been under way for months, with the Football Association, its Czech equivalent, the local municipality, the England supporters’ club and the British embassy in Prague all involved.The embassy’s consular section will be on standby for emergencies. It has prepared a video of dos and don’ts to be posted on Facebook and Twitter. Along with the supporters’ club, it is setting up a stall in the city centre to act as an information base.Some bar owners are taking contingency steps. O’Che’s Irish bar, in the historic old town district, will hire extra security guards to deal with potentially unruly fans. “We are not really worried, because we have English people every weekend,” said Jan, the bar’s manager, who declined to give his last name. “But we know that English fans can be completely crazy when they are angry. But it’s business and we’ll survive.”In that case, the police would be ready to use force, he said. “Visiting fans are more than welcome but if the situation is getting worse and needs an intervention of anti-riot units, we are ready to take action. I recommend to follow instructions given by the police in order to avoid any useless troubles such as paying a fine or being arrested.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/818ee76c533e541ca8392075e12d69eacc76431b/0_989_3912_2347/master/3912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c76564dff25e47c31ae127286903a357","title":"what are your views on modern masculinity","story":"For our second series about modern masculinity, we’d like to hear men’s views on fatherhood and getting older Earlier in the year we did a call out to  readers asking for your views on the issues affecting men which helped guide a series looking at modern masculinity in 2019.Your responses led us to address questions around role models, intergenerational relationships and even the popularity of Jordan Peterson, and we want to return with a second series, led by you, looking deeper into the areas that you want to see us addressing.We know about some of the issues that men are interested in discussing such as pornography, fatherhood and getting older, so we want to hear your views on those topics but we’d also like you to tell us what we should cover in the next series too.You can share your views in the encrypted form below, anonymously if you prefer.

I’m in my 50s now. I’ve never met my mother but, with the help of the adoption agency that forwarded my letters, she claimed that although they were in a relationship, my father raped her. I’ve been searching for him since my early 20s and had asked my mother for more information to find him. She refused. Last year I found him. We are now in regular contact. I haven’t told him that my mother said he raped her and then became pregnant. He is in his 80s and fragile. I worry what it would do to him. I think it’s a lie. He tells me how much they loved each other and he doesn’t understand why she broke off the relationship. I find it hard to live with her accusation and she refuses to have anything to do with me. She has done so much damage in her dealing with the whole matter, and this huge accusation. Is there anything I can do?Mariella replies Give her the benefit of the doubt? She may not appear to merit sympathy or understanding and she certainly hasn’t shown either in her dealings with you based on your longer description. Nevertheless, I’d caution you not to dismiss her story out of hand. I appreciate the matter has been handled clumsily and you must hurt deeply. It’s worth remembering that putting your baby up for adoption is far from the easy option. There’s every reason to assume it was an agonising time for her and, perhaps, your father, too.It’s natural to want to investigate your story, but as you’ve discovered it doesn’t always produce easy or even comprehensible answers. The past is a foreign country, they do things differently there, as LP Hartley famously wrote in The Go-Between. Having an illegitimate baby in the 1960s was not the acceptable choice it is today and we may never know how much your mother’s narrative was influenced by the society she lived in. Without access to her history you are working in the dark.Today’s prevalent culture when it comes to issues around sex and permission is to assume guilt until proven innocent, which is not the way our justice system is set up to work. There’s every reason to believe your mum’s account and, controversial though it might seem, the same expectation of veracity is due to your dad. Crime or no crime, when it comes to your conception it’s unlikely that it will be atoned for in their lifetimes. If your mother is telling the truth it might explain why she’s so furiously tried to keep you away from the man who violated her. If it’s just a story she’s invented to help assuage her feelings about having had you adopted that’s equally understandable, though not justified. I’m not sure you’ll ever be certain you have “the truth”. Memory is subjective, there are many blanks to be filled and most of us know that history is just a version of what occurred as seen from a particular vantage point. I know digging is an irresistible urge and can sometimes net great rewards, but there are times when you are left with the little you had spoiled or reduced by your discoveries.There’s not enough detail in your letter to know whether your father knew your mother was pregnant, and that’s a further layer to dig through. What is it that you want to know? If your father breaks down and admits your conception wasn’t consensual, will it change the relationship you’ve invested in? It will make him a rapist, but at this distance it may be hard not to keep loving him, so you’ll try to find other ways of excusing him based on your desire to remain close. If your mother’s account is true, will it alter the sense of abandonment you feel and that she’s done nothing to alleviate?You have had a lot of emotional damage to contend with and it’s common to start looking for answers to such conundrums in midlife. There is obviously an awful lot of pain, mistrust and potentially worse embedded in your parents’ liaison. Carrying the burden of that is a choice. The most rewarding thing to investigate here is your own motive in pursuing this story and the hopes you clearly carry for emotional reconciliation with at least one of your birth parents, and whether you can find the wherewithal to step beyond the shadow of the past and use those experiences to give you greater resilience in your own life. Dark corners are sometimes better undisturbed unless the benefit of illuminating them outweighs the destructive force of secrets revealed. I really can’t tell you whether or not you should hold your father to account. Your impulse to find a villain may backfire and your mother emerge as a traumatised survivor of a crime perpetrated by the frail man you now describe. You must choose how far you want to take this investigation and why you want to make that journey to find out why you feel the way you do and whether the answers lie in your parents’ past or in liberating yourself from their tortured story in order to make a happier one for yourself. It’s not an emotional trip suited to the solo traveller. I suggest you find yourself a good psychologist (contact mind.org.uk). If you’re determined to open Pandora’s box, which you have every right to do, you’ll need experts on hand to deal with what flows forth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe27affaf1aad4173482ea1c425d61256b0c0328/0_425_2761_1656/master/2761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9996eab586a8ee02ef4f01ee81592797","title":"sunday with meera syal once school bags are packed we squeeze onto the sofa","story":"The actor on cake, biryani and family viewingA lazy Sunday morning?

When I wasn’t looking a new trapdoor opened in the panelling of my personality and now I am an auction person. Every Monday I waddle to the auction house at the end of my road, and calmly finger the tchotchkes and platters and tables and prints, choosing which item I don’t need that I need that week. I know it’s a hobby because my boyfriend alternates between disapproval and patronisation, sometimes both, depending on the size of the teapot.eBay has been my main shopping mall since 2007, because I both love old clothes and enjoy the chase. But the differences between a website and a real auction are vast and grounded largely in touch and smell, and the sense that a real person has curated this weekly museum of loss and memory.A small chipped vase is thus both elevated and grounded by its position on a table beside an art deco ring and a Polaroid of Diana. I still use eBay and, though I also dabble in online catalogues (last week I absentmindedly bid £10 on a picture, learning after winning that much of the artist’s collection is displayed at the Whitney, thank you), I am very much committed to my local auction house. This was the place my parents bought the furniture I grew up with and, after Ikea failed me through three flats and I was called back to the suburbs, the place I ended up in search of a chest of drawers that would not buckle under the weight of a bra.A recent house clearance meant one auction was awash with elephants. Elephant paintings, elephant-shaped umbrellas, bottles with trunks, and an elephant rug, and so on. Someone had loved elephants, and then they’d died. His was an acceptable collection. Some months earlier, I walked in to find a number of vivid mannequins, each dressed in bright-red lingerie on the wall various pieces of erotic art appeared, hungry women hanging alongside the usual watercolours and adorable amateur attempts at hands. Boxes of specialist porn magazines piled comfortably next to the encyclopedias, and on the ceramics table sat a bronze woman grasping her nipples through what appeared to be a wet dress. Though, in bronze, tricky to say. A local man had died the way he lived, surrounded by massive tits. His inner life, shame and sexuality had been priced per piece. Bids started at £5.Every week I feel fresh pangs at the lack of interest in anything large, or ornate, or mahogany. Family pride in the shape of wardrobes or sideboards stands waxed and varnished like bikini models. But despite the craftsmanship and years of reliable service, they don’t sell – they don’t fit modern lives, they eventually go for £30 a pop. They have a new name, in the interior design world – OBF. Old Brown Furniture. It invites, doesn’t it, a wrinkling of the nose at best, at worst a sort of gag reflex. It’s not just that modern homes don’t have room for these Victorian or Edwardian forests of dovetailed wood, though that’s part of it. It was reported this week that nine out of 10 London house-shares don’t have living rooms, as landlords squeeze the juice out of every square inch. But the real issue is taste, that bulbous un-poppable boil that grows on all our necks, swollen with class anxiety and things your auntie once said at Christmas.The stage on which we can see the evolution of taste play out is the auction house. According to the New York Times, wealthy people are having trouble selling their homes because they have too many antiques. The new generation of rich people are not reassured, but instead disgusted by OBF, their tastes having been moulded not just by years of picking shot out of pigeon at their parents’ dining table, but by telly. “At a time when home design television shows… emphasise light colours and pared-down interiors, it can be harder to sell homes that are furnished with antiques,” the New York Times reports.Which is where I slide in with my greasy debit card, one eye trained on quality, the other on exceptional whimsy. It’s not just about finding something I need, or even finding something I like. It is more base, more basic a need, a feeling that sits quite low, near my bowels. I am no athlete, nor am I particularly bright, competitive or gifted at cards. So I am chasing a moment. When the hammer goes down at the auction, I truly know what it feels like to win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7661432faa35b65a0a534f27c46b5d6450842032/0_118_4730_2838/master/4730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84baebefbc3514c54fb8d85c2851d985","title":"newsnight interviewer its increasingly hard to get straight answers","story":"Presenter tells of politicians who admit they don’t believe their own replies and others who shut down debate in three wordsGetting a straight answer from politicians in 2019 has become noticeably and increasingly difficult, the Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis has said.The TV journalist was at the Cheltenham literature festival on Saturday to talk about her book Airhead: The Imperfect Art of Making News, which takes readers behind the scenes.She was asked what her one question would be if she had Boris Johnson on Newsnight this week.“I’m not entirely sure it matters what question you ask Boris Johnson,” she said, to audience laughter.“I think increasingly I really come to appreciate the people, the politicians, the interviewees, of any stripe and size who are able to answer a question. It seems such a small, gentle thing to demand in 2019 but it has actually become the biggest ask that we can make.”Maitlis said it was of course a key part of her job to elicit truthful answers from politicians but proved increasingly difficult.“What I notice now is that a lot of the things that are said to us on camera, on air, are not particularly believed and quite often not true. It is an extraordinary position to be in. It is a really weird position to be in as a journalist.”She gave as an example a politician telling her there was absolutely no doubt that Theresa May would get her Brexit deal through and then, off air, they casually admitted they would lose by about 80 votes.“You just think, wow, that was three seconds, that was three seconds later!”Maitlis said there was a real climate of politicians infantilising language, thinking that three words would shut down debate.“It is a way of saying if you question something, you’re not an optimist … you’re being a bit negative or you’re not patriotic.”That could be on any political side, she said, “whether it’s ‘Get Brexit done’” or ‘People before privilege’.”Maitlis was announced as the new lead presenter of Newsnight in March and is grateful that viewers seem decreasingly interested in what she wears on screen.That may change, though. The show got a recent relaunch and now has fuchsia sofas. It means she can now probably wear only black, navy or white. “My life has become incredibly simple since the relaunch because you don’t want to clash with a fuchsia sofa,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fefa0a2a914c96799d691e744254303d55c28e29/9_286_1886_1131/master/1886.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8c19aaec7d64c74de49e2da9434b919","title":"operation midland ex tory mp walks out of bbc interview","story":"Harvey Proctor accuses Naga Munchetty of not letting him speak about false abuse claimsThe former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, who was among high-profile figures falsely accused of being part of a VIP paedophile ring, has walked out of a BBC interview after a frosty exchange about Scotland Yard’s disastrous inquiry into the claims.Proctor clashed with the BBC presenter Naga Munchetty as the pair discussed the publication of a damning report, which laid bare a series of failings in the politan police’s multi-million pound inquiry.Proctor, who lost his job and home as a result of false accusations that he committed child murder and rape, accused the BBC Breakfast presenter of preventing him from speaking.The interview came the day after the publication of a fuller version of Sir Richard Henriques’ review of Operation Midland, Scotland Yard’s £2.5m inquiry into the extraordinary claims of Carl Beech, who alleged he was abused by a murderous establishment paedophile ring. The report, which was published in a redacted form three years ago, found 43 failings by investigators and said detectives fell for Beech’s story.Operation Midland was set up by the politan police in November 2014 to examine allegations of child sexual abuse and homicide. It was based on false claims by Carl Beech, known as Nick, that he was abused by public figures of authority from 1975 to 1984, and witnessed the abuse of others.He made widely reported false allegations about being taken to parties at exclusive private members’ clubs, in Dolphin Square in London and other locations – including swimming pools – attended by among others the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, the former home secretary Leon Brittan, the then chief of defence staff Lord Bramall, the ex-MI5 chief Sir Michael Hanley, as well as the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor.Operation MIdland was closed in March 2016 with no charges brought. Beech was jailed for 18 years in July 2019 for making the claims. He is appealing against the conviction and the sentence.\u0026nbspA 2016 report into the investigation said it was ‘riddled with errors’, identifying 43 inidual errors made by officers, that the team misled a judge to get search warrants, and finding that five officers, including four detectives and a deputy assistant commissioner, would be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for failings.The report found warrants to search the homes of wrongly accused suspects – including Proctor – were obtained “unlawfully” and “should not have taken place”. The premeditated decision by officers to publicly say they believed Beech was a “serious mistake”, it added.It also said Labour’s now deputy leader, Tom Watson, who met Beech and encouraged him to go to police, “created further pressure upon officers”. Scotland Yard’s 16-month investigation closed without a single arrest and Beech was jailed for 18 years in July for lying about his claims.Speaking via video link on BBC Breakfast on Saturday morning, Proctor said: “What happened to me was that I lost my job, my home and my repute as a result of a fantasist who was believed by the politan police.”As Proctor highlighted failings identified by the report, Munchetty pointed out that the Independent Office for Police Conduct had cleared officers involved in the investigation of wrongdoing. But Proctor hit back, claiming the IOPC watchdog was “not fit for purpose”.He went on to condemn the role of BBC journalists in reporting Beech’s allegations, which was criticised in the report. Henriques singled out two BBC journalists who met Beech, one of whom showed him pictures of two boys who were either murdered or went missing in the late 1970s and 80s. The report said they “needed to be told of the potential damage they were causing to this investigation”.Proctor told Munchetty: “Could I suggest that you get in touch with your home affairs correspondent for the BBC who messed up potentially the investigation into Mr Beech …”As the pair began to talk over each other, Proctor claimed the BBC was “very sensitive about any criticism whatsoever that may come your way”, adding: “By talking across me you’re not really doing what the BBC should do, and that is to give a right to comment.”Munchetty went on to claim that the IOPC had cleared the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, of wrongdoing, but Proctor pointed out that she had not been interviewed by the watchdog.As they continued to clash, Munchetty said: “I am allowing you to speak and I will allow you to speak, but I also need to give a right of reply rather than letting you say things that are potentially incorrect or when people don’t have a right to reply.”But Proctor suddenly removed his earpiece and walked off camera, saying: “I am sorry, I am not having this.”After his exit, Munchetty told viewers: “I think what was made very clear there is the impact that this investigation has had on his life.”Explaining his decision to walkout of the interview, Proctor said he “did not expect to have to listen at length” to a statement being read.He also questioned the accuracy of the questioning, adding that “the final straw” came when Munchetty suggested she did not want to let him say anything “potentially incorrect”. He added: “I challenge BBC Breakfast to confirm exactly what I said that was ‘potentially incorrect’ in their programme.”Separately, Proctor told the  that one of Britain’s most high-ranking police officers should be suspended for his role overseeing Operation Midland.“He should be suspended, in the light of everything, and then a full investigation held, probably by an outside police force,” he said.The inquiry was overseen by Steve Rodhouse, who has since been promoted to a £240,000-a-year job as the director for operations at the National Crime Agency.Proctor called for Rodhouse to be suspended from that role and investigated. After the report’s publication, Rodhouse – who was cleared in 2017 of wrongdoing without being interviewed – apologised for the distress caused to “innocent people”, and said he understood the criticisms of his role in the investigation. “I acted with the best of intentions throughout,” he insisted.Beech, a former nurse, alleged he was among the victims of an “establishment group” – including politicians and military figures – who kidnapped, raped and murdered boys in the 1970s and 80s. He accused the former prime minister Edward Heath, the ex-home secretary Leon Brittan, Proctor, and the D-day veteran Field Marshal Edwin Bramall of being abusers. The homes of Lord Brittan, Lord Bramall and Proctor were raided as part of the investigation.Beech was found guilty after a 10-week trial at Newcastle crown court of 12 counts of perverting the course of justice, and one count of fraud over a £22,000 criminal compensation payout. He is also a convicted paedophile after pleading guilty to possessing child sexual abuse images in a separate trial earlier this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35107b925b9bc4d716df38ef1dbe138daabeded0/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f497408b8f80c0184a9c24cf94b5bb9","title":"title deeds covenants hidden conveyancing law","story":"Tom and Lisa Aldiss* had just bought their first home when the demand arrived. A housing association they had never heard of claimed the developer had breached a restrictive covenant by building their house and demanded they pay £45,000 or face legal action.Restrictive covenants appear on the majority of title deeds for properties in the UK and can prohibit certain uses, alterations or developments. Although solicitors are supposed to flag them up, most homeowners remain unaware of them. And those who inadvertently breach a covenant – or buy from a seller who has already breached it – can find themselves liable for life-changing sums.For the Aldisses, it has turned into a legal nightmare. A covenant on the land on which their new house stood forbade any building work without permission from the council.The developer who initially bought the plot failed to seek permission and later ignored a request to pay for release from the covenant. The property was sold on to another builder, who claimed to be unaware of the breach. This builder then sold the completed house to the Aldisses, who are now being pursued by a housing association, the current beneficiary of the covenant.Their solicitor had made them aware of the covenant, but was satisfied that the seller had taken out indemnity insurance to cover any liability. However, that insurance was invalidated because the original developer had been notified of the covenant breach before the policy was purchased.The Aldisses’ starter home is also potentially liable for another astronomical charge – “chancel repair liability”. This ancient burden can require landowners to foot the bill for repairs to the local church, a sum that could reach hundreds of thousands of pounds. The couple have had to buy indemnity insurance to protect against future demands.Thousands of homeowners could, like the Aldisses, be hit by unexpected costs because of antique laws buried in their title deeds. Worse, they can be held liable for arrears accrued by previous owners.Eva Hamilton opened a letter addressed to the previous owner of her home demanding payment of a £100 “rentcharge”. Confusingly, that has nothing to do with ground rent or tenancies. It is an annual sum due to a third party who has no other interest in the property. This is usually a former landowner or developer, or a private company that bought the “rentcharge” as an investment.Although the sums may be small – in Hamilton’s case just £1.50 a year payable to a private company – if a homeowner fails to pay the “rent-charge”, they may end up forfeiting the freehold.Hamilton bought her home six years ago and had never been billed for the charge, which dates from 1887. “I was told that unless I bought it outright for £100 I would be pursued for decades’ worth of charges,” she says.In fact, under the Limitation Act 1980 she is only liable for the past six years. But if she fails to pay, her flat could be seized by the freeholder.The Rentcharges Act 1977 prohibited the creation of new charges, with some exceptions, and most historic ones will be extinguished by 2037.But the act failed to protect homeowners from an even more onerous liability: “estate rentcharge”. This is often levied on owners of freehold properties on an estate with communal amenities, and has the same purpose as a service charge to pay for the upkeep of shared facilities.Paul Hanna received a demand for nearly £700 in “estate rentcharges” from Saxon Weald, the housing association that sold him the freehold to his house in Southwater, West Sussex, in 2016. He already pays a service charge to the management company of the estate but has now discovered that under the transfer deeds of his home, he is liable for both.Frighteningly, freeholders who are pursued for “estate rentcharges” can be charged unspecified sums for unspecified works indefinitely, and face forfeiting their freehold if they don’t pay, unlike leaseholders who are protected by law from unfair service charges. Saxon Weald failed to respond to requests for a comment.The law is inching forward to protect homeowners from archaic liabilities. Until 2013, the owner of a property subject to “chancel repair liability” was liable whether or not they had notice of it when they purchased the property.In 2013, churches were required to enter a notice on the Register of Title to protect their rights, and more than 250 have done so, affecting 12,000 properties. The rule was intended to give a buyer advance warning that payment might have to be made, and means that anyone buying a property without a notice on the title after October 2013 should be safe.As new protections are brought in, new rules can exert a similar stranglehold. Rachel Stevenson and David Hill received a demand for £8,000 from the London Borough of Newham three years after moving into their newbuild home. It was for a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), which is payable on new developments to local authorities since 2010.The developer is supposed to issue an “assumption of liability” notice when applying for planning permission and pay the CIL once they’ve notified the council that works have commenced.In Stevenson and Hill’s case the builder issued the first notice but not the second. It took Newham council two years to get round to issuing him with a demand and, when he failed to respond, it waited a further three years before sending a second bill.By then Stevenson and Hill had bought the house and, since the council had not registered the unpaid CIL with the local land charges register, it was not picked up during conveyancing.Worse, the couple were hit with an additional £2,000 surcharge for the builder’s failure to serve the commencement notice, and £1,000 of late payment charges. If they don’t pay up they may be unable to sell.The council has since acknowledged that its attempt to chase the debt was “untimely” and has waived the £2,000 surcharge, but the couple is still liable for the £5,000 levy plus the escalating late-payment fees and interest. They say they are footing the bill for the council’s inertia.Following contact from the Observer, Newham council says it is reviewing the case.Alison Spark of Thomson Snell \u0026amp Passmore says a vigilant solicitor should identify any expensive burdens that could affect the value or sale of a property. “Searches during the conveyancing process should guard against the hidden costs,” she says.* Names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e82027596a506d0e2328cbf29e8c5b53ad2f38f1/251_0_6118_3672/master/6118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08adb1b2073fde578f0dd6ae6c0a3f74","title":"glastonbury tickets sell out in 34 minutes","story":"Record 2.4 million fans tried to secure ticket for festival’s 50th year next JuneTickets for the 50th year of Glastonbury have sold out in 34 minutes, as a record number of fans tried to secure a ticket for the event at Worthy Farm next June.Emily Eavis confirmed that a record number of people had registered to be eligible for the sale, which started at 9am on Sunday and was finished in little over 30 minutes.

The race to become the seat’s candidate began after former Labour MP Mike Gapes, who had been the incumbent since 1992, defected to the Independent Group for Change earlier this year.Athwal said he denied the allegations, details of which have not been made public, providing evidence seven weeks ago that he claimed proved them to be false. The councillor said the party “chose to act late” by suspending him on the eve of the vote “when I had no time to challenge that decision”.Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for the neighbouring Ilford North constituency, thanked those who raised objections to what he described as an “undemocratic stitch-up”. He wrote: “Thank you to everyone raising objections to the undemocratic stitch up in Ilford South. It has forced a climbdown. Members have been able to vote to reopen the process. A victory for members against the machine!”The Labour MP had earlier described the situation as “a new low” and called for the selection to be suspended.A Labour source dismissed the idea that the timing had anything to do with the selection process.They said: “Anyone claiming this is a stitch-up is dismissing extremely serious allegations against this inidual. This decision was taken by a panel following a report from an independent investigator from a specialist organisation. The case was anonymised so the panel did not know who the inidual was.“The timing has nothing to do with the selection process. Yesterday was the earliest opportunity for the case to be reviewed following the independent investigator’s report.”In a statement posted on Twitter, Athwal said: “Untrue allegations were made against me on 13 August. I responded in detail to the Labour party on 20 August, with supporting evidence including witness statements, proving the allegations were untrue.“No reply was received from the Labour party. Nothing was heard until late yesterday. My solicitor was emailed at 11pm, advising that I was suspended from the Labour party.“This is not a fair process. It is contrary to natural justice. All I seek is a fair hearing and due process. The Labour party has had every opportunity to deal with this matter properly and fairly in the past seven weeks and chose only to act late yesterday by suspending me when I have no time to challenge that decision. This is why people are so upset.”Earlier on Saturday, Tarry – who is a national political officer for the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association – tweeted: “I am gutted that the selection process in Ilford South has been suspended today, but it’s absolutely the right thing to do. I am proud to have run a positive, people-powered campaign with hundreds of local supporters. I look forward to winning the vote when it comes back.”In another tweet posted in response to Streeting, Tarry said: “There’s no winner in this,” adding: “If Jas hadn’t been suspended I’m confident I would have won today, and I look forward to mobilising such a huge, inspiring and positive campaign again.”A Labour party spokesman said: “NEC officers have decided to reopen the applications to allow for other candidates to put their names forward.“The meeting supported this course of action. The Labour party takes all complaints extremely seriously, which are investigated and any appropriate disciplinary action taken in line with the party’s rules and procedures. We can’t comment on inidual cases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60f0581f08d5c8b1499d01f849935388b75fbea7/0_328_4926_2956/master/4926.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5437aab03a0130f73083bb3faa90b88","title":"scottish independence supporters gather for edinburgh march","story":"Organisers say momentum is growing for breakaway from UK in face of no-deal BrexitThousands of people have attended a pro-Scottish independence march through the streets of Edinburgh as organisers insist momentum is growing in the face of a possible no-deal Brexit.Groups and organisations that support separation from the UK joined the All Under One Banner (AUOB) procession on Saturday in the final event of the year, following marches in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Perth over the summer.AUOB hoped to get at least 100,000 people to take part in the rally.The march began at Holyrood Park and was expected to end in the Meadows, causing a series of road closures in the city centre.Bands, bikers, dogs, people in fancy dress and countless Saltire flags were all part of the rally with demonstrators chanting “What do we want? Independence.”Gemma MacFadyen, 34, from Edinburgh was among those at the rally and has backed Scottish independence since she was a child.She said: “To be honest, after the last referendum I was a bit deflated and disenfranchised and I was not going to be taking part any more.“But recently after a trip to the west coast of Scotland I’ve been re-inspired – so I’m here today.”AUOB’s rally through Edinburgh in October last year was estimated by organisers to have attracted more than 100,000 people, although Police Scotland put the attendance figure to be about 20,000.Harry Baird, 19, an apprentice marine engineer from Orkney said: “There’s a lot more than I thought I would see, to be honest.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, did not join the event but said she was there “in spirit”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c17317e690a81a3c7a078820d71892499ed8e50/0_379_4216_2528/master/4216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e51b21d167ad440b48196b5860163e9","title":"poll shows conservative party 15 points ahead of labour","story":"In wake of party conferences, a third of voters also said Johnson would make the best prime minister over CorbynThe Conservatives have opened up a 15-point lead over Labour following the party conference season, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer.Among remain voters, the Liberal Democrats have dropped seven points in a week, with Labour gaining nine points among the same pool of voters who voted to stay in the European Union.Adam Drummond, head of political polling at Opinium, said: “Post-conference the Conservatives are in much the same position as they were going into it with a substantial lead over Labour, based on consolidating the leave vote, while the remain vote continues to oscillate between Labour and Lib Dems.”Drummond said there were two main reasons for the contrasting views of the two deals among voters. “The first is that Boris Johnson, who was leader of the leave campaign, supports it, which, regardless of the details, lends it a degree of legitimacy among leave voters. Johnson’s resignation from the cabinet over May’s deal helped to destroy the legitimacy of her deal.“The second is that Theresa May’s deal had been agreed with the European Union, whereas the EU has already said that the UK proposals are not acceptable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5ac300f9fadec2a33f9c1e87be04648976813/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e377d522f87b730b9a5c0906e6da93ed","title":"tell us if you have applied for welfare and benefit payments online","story":"We would like to hear about any difficulties you have experienced negotiating computer and IT systems while making a welfare or benefit claimPublic authorities are using robots, algorithms and machine learning to assess welfare and benefit claims, but the systems are often hidden inside a ‘black box’, away from public scrutiny.

Minutes later the British men’s 4x100m team repeated the trick, breaking the European record to come second behind a stacked US quartet, to bring Britain’s medal haul to five at these world championships.Afterwards Asher-Smith praised her teammates, Daryll Neita, Asha Philip and Ashleigh Nelson, for helping her achieve an historic hat-trick – especially as Philip had to replace Imani-Lara Lansiquot, who aggravated a thigh injury just before the race. “We all handled the situation fantastically,” said Asher-Smith, after the British team had come home in a season’s best 41.85sec. “It is a testament to our experience as a squad. We have done how many championships now? We have the experience to switch people around and it was almost a PB with no practice in warm-up areas. This is a team event, and it is testament to our hard work.”Neita, meanwhile, lavished compliments on Asher-Smith. “She knows how proud we are,” she said. “She’s been doing her thing since day one. She’s killing it, she’s smashing it. She’s a G. You are doing bits, darling. You are doing bits.”If anything the British men’s team of Adam Gemili, Zharnel Hughes, Richard Kilty and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake were even more impressive on the night, setting a European record of 37.36 to take silver behind a US team that ran 37.10 – the third fastest time in history – despite Hughes feeling a hamstring niggle just before the race. “It felt incredible,” said Kilty. “What more could we ask? It took the third fastest time in history to beat us. That was the best team America have ever assembled. Zharnel, what a warrior. He went through a pulled hamstring to deliver me that baton. And we’re so proud of each other.”It has been quite some transformation for Britain’s men’s squad, who for the best part of a decade were a byword for incompetence and rancour.Incredibly, having been disqualified or having messed up in five of six major global finals between the 2008 Olympics and the 2015 world championships, they have won a gold and a silver at the last two global events.So what changed? Those inside the team say that after the nadir of nadirs at the 2015 world championships – when the team turned on each other in Beijing after bungling their final changeover – they had help from British Athletics’ lead performance psychologist, Jen Savage, who has spent the last few years turning strife into harmony.“Jen Savage has been absolutely amazing,” said Kilty. “And the work she’s done has been incredible. But we had to buy into that. You know, we’re like a family. We have so much faith in each other, it’s just amazing.”“I believe we can run 36 seconds,” he added. “We get faster every single year no matter who is in the team.”However on the night they were no match for the US squad of Christian Coleman, Justin Gatlin, Michael Rodgers and Noah Lyles, who blitzed to glory. When it was put to Kilty that Coleman had faced issues with missing doping tests and Gatlin had been banned twice, he added: “I don’t want to be the one to cause controversy again but you all know my thoughts.”Elsewhere, both Laura Weightman and Eilish McColgan ran personal bests as they finished seventh and 10th in the women’s 5,000m final.Weightman, who ran 14min 44.57sec, said: “It’s mixed emotions I think. I’m delighted with my PB, but I know I’m in 14:30 shape and when the gap was made I couldn’t cover it. There’s a lot more to come and in my first global championships to come seventh I am delighted.”Meanwhile McColgan, who was 10th in 14:46.17, added: “I knew from training that I was in great shape but it is not easy going out and setting the pace for everyone. It’s a little bit frustrating. I would have liked to have pushed into that top eight.”The race was won by Kenya’s Hellen Obiri in a championship record 14:26.72, while her compatriot Margaret Kipkemboi was second just under three seconds back. The German Konstanze Klosterhalfen, who was coached at the Nike Oregon Project by Alberto Salazar until his drug ban last week, took bronze."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e5966a048917a4dfe52175d8aa8bb2d3e7a5f82/0_204_4942_2966/master/4942.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f86a4416268b2ce74aed2bf923c108a","title":"kansas basketball snoop dogg show risque","story":"The University of Kansas apologized for its risque Late Night at the Phog event in which rapper Snoop Dogg performed, stripper poles were wheeled onto the Allen Fieldhouse floor and fake money was shot over the heads of prospective recruits.Athletic director Jeff Long said Friday night “we expected a clean version of the show”.The Jayhawks instead got an R-rated performance for their annual basketball kickoff and another big headache as they deal with a high-level NCAA infractions case tied to recruiting.“We made it clear to the entertainers’ managers that we expected a clean version of the show and took additional steps to communicate to our fans, including moving the artist to the final act of the evening, to ensure that no basketball activities would be missed if anyone did not want to stay for his show,” Long said in a statement. “I take full responsibility for not thoroughly vetting all the details of the performance and offer my personal apology to those who were offended.“We strive to create a family atmosphere at Kansas and fell short of that this evening.”Kansas has been putting on Late Night for 35 years, but what began as a scrimmage to celebrate the start of basketball practices has turned into a night of skits, music and entertainment.That’s included big-name rappers in recent years, such as Tech N9ne, Lil Yaghty and 2 Chainz.None of them brought the cache of Snoop, though. The 47-year-old rapper and well-known sports fan was expected to take the minds of players, fans and recruits off the specter of the NCAA investigation and turn attention fully to a season in which the Jayhawks are expected to be title contenders.The school even promoted his appearance with a social media video of Hall of Fame coach Bill Self wearing a gaudy chain and Adidas shirt – the focus of the NCAA inquiry has been on the apparel company’s dealings with recruits, including whether officials paid them to steer them to its schools.Wearing a No 20 jersey with “Snoop” on the back, the artist performed for about 35 minutes to a full house that included the men’s and women’s basketball teams. But he wound up singing unedited versions of several hits, such as “Gin and Juice” and “Drop It Like It’s Hot”, as pole dancers performed and fake $100 bills featuring the rapper’s face were shot over players and recruits.Self said he wasn’t feeling well and spent most of the performance in the locker room. He later told The Kansas City Star he expected a “radio edited” version of the songs.“I don’t guess you have visuals on radio. I learned that tonight,” Self told the Star. “That’s not the direction anybody at our school would want that to go at all, regardless of any entertainment that it provided many, it was still not the right way to provide the entertainment.”Especially given the controversy already surrounding the tradition-rich program.The school received a notice from the NCAA late last month alleging three severe violations tied to recruiting and a responsibility charge leveled against Self. Also cited is a lack of institutional control within the program.The document does not detail what Kansas is accused of doing. The program is among the most prominent in an NCAA inquiry into a pay-for-play scheme that began with an FBI investigation into the apparel company Adidas.A former employee for the company later testified that he made payments to the family of one Kansas recruit and  of a current player, and text messages presented in court revealed a close relationship between Self and the Adidas employee.The school has said it will appeal and “strongly disagrees” with the assertion it lacks institutional control.Kansas will be allowed to present its case at a hearing. The NCAA will then rule, often within several months, and the school has the right to appeal.North Carolina State also has received a notice of allegations. Arizona, Auburn, Creighton, Louisville, LSU and Southern California are among those under the NCAA microscope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/050041b528cd58fae971b378205a2baf9d60df9a/0_151_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe2c9de0719bd5af0c8152c8d71e920b","title":"talking horses enable arc longchamp racing","story":"Around 15,000 British and Irish racegoers are expected at Longchamp on Sunday and all but a handful will be hoping – indeed, expecting – to see Enable round off a glorious career with a historic third success in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe.Who can blame them? The script to this point seems to demand nothing less. But it may also do its leading player something of a disservice, because the final scene that would confirm Enable’s place among European racing’s all-time greats is a long way from being a foregone conclusion.The 15th race of her career promises to be the most demanding assignment of all. The field is the smallest for a dozen years but there is a depth to the competition that was not there in 2017 – when Enable had all the allowances as a three-year-old filly – or 2018, when the year-younger Sea Of Class was seemingly beaten only by her draw.Sea Of Class was the obvious potential improver in last year’s field and she got to within a nose of Enable.This year, though, Enable has three opponents with a similar profile: Sottsass, Japan and the four-year-old Ghaiyyath. All three are fresh, lightly-raced and have very little to find to give her a race.Enable’s class, courage and will to win may see her through once again, but to justify quotes of 4-6, she should be several pounds clear of her field on ratings. Timeform’s figures, though, have her behind Ghaiyyath before factoring in her 3lb mares’ allowance.On the weight-adjusted ratings, Japan and Sottsass are 6lb and 7lb behind Enable, after eight and six races respectively. Both have scope for further improvement, Sottsass in particular, and Jean-Claude Rouget’s runner has also been prepared solely with the Arc in mind.At the available prices, Ghaiyyath must be the value in the market at around 12-1 and potentially bigger still on the PMU. Perhaps it is his disappointing run in the Prix Ganay in April that sticks in some punters’ minds, but that followed close behind his impressive first outing for six months. His first start at 12 furlongs, meanwhile, in last month’s Grosser Preis at Baden, saw him put his exceptional stride to good use on the way to a 14-length success.The draw could have been kinder but the widest stall of 12 is much less of a challenge than 18 of 18, and in terms of his form, rating and scope for improvement, Ghaiyyath’s chance to upset the favourite is as good, if not better, than that of Sottsass or Japan. An each-way bet at 12-1 is surely the way to go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb4de2905e7ca7b05e157a9299ef33dfdbaae11/0_106_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bafab9696123da74bd07d579a06a233a","title":"all blacks brush aside brave namibia in rugby world cup","story":"Not every inflated Rugby World Cup scoreline tells the full story and this was a prime example. New Zealand may have finished up with 11 tries and a comfortable-looking victory but the final margin did scant justice to the efforts of a spirited Namibia who, for 35 minutes, proved more than a match for their illustrious opponents.Namibia’s collection of amateurs and journeymen pros - their line-up included farmers, a bank worker and a dentist - did their nation proud, playing with more pace, intent and accuracy than many of their supposed peers. For three and half minutes early on, the lowest-ranked side in the tournament even led the two-time world champions and were still only 10-9 down heading towards half-time.The All Blacks, in addition, had just lost their prop Nepo Laulala to the sin-bin and when a sore-looking Brodie Retallick also departed the fray prematurely, Steve Hansen’s men were looking genuinely under the cosh.Fly-half Helarius Kisting had a fine game and the Namibia scrum-half Damian Stevens, possessor of one of the smoothest passes in the tournament, proved equally impressive off the kicking tee, nailing three penalties as the referee Pascal Gauzere showed New Zealand no mercy at the breakdown.Prop Andrea Lovotti and replacement Nicola Quaglio will miss Italy\u0027s final Rugby World Cup Pool B game against New Zealand, as well as any potential quarter-final and semi-final, after both receiving three-match bans for lifting tackles, a judicial committee said on Sunday.Lovotti was sent off for dropping Duane Vermeulen on his head in the 43rd minute of Friday\u0027s game against the Springboks while Quaglio was cited for his involvement in the same tackle as Italy went on to lose 49-3.If Italy does not progress, the balance of the suspensions will be served in the players\u0027 upcoming Pro14 matches, the committee said. ReutersIt was fun while it lasted but the tide had to turn eventually. Losing Laulala seemed to galvanise his teammates and a try apiece from replacement Angus Ta’avoa and full-back Ben Smith, added to earlier scores from Seru Reece and Anton Lienert-Brown, saw New Zealand go in 24-9 ahead at the interval,Despite a second All Blacks yellow card, this time for Ofa Tu’ungafasi, it was one-way traffic thereafter. Smith, Reece and Lienert-Brown all ended up with two tries each and there were further five-pointers for Joe Moody, Sam Whitelock, Jordie Barrett and a flying TJ Perenara as the All Black forwards cranked up the pressure.Namibia, though, never lay down even after the departure of their hard-tackling captain Johan Deysel, known as ‘Buffy’ to his team-mates because of his reputation for slaying unwary opponents on the field.On paper the final scoreline looks worse than the 58-14 outcome in this corresponding fixture in London’s Olympic Stadium in 2015, but Namibia made more clean breaks than South Africa managed against the same opposition on the opening weekend. On this evidence, they are an improving side who should run Canada close in their finalPool B fixture on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8cddf7540e93b1dd95ab6d7ee0596f8fc37539c/199_160_2243_1346/master/2243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=454fa1e0505507dcfe081a2ae5769df6","title":"france v tonga rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"74 min: Ball in hand for France, but Nasi Manu puts in a gynormous hit and drives them back. However, France are keeping plenty of the ball. The potential grandstand finish, after that brilliant Tongan try by Hingano, has not materialised. Which is testament to France and they way they have contained this dangerous opponent.71 min: Du Pont puts in a good touch-finder on the right. Guirado then tries to power up the middle. Tonga need to get our of their own 22 ... Camille Lopez tries to sprint on to a looping kick by Du Pont but it’s touched down in goal by Tongan hands instead. France are seeing this out, it seems, and will secure their quarter-final place in a few minutes.70 mins: We have 10 minutes left and Tonga have a scrum. They are really giving this a good shot, but the French tackling - for the moment - is impressive and continues to snuff out their opponents. Tonga then do find space on the right, but Cooper Vuna’s foot is in touch and it’s back for a French line-out around halfway. Nine points is still the difference ...69 min: The replacement Tongan hooker, Sefo Sakalia, has gone off injured. Tonga have emptied their bench. France have made six out of seven possible replacements.67 min: Game, set and match? France rip the ball from Tongan hands in the 22. Du Pont executes a simple off-load to Penaud, and he sprints over in the corner. But no! The TMO has checked it, and there was a knock-on in the build-up. No try! The score stays at 23-14. The ‘VAR’ check denies the French and Tonga have a life line.65 min: This is more brilliant stuff from Raka, who collects a looping pass from Du Pont on the left, kicks ahead towards the corner, and manages (again) to collect his own kick. But the Tongan scramble defence is excellent, right in the left-hand corner of the pitch, and they win a penalty.64 min: Piutau makes a nice break for Tonga and off-loads approaching the halfway line, which suddenly creates a bit of space, but the French defence holds firm again.62 min: Now Penaud and Medard combine in the French 22 to deal with another kick from Tonga. France have taken the sting out of the Samoan comeback effectively in the past 10 minutes. Medard now collects another high kick expertly and takes the ball into contact in midfield.61 min: Tongan lock Leva Fifita off, Daniel Faleafa on. Tonga need to find a score and pretty quickly if we are going to have an exciting conclusion to this one. But France have ball in hand, and are on the move into the Tongan half.60 min: Tonga make inroads into the French half, but Raka collects a searching kick and hammers it back into the Tongan 22, on the left wing. France will be happy to see the clock ticking down, leading as they do by nine points. Tonga need to score twice at least if they are going to get anything here. Les Bleus have a little more breathing space. There are 20 minutes left. Chat has gone off, Guirado has come on in the front row. Tongan hooker Ngauamo is also off, for Sefo Sakalia.58 min: Lousi concedes a penalty for coming in at the side. On replay, it looks like the wrong decision. Du Pont had his hands on the ball and Lousi had every right to contest it. Anyway, it’s another France penalty.56 min: As we approach the final quarter, there are only six points in it. This has been a very spirited, skilful effort by Tonga to get right back into the match. Tonga now have the put-in at a scrum in their 22.53 min: Replacements news - France freshen things up. Poirot, Slimani, Serin and Vahaamahina off for France. Baille, Setiano, Le Roux and Du Pont come on. Fresh legs see France mount a very strong attack right to the Tongan try line but Du Pont, just on, spills the ball in contact and Tonga manage to clear.A nerver-settler for France after the offside decision against Tonga.50 min: Veainu makes another brilliant break for Tonga - this time right through the middle - but the Tongan forwards are offside and it’s pulled back. Meanwhile a replay shows that Penaud was lucky not to be pinged for jumping into a tackle a few moments before that.WOW! Tonga attack down the right, and a brilliant kick by Cooper Vuna into the 22 bounces behind Medard. The French full-back can’t deal with it, it sits up nicely for the No 13 Malietoa Hingano, who grabs it, smashes through Medard’s desperate tackle and scores. Never let a rugby ball bounce, that is my motto. The try is converted after Tonga’s riotous celebrations in the in-goal area. Can they pull off a shock? France are really in a game now!45 min: France open side Charles Ollivon is over for a try, but there was a forward pass, and it won’t count. The French had a line-out on halfway and pulled off a nice training ground move with Ollivon and Chat exchanging quick passes at the front of the line-out. That would surely have put the match to bed.43 min: Tonga mount an attack down the middle, and batter their way almost under the posts again! But Vahaamahina burrows away for the ball after a tackle, wins a penalty, and France can clear.41 min: Strong, strong start from Tonga. They win the put-in at the first scrum of the second half, and then get a big shove on, forcing the French back on halfway. They celebrate the scrum penalty like they’ve won the match ... Prop Siosiua Halanukonuka has just come on, for Ma’afu Fia, and makes an immediate impact.Here we go. Can Tonga get back into it?Thanks to Jim for emailing in about Sean Fitzpatrick’s pre-match comments about France, when he said they don’t deliver consistently enough on the big stage:“Strange comments from the NZ legend, France have been in 3 WC finals, ok not so good the last few yrs and I don’t agree re: the talent, not enough there and poor conditioning fitness. Is he still thinking about 2007 ?”In fairness to Fitzpatrick, I only pulled out a short line from several thoughts he put forward about France. He obviously respects them - the All Blacks legend lost to France more than any other side during his international career.We’re seeing a few replays of those two first-half challenges by Lousi. The second one on Alldritt, in particular, looks very bad. Tonga have got away with one if not two yellow cards so can count themselves lucky.England’s players will no doubt be recovering after yesterday’s win against Argentina, and watching this match on telly. I wonder what they make of France?A very decent half of rugby. Some beautiful running lines and off-loading by France and two tries. Tonga made plenty of mistakes, but will go into that changing room buoyed by that try for Takulua, which was really all about sheer power and determination.France only need two points - a draw, in other words - to book a last-eight place. But they look very well set for victory.Really, really good score by Tonga on the stroke of half-time. They are back in this. It started with a scrum penalty, a good line-out and driving maul. France held firm for a while but in the end the powerful Tongans smashed over - and it was a fully deserved score. That sets us up nicely for the second half.37 min: They do get the line-out right. It goes short and Tonga set up a driving maul. They make a few very hard-fought yards against this massive French pack, and continue to drive it on to nearly under the posts, moving through seven phases. France manage to hold firm, right under their posts, for a few seconds, but then it looks like Takulua is over for the try! TMO check. The referee tells his TMO he thinks it’s no try. But I think it’s on the line ...36 min: With 10 points in it, a Tongan try would have brought about some French nerves. At 17-0, it’s slipping away from the Pacific Islanders. But now they win a penalty at a scrum and will have a chance to get on the board before half-time. They kick for touch around the French 22, on the left. Can they get the line-out right?Clermont’s Alivereti Raka has been very good so far, the most dangerous attacking runner on the pitch, and he deserves that try. French power at the scrum had Tonga on the back foot. Raka finds space on the left wing, he puts in a nice little grubber kick, runs around the defensive cover and grabs a try for himself. Ntamack adds the extras.30 min: Possession for Tonga from a scrum, but another handling error then brings a French scrum. Tonga have made a lot of mistakes, but this is proving a real test for France. 28 min: France centre Raka embarks on another thrilling run through the Tongan defence, around halfway, and the crowd are on their feet. He loses the ball forward after an excellent tackle by full-back Veainu, and then there’s a bit of a scuffle that the referee is having to sort out.27 min: Camille Chat, the hooker, makes another strong carry for France. He has been a real livewire so far. Now, the TMO is having a look at the late hit by Sam Lousi on French No 8 Alldritt. But it’s just a penalty. Alan Quinlan says - “I give up.” He clearly thinks Lousi should be in the bin. It was a late hit and you’d have to say it looked cynical, a hard hit to the ribs of the unsuspecting Alldritt.26 min: Photos from the early stages:24 min: Again, Tonga waste a good attacking position. France turn it over, Vakatawa makes a burst through the middle and pulls off a nice off-load in contact. But then it’s lost forward and Tonga will have the scrum.22 min: Vuna is getting a taste for this now ... another big hit from the No 14 forces a turnover for Tonga and they work the ball left, with pace, and stretch the French defence this way and that. Ntamack is then penalised for slapping down a pass when the ball is moved back towards the right wing, and Tonga kick then for the corner. It’s a 10-point game and Tonga want a try of their own to fight right back into this match.19 min: Tonga win a penalty at a scrum, kick for touch, and then win good line-out ball in the French half. A bit of defending to do for the French now, for the first time. Tonga keep it tight and try to bash away at the French defence with some big carries, but the ball is lost in contact, and Cooper Vuna pulls off an excellent tackle to stop a French counterattack.18 min: Here’s the Tongan haka:14 min: A replay shows Tonga No 4 Lousi putting his shoulder in dangerously at a ruck. There is no card, but there is a penalty. Ntamack pulls it wide. On commentary, Alan Quinlan is saying that was a clear yellow card. Maybe there will be a citing for Lousi.13 min: Veainu puts up a very good kick into the French 22, which is initially dealt with well by Ntamack. But Tonga turn it over in a dangerous area for France, but almost immediately cough up possession to their opponents again, and France power down to the other end. A missed opportunity for Tonga there.11 min: Full-back Medard gets involved now with a lovely no-look off-load to Vakatawa on the left wing, but the try-scorer spills this one, and Tonga have a chance to kick for territory, for the first time spending a few seconds in the French half ...9 min: Under defensive pressure, fly-half Faiva seemed to take out Penaud while they compete for a high ball, but there is no sanction from the ref. Tonga have the put-in at a scrum on their own 22. France have a stranglehold on this match in the early stages.Oh, that’s lovely ... There is space for the first time in midfield for France. Chat grabs an over-thrown line out from Tonga and then it goes through the French hands. A beautiful step by No 11 Raka, from the left wing back to the inside, blows a gaping hole in the Tongan defence. Then it’s a one-handed off-load back inside again for Vakatawa who runs in under the posts. Magnifique! Ntamack puts over the extras.It was super work competing at the breakdown by front-rower Camille Chat that forced the penalty, and Ntamack converts it easily. Very solid start for France.2 min: An attacking line-out for France, and they batter away at the defensive line a couple of times, before the fly-half Ntamack puts in a smart low kick to the corner. From the resulting line-out, France force a penalty, and they will kick for the posts.Tonga get things moving and the 30,000-strong crowd roar their appreciation. Tonga are wearing white shirts, red shorts, white socks. Needless to say France are in blue shirts, white shorts, red socks.The All Blacks played some lovely stuff earlier. Let’s hope for plenty more from France and Tonga.Le Marseillaise ... simply the best national anthem in the world. Now, time for the haka.The teams are walking out. A couple of anthems, a haka, some taiko drumming, and we’ll be ready to go.Now we are on the subject of French rugby - this, from Bayonne yesterday, is ludicrously good:ITV pundit Sean Fitzpatrick: “I’m hoping today, against Tonga, France are going to turn up ... they have the talent, but they just don’t deliver on the world stage enough.”ITV just ran a highlights package of Tonga’s shock win against France at the 2011 Rugby World Cup in Wellington, New Zealand. France went on to make the final at that tournament, of course. How Tonga would love to register their first win of their 2019 campaign today.Nic Berry, from Australia, is our referee today. His assistants are Matthew Carley, from England and Paul Williams from New Zealand. Ben Skeen, also from New Zealand, is the TMO.The All Blacks have just run in a whopping 11 tries against Namibia, and as emphatic as that sounds, they didn’t have things all their own way at Tokyo Stadium.Robert Kitson is our man on the scene - read his report here:France coach Jacques Brunel has made no fewer than 11 changes from the side that defeated USA 33-9 on Wednesday. Baptiste Serin is at scrum-half, Romain Ntamack at fly-half, and prop Jefferson Poirot is captain.Just the two changes for Tonga, with Cooper Vuna replacing Viliami Lolohea on the wing and Ma’afu Fia replacing Ben Tameifuna at tight-head prop.Hello and welcome. France face Tonga today with nine points already on the board in Pool C. A bonus-point win for Les Bleus at Kumamoto Stadium today would put them one point behind England, who are already through, before a mouth-watering clash with Eddie Jones’s side next weekend. Any sort of victory today puts France into the last eight and sets up a shoot-out for top spot in Pool C next week.But first things first: Tonga may well provide a stern test for France, and the old cliche of eternal French inconsistency has applied, at times, in Japan. Against Argentina they nearly threw an 18-point half-time lead away before sneaking a precious win. Tonga have nothing to lose - and the faintest mathematical chance of a quarter-final spot.Kick-off is at 8.45 BST - team news and more coming up shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a14a0b07177d5c9a8e3600bd56924aa2c96caecf/527_486_2930_1758/master/2930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73689e6011370d9636fca7372d0478a2","title":"chasing the goldfinch visiting the glamorous locations of the movie","story":"If you fancy following in the footsteps of Theo Decker, the dynamic and charming lead of The Goldfinch, we’ve picked the best things to do in the film’s three starring citiesThe main event that shatters the life of the young protagonist, Theo Decker, occurs at the politan Museum of Art while viewing a captivating yet haunting painting of a goldfinch. You won’t find the titular 17th-century painting, Carel Fabritius’ The Goldfinch, here. In real life it hangs in the Mauritshuis in The Hague – but you will find canvases by his master, Rembrandt, along with more modern works by the likes of Joan Miró, Pablo Picasso and David Hockney. You should also check out the elegant Frick Collection, which is also a must-see for art lovers in the city – not least because in late 2013, The Goldfinch was exhibited at the Frick for a few months.Theo is initially taken in by the affluent Barbour family, who live in an elegant high-rise apartment on prestigious Park Avenue. Try Upper East Side institution, French bistro Le Veau d’Or – or sample the cuisine somewhere equally refined, such as La Grenouille, or power-lunch favourite 21 Club. For sheer class, you can’t go wrong with cocktails at the Rainbow Room, whose Bar SixtyFive, at the top of the Rockefeller Center, is definitely the kind of place one would sip a Manhattan.Fancy yourself as an antique collector? While the film’s antique shop, Hobart and Blackwell, doesn’t actually exist, you’ll find the fabulous Manhattan Art and Antiques Center on 2nd and 56th. It’s a treasure trove of artefacts – from furniture (Hobie’s speciality) to porcelain, silver, fine art and more – spread over three floors. Furnish Green, on Broadway, is where to find mid-century modern pieces, art deco table lamps, and quirkier items such as classic comics.Without giving too much away, our young protagonist finds himself in the outskirts of Sin City, living with his father (Larry) and his father’s girlfriend (Xandra). There may not be much to do in the suburbs, but head to the Vegas Strip, where you can visit the Bellagio, one of Las Vegas’ most popular hotel casinos. Tourists flock to the impressive, daily fountain displays, but other draws include the magnificent collection of glass sculptures in the lobby by artist Dale Chihuly. If you want to try your luck at the tables, you can head over to the MGM Grand where you’ll also find 20 in-house bars and restaurants, including fine dining at Atelier de Joël Robuchon, and Wolfgang Puck’s Bar \u0026amp Grill. Theo and his new friend Boris clearly prefer steak – they steal one from a local supermarket. If steak is also your thing, make a beeline for somewhere classic such as the Golden Steer, one of the oldest restaurants in town, which serves up prime rib and filet mignon. Or treat yourself to melt-in-the-mouth Kobe beef at SW Steakhouse in the Wynn hotel. In search of a little culture in between the casinos? Centaur Art Galleries displays a range of works by artists as erse as Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali and Norman Rockwell.We won’t spoil how Theo Decker comes to be in a hotel in Amsterdam, but if the sight of the city’s signature canals appeals to you, there are several elegant waterside establishments worth checking into when you visit. Try the Pulitzer its bar was voted the best hotel bar in the city in 2019, with cocktails inspired by Ernest Hemingway. Or visit the Dylan, a stylish enclave in the hip, independent shopping area, the Nine Streets. The restaurant at the luxurious Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam is even named after the Pulitzer prize-winning book that the movie is based on the Goldfinch Brasserie serves elegant fare, including oysters and beef tartare.Chasers of The Goldfinch should be sure to visit some of the city’s magnificent museums and immerse themselves in the dramatic paintings adored by the film’s characters. The Rijksmuseum is possibly the greatest, where you’ll find Vermeer’s Milkmaid and Rembrandt’s The Night Watch. The Van Gogh Museum is home to Sunflowers, The Yellow House and several self-portraits. And, of course, you can visit the Mauritshuis in The Hague to see the title painting at the centre of the story.Based on the Pulitzer prize-winning novel, The Goldfinch is released nationwide on 27 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5555234efe6a4751ef29cd592adaf2385797382d/713_0_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77d0c75794a4a38bb52e8e387f401080","title":"ansel elgort nicole kidman finn wolfhard whos who in the goldfinch","story":"Who do you cast in the movie adaptation of a Pulitzer prize-winning novel?

The decision bypassed the legislature, which resumes sessions in mid-October.Lam said the move was designed to stop violence and restore calm, but the government was prepared for immediate protests and a weekend of escalating violence: government employees were sent home early, schools were closed early on Friday and all school activities were cancelled on Saturday. Many shopping malls, banks and businesses were also closed.Thousands thronged on to the streets after Lam made the announcement on Friday afternoon. After dark, crowds lit fires at two metro stations and vandalised shops and businesses regarded as being pro-China. Police threw teargas and an off-duty officer reportedly fired a live round, hitting a 14-year-old boy in the thigh, after protesters attacked him.Political analysts said the use of the emergency law signalled the start of authoritarian rule in the semi-autonomous city.Hong Kong has had civil freedoms under China’s one country, two system policy since 1997. Although many have been eroded over the years, the emergency regulations were expected quickly eradicate many fundamental rights.“This symbolises very much the beginning of authoritarianism,” said Joseph Cheng, a retired political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong. “The Pandora’s box is opened. This law gives the government widespread power to do anything it likes. There is no more check and balance.“Suppression has begun, and there are no more considerations for reconciliation,” he said.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world\u0027s most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene.\u0026nbspUnderlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city\u0027s semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongThe ordinance, created by the colonial British government to break up port strikes in 1922, was last used in 1967 to quell pro-communist riots. It grants the city’s leader sweeping powers to “make any regulations” he or she may consider to be in the public interest in situations considered “an occasion of emergency or public danger”.The regulations empower the government to impose a series of draconian measures, including censorship, control and suppression of publications and other means of communications, arrest, detention and deportation as well as the freezing of assets, the authorisation of the entry and search of premises, and the taking of possession or control of any property.“Now the government has set the precedent of legislating by decree, more could come and it is a slippery slope,” said Ho-fung Hung, a professor of political economy at the Johns Hopkins University in the US.“Investors’ confidence in Hong Kong’s rule of law and freedom of speech, the two cornerstones of Hong Kong’s status as a global financial hub, are in jeopardy.”Lam threatened to implement harsher measures if the protests continued. Police groups have called for a citywide curfew, and there have been talks about delaying district elections planned for November.Many Hongkongers fear the government could use the emergency provisions to force through unpopular proposed laws and policies, such as a subversion law that was suspended in 2003 after a mass protest, a national anthem law and the criminalisation of insults against the police.“Hong Kong has become a dictatorial government. Now the floodgate is open, they can do what they like with the infinite power they have,” said an 18-year-old school leaver who wore a black face mask in protest at Lam’s announcement. “Like at a buffet, she picked the mask ban this time, and she is free to pick two or three more later as she wishes.”Apart from mandating schools to close, the government closed public culture and leisure facilities on Saturday and ordered teachers to ask parents to ensure their children refrained from wearing face masks at school. Many students, mostly in secondary schools, have worn medical masks while staging anti-government protests outside their schools.All the metro train services remained suspended for most of Saturday, after being closed late on Friday.Jean-Philippe Béja, a research emeritus professor at the centre for international studies and research at Sciences-Po in Paris, said the government was trying to “scare people with an atmosphere of war” and “many people will see this as a provocation”.Analysts said the emergency measure risked fuelling an even more violent and widespread resistance. “It is an attempt to extinguish a fire with gasoline,” Ho said. “It will only make protesters more determined and militant.”One protester, who has been demonstrating since June, said: “I would keep coming out and I would keep wearing a mask. I’m angry and also sad, because the government has declared war on the people.”Another protester, who refused to be identified, said further draconian measures, such as a curfew, sending in the Chinese army and taking control of communications, were all within his expectations. However, he insisted the militant protesters would be ready for any such moves as part of their “scorched earth” strategy.“If we burn, we burn together. Don’t forget, us young people have nothing to lose,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4041607.1570310871!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more than 100 000 estimated attendance at scottish independence march","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tScottish independence supporters march through Edinburgh during an All Under One Banner demonstration on October 5th. Photograph: Andrew MilliganPA WireMore than 100,000 people are estimated to have attended a pro-Scottish independence march through the streets of Edinburgh. Groups and organisations who support separation from the UK joined the All Under One Banner (AUOB) procession on Saturday.Organisers estimated that more than 100,000 people took part in the event.Gary Kelly, of AUOB, said: “It’s buzzing – the rain may be on but the people are not deterred.“Our appetite for independence is still alive.”Gemma MacFadyen has backed Scottish independence since she was a child.The 34-year-old from Edinburgh said: “I’m here to support the cause for independence.“To be honest, after the last referendum I was a bit deflated and disenfranchised and I was not going to be taking part anymore.“But recently after a trip to the west coast of Scotland I’ve been re-inspired - so I’m here today.“I’ve not really been caught up in the whole Brexit debate, I’m not bothered about that.“But I am for another independence referendum, as soon as possible – it should’ve been ages ago.”Bands, bikers, dogs, people in fancy dress and countless Saltire flags were all part of the rally towards the Meadows.Chants of “What do we want? Independence” could also be heard roaring up the Royal Mile.Harry Baird (19) wanted to join what he believed would be the biggest rally in the country’s history.The apprentice marine engineer from Orkney said: “There’s a lot more than I thought I would see, to be honest.“(I want) more radical and instant Scottish independence.“Any change from what it is now would be worth it.”The march began at Holyrood Park at 1pm and began proceeding up the Royal Mile from there.AUOB’s rally through Edinburgh in October last year was estimated by organisers to have attracted more than 100,000 people, although Police Scotland put the attendance figure to around 20,000.Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon did not join the event but said she was there “in spirit”.She tweeted: “Good luck to everyone marching for independence in Edinburgh later. I’m not able to be there in person today, but I will be with you in spirit. Have a great day. And be in no doubt – independence is coming. #indyref”– PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4040479.1570206237!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"all the president s men impeachment inquiry digs deeper","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS vice-president Mike Pence and  President Donald Trump: As Washington gears up for potentially its third impeachment trial, Trump is in typically combative mood. Photograph: Brendan SmialowskiAFPThe impeachment inquiry that was announced barely 10 days ago, has proceeded with lightning speed as Democrats weigh-up whether to impeach President Donald Trump. On Thursday, the first witness to testify was questioned behind closed doors by Democrats, as former special representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker appeared before congressional committees. Several more are expected to appear in the coming weeks, including former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch who was recalled to Washington early by the Trump administration. As Washington gears up for potentially its third-ever impeachment trial, Trump is in typically combative mood. He spent most of the week excoriating the media, House Intelligence chairman Adam Schiff and the whistleblower who raised concerns about his July 25th phonecall with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. But while Trump has indicated he will not go down without a fight, the impeachment inquiry has also threatened to drag in other senior figures in the Trump administration. Mike Pence’s role has emerged as a topic of interest in recent days. The Washington Post reported that Trump involved the vice-president in his efforts to pressure Ukraine’s leaders. Pence was instructed by Trump not to attend the inauguration of Zelenksiy in May, even though he was scheduled to attend. Further, Pence met Zelenskiy in Warsaw on September 1st just ahead of his visit to Britain and Ireland, a meeting that Trump had been expected to attend but cancelled at the last minute. Corruption issuesAt issue is whether Pence pressed Zelenskiy to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden during this conversation. His aides say he raised corruption issues but it is unclear whether he made specific reference to allegations against Biden, or if the Ukrainian president interpreted any reference to corruption as a reference to Biden, given Trump’s phone call of July 25th. A problem for Pence is that, while he was not on the July 25th call, his national security aide was, and a briefing note was most likely given to him after the call, or at the very least included in his briefing documents ahead of the Poland trip. Pence made his first public comments on the controversy on Thursday. While he did not address the question of whether he asked the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens, he did say that voters had the “right to know if the vice-president of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice-president during the last administration”. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo is also under scrutiny. He confirmed this week during a trip to Rome that he listened in to the July 25th phone call with the Ukrainian president. Though he has declined to speak at length on the Ukraine controversy, he fired off an indignant letter to the heads of three congressional committees this week, accusing them of intimidating former and current state department employees, and resisting calls for officials to testify. The state department has found itself drawn into the Ukrainian controversy – the president’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said that state department officials were aware of his contacts with Ukrainian officials on behalf of Trump. Misconduct allegationsThis week the state department’s inspector general summoned congressional leaders to a classified meeting which involved the official passing on clippings and documents alleging misconduct by Joe Biden that originated with Giuliani. How much Pompeo, and the state department, knew about Trump’s efforts to find incriminating information about a political rival will be one of the questions pursued by Democrats. Another key figure in the ongoing controversy is attorney-general William Barr. Trump said during the July 25th phone call that Barr would phone Zelenskiy, though the justice department quickly issued a statement stating that Barr had no knowledge of Trump’s call. Another facet of the controversy is that the justice department, which is headed by Barr, advised the director of national intelligence not to pass the original whistleblower complaint to Congress, a decision criticised by Democrats, who argue that he was legally bound to do so. This week it also emerged that Barr travelled to Italy during the summer to seek information from Italian intelligence agencies about the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. With Democrats threatening to subpoena the White House for documents, these key figures will play a key role in the development of the impeachment inquiry. As in Nixon’s time, much will depend on how far all the president’s men will go to protect the president.

But by late afternoon, they were down as much as 38.9 per cent.Sales also fell 0.7 per cent and bosses warned that the company will continue to struggle in the second half of the year if market conditions do not improve, pointing out that the warm weather in September is already having a negative impact.The fashion brand also suffered from the troubles of Debenhams and House of Fraser in the UK and Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s in the US – department stores where Ted Baker had a significant presence.It took a hit of £600,000 from the collapse of House of Fraser alone.Created with Sketch.Best high street fashion buys in October 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chairman David Bernstein said: “Trading conditions have been characterised by unprecedented and sustained levels of promotional activity across the sector with, in several cases, distressed discounting from brands and retailers and heightened competition.“The group’s performance has been impacted by very difficult trading conditions throughout the period, amplified by heightened levels of consumer uncertainty across many of Ted Baker’s global markets.“The financial results we delivered in the first half were behind our expectations.

I would decline’\u0026nbspThe head of a private school has said he would rather close down than see it become part of the state system.Magnus Bashaarat, of the £37,000-a-year Bedales in Hampshire, made the claim in the wake of the Labour Party conference voting to integrate private schools with the public sector.He said: “Were I to be given the ultimatum, tomorrow, that Bedales be made a state school, and that it should follow the national curriculum and policymakers’ preoccupations with the transfer of knowledge and disregard for humanities and the arts, I would decline. I would rather we shut our doors.”At last month’s party conference, Labour voted to scrap private schools, redistribute their assets among state schools and end their charitable status and tax privileges.But Mr Bashaarat condemned the state system’s focus on “the stultifying effects of competitive examinations and the importance of social background to academic achievement”.Writing in The Times, he said he liked the idea of a national education system without the dichotomy between state and independent schools but that the UK had an “awfully long way to go” before it was ready to integrate the two systems “without sacrificing everything good that we do”.Created with Sketch.Syrian refugee in Lebanon: Education is the foundation of my dreams Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sara, 11, is a Syrian refugee living in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley in an informal tented settlement.

The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history.For a limited time, The Roots’ Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world’s “greatest turmoils”. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot – a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers.Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson\u0027s geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die.

As chair of the lower house, his position is not subject to the authority of the executive.However, it is possible that a ruling party with a large majority in the Commons could encourage its MPs to press for some kind of parliamentary review of the practices and conventions relating to the role.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAny such move would take place under a future holder of the post, as Mr Bercow has announced he will stand down on 31 October.Following Boris Johnson’s humiliation at the hands of the Supreme Court over his suspension of parliamentary sittings, the minister suggested that a Brexit-backing private inidual could follow the lead of campaigner Gina Miller and take legal action against those accused of delaying EU withdrawal.“I think someone should take parliament to court for failing to deliver on the result of the referendum and take the speaker to court for bending the rules of parliament to try to stop it,” said the minister.Asked about the prospect of a review of his role, the speaker’s office said: “This is news to us.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

The  dates include:In the UK, the celebration was founded by the charity Age Concern.Its been celebrated on the first Sunday in October since .In other nations its been introduced for much the same reasons - celebrating the love and achievements of the older generation.The US was one of the first to introduce the day in .A housewe in West Virginia, Marian Lucille Herndon McQuade, is credited with founding the celebration after her work with older people.Its entirely up to you how to celebrate this day - but a homemade card is likely to go down well.You can also find and send one online,thats more your bag.Even better, you could make the day special by visiting the grandparent figures in your le.Baking a cake, going on a nice walk or taking them out for tea are all suggestions - but it will really depend on what they like doing best."},{"url":null,"title":"brussels want uk captive colony exporters","story":"It makes big concessions – on money, on treating Northern Ireland dferently, on following some EU rules after leaving.But my hunch is that Brussels will still say no. Why  Because, for the EU, the aim was never to avoid a hard border in Ireland — something these proposals plainly achieve.The aim, rather, was to keep Britain in a subordinate position, still subject to EU law and trade policy.Brussels was reluctant to spell this out in so many words — at least publicly.A fly-on-the-wall documentary caught the staff of the European Parliament’s Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, cheering when Theresa May’s Cabinet accepted the backstop.“It took us two years,” said one, joyfully, “but we finally turned them into a colony”. Obviously, though, EU officials couldn’t take this line openly.So, instead of owning up that their goal was to keep Britain tied to their laws, they invented a story about avoiding border checks and making sure that violence did not come back to Irish politics.Still, there was a telling admission when the proposals first emerged earlier this week.Reporting on the Irish government’s response, RTE’s Tony Connelly tweeted: “The main argument against this approach is that all the technology in the world is of no usethe actual customs tarf makes your cross-border business unviable, especiallyyou’re in agrood.”In other words, it’s not about the border at all. It’s about maintaining privileged access to the UK market.At present, more than two thirds of all Irish beef exports come to the UK.Understandably, the last thing Dublin wants is for us to switch to cheaper and better beef from Australia, Argentina and the United States — something we would be able to do outside the EU’s trade rules.Many continental countries also want to make sure that Britain remains a captive market for their exporters.So when it became clear that the UK had come up with a way to avoid infrastructure at the Irish border, they moved the goalposts.What they now wanted was not an invisible border, they said, but common rules on both sides of it.Oddly, this applies only one way. No one regarded it as a threat to peace when, for example, the Republic of Ireland left the sterling zone and joined first the ERM and then the euro. But Britain signing its own trade deals is apparently unacceptable.To be fair to Eurocrats, the only reason they put these outrageous demands on the table was because there was a Remainer majority in both Houses of Parliament egging them on.The concept of keeping Britain in the customs union — or of an “Irish backstop” as Brussels officials cunningly called it — only appeared in late , more than a year after the referendum.Why  Because, by then, there had been a new election in the UK and there was now a pro-EU majority in the Commons.Labour and Lib Dem MPs told the EU, quite openly, that they would not let Britain leave except on terms agreed with Brussels — or “not without a deal” as they put it.The EU responded by offering deliberately unpalatable terms.It, like the opposition parties, plainly hopes that,the terms are hard enough, Britain will drop the whole idea of Brexit.As Michel Barnier, the Brexit negotiator, told EU leaders at the start of the process: “I’ll have done my job , by the end, the terms are so hard that the Brits would prefer to stay in.”What, then, will happen now  My guess is that the EU will reject Britain’s offer — even though it achieves all the things Brussels had said were important.It will do so because it believes the alternative is not No Deal — an outcome for which Britain is far better prepared than are the  — but yet another postponement.When MPs voted to make No Deal impossible, they were in fact making a deal impossible, because they were taking away from the EU any incentive to agree terms.If I am right —Brussels rejects the deal, and Parliament then demands another extension — we will be back where we started.But with one critical dference. It will now be obvious to the entire country that Boris was prepared to go as far as any British leader could to find a compromise.It will be clear that neither the EU nor its fth columnists in our own Parliament have any interest in any outcome short of reversing the referendum.Boris, in other words, will be able to go into a general election having demonstrated good faith.He will have done everything possible to leave on good terms, but will have been blocked by MPs who had previously promised to respect the result.Labour and the Lib Dems will, by contrast, have to go into that campaign explaining why, despite their earlier pledges, they now want to drag everything out again.Why they want months or years more of anger and broken friendships, of business uncertainty, and of Britain being made to look ridiculous before the world.

As we are all too aware, their triumph has been overshadowed by a decision to take legal action against The Mail on Sunday over a story that everyone but them had forgotten about and with every chance they might lose.Whoever happens to be right or wrong, I find the situation desperately sad.Meghan and her dad could end up having to face each other in court. It would be the sort of ghastly media circus Harry wants to protect her from. It should never have been allowed to get so out of hand.I believe that they need to think long and hard about what they want for their future happiness and that of their baby son. It would be a huge decision to walk away from public le and become plain Mr and Mrs Windsor, but it may be for the best.I am well aware it’s a dficult one. As new parents, they want to make the world a better place for their baby. They are in a uniquely privileged position to do an incredible amount of good.But we have Harry confessing he finds it tough to get out of bed in the morning and revealing that Meghan has been left bruised and battered by criticism in newspapers and magazines, and presumably by online trolls.So I reckon they need to do some serious soul-searching and ask themselves whether the wounding criticism outweighs the potential for making a dference.I think even Harry would agree that it would be unrealistic of them to expect the kind of North Korean fawning press enjoyed by Kim Jong-un.If they make mistakes they will be called out, and they have made some howlers.Flying on private jets while scolding the rest of us about our carbon footprint is not a good look.“Do as I say and not as I do” muddies the waters and dilutes their good intentions.I do sympathise with Meghan. It must have been upsetting to see a private letter she sent to her father appear in print.But we are told that a desperate Thomas Markle gave itto the newspaper concerned, presumably as some sort of misguided attempt to make contact with his estranged daughter.There’s no denying Thomas has been an idiot, with set-up paparazzi photos, plus interviews bemoaning he has lost touch with Meghan. Every time he opens his mouth, the gulf between them grows wider. Harry hasn’t even met his father-in-law. Even the birth of Archie didn’t heal the rt.If Harry’s mum was alive it would all have been very dferent. Canny Diana would have dazzled Thomas and welcomed him to the family. She would have protected her son and burnished the Meghan and Harry fairytale.Harry mentions his mum in the statement he made justying the decision to take legal action, and he is absolutely spot on about how she was pursued and hounded.It should be pointed out, however, that it was foreign paparazzi out to make a fast buck who pursued her on the night she died. The accident was fatal because she wasn’t wearing a seatbelt and the driver of her car was drunk.Harry must realise that his wonderful Invictus Games and important work highlighting mental health would not be as le-changing or effectivethe media wasn’t there to cover the events.I understand why he is angry. He is protective of his we and finds it unbearable to see her upset.Like most people in the public eye, I have been subjected to deeply distressing and inaccurate media coverage, although nothing remotely on the scale suffered by members of the Royal Family.It’s tempting to hit back, but I’ve always thought it comes with the territory, andyou and those you care about know the truth that’s all that matters.Harry and Meghan are rich enough in their own right to live extremely comfortablythey gave up being royals.They could freely live anywhere in the world and Archie could grow up without any media scrutiny.If they don’t care about the fame and being “celebrities” then surely it’s a no-brainer.It would be a real shame as they have such a lot to offer but no one wants them to be miserable or even resentful.They’ve a whole lot of thinking to do.Since I turned  my mantra has been “a little bit of what you fancy does you good”.In the past decade I haven’t denied myself anythingand as a result have never felt healthier.All things in moderation hasn’t let me down yet and there really is nothing like a bacon roll slathered in butter with a fried egg on top. Unless it is a juicy steak washed down with a very large glass of red.As long as you aren’t ­having deep-fried lard three times a day then I say go for it – and ignore the faddy-food police.AMID the posturing, the bickering, the juvenile name-calling and the sheer ineptitude of our Parliament, there was one shining moment of clarity and authenticity this week.It came in the shape of Labour MP Rosie Duffield, who bravely stood up in the House of Commons and spoke about her own experience during a debate on the domestic abuse bill.It was honest, deeply moving and extremely important.Rosie is an admirable, decent person who articulated not only her own experiences, but also those who have no voice and who might not have bruises but are bleeding inside.She spoke about how abusers seek power and how they control their victims.It left fellow MPs in tears and reminded all of them that there is a hell of a lot more to do than just resolving bloody Brexit.Rosie is the sort of MP we deserve, andthis bill doesn’t go through it will be a national disgrace.I only wish there were more politicians like her.I HAVE been banging on about how deliciously seductive Sky Atlantic’s Succession is since it first burst on to our screens last year, and it looks like everyone  is now catching up.Our own Brian Cox is superb as Logan Roy, the ruthless billionaire who refuses to name the heir to his multinational business.Everyone is hideous, devious, ghastly and selfish, and the whole thing is compulsively addictive, right from the jarring theme tune to the end-of-episode clfhanger.It’s a bit like a really twisted King Lear, and Cox has never been better.This week the whole episode was dedicated to my adopted city of Dundee and the clan descended there from their NY base to “honour” Logan Roy.I was beyond excited to see Dundee University, the Discovery ship and the newly opened VA featured in this glossy, snarky American drama.Only one bum note.Logan’s hideous son Roman tries to wriggle into his father’s good books by buying him a Scottish football team.He merely incurs his wrath by purchasing deadly rivals Hearts instead of Hibs. It would have been far more effectivethe little weasel had bought my beloved Dundee United instead of Hearts.In real le, Cox is a massive Dundee fan and that would have been a wonderful nod to art imitating real le.BIG congrats to Westle’s Mark Feehily and his fiancé Cailean O’Neill, who welcomed their baby girl into the world this week.Mark was always the quiet one in the band, partly because he wasn’t able to talk about being gay when Westle were packaged as heart-throbs for teenage girls.That was back in the late Nineties and how silly it all seems now. Thankfully we have come a long way since then.Mark and Cailean have described themselves as “the happiest dads in the world”.I’m delighted Mark found his soulmate and that they’ve started a family together. I wish them all the very best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have stayed in a number of his residences.At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.The Duke was last pictured with Epstein in New York in  after the hedge fund manager had been released from prison and was a registered sex offender.At least five women who say they were abused by Epstein have filed lawsuits against his £million estate after the paedo killed himself.All said Epstein used a “vast enterprise” of associates to recruit them, subject them to unwanted sex acts and keep them under his control.He was arrested on July  over claims he was involved in the sex-trafficking of dozens of girls as young as  from at least  until .Epstein had denied the charges and was being held in prison until his trial where he was facing up to  years in prisonconvicted.A previous Buckingham Palace statement said: The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epsteins alleged crimes.His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  - Receive the  biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TVShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.now! px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" And dont forget to check out the all-new Sun Mobile app - with an amazing facelt, the new app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own homepage.Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They still object to anything that leads to checks on the island of Ireland, as the UK scheme would do.No say there is the “potential for some meetings next week”. There is, though, little optimism about what will come from them.Even the biggest optimists in Downing Street think there is only a one in four chance of getting a deal, and these odds are ening by the hour.There is doubt that the process will even make it into the “tunnel”, the EU’s term for intensive serious negotiations.One No source tells me: “We’re not going to get into the tunnel without more compromise but we’re getting to the limit of what we can do.”There are TWO ESSENTIAL PROBLEMS. Firstly, Theresa May gave away so much with the original backstop.The Irish and the EU, understandably, object to the UK giving up on commitments it made in both the Joint Report of December  and the Withdrawal Agreement.But this means the perfectly reasonable proposition that the UK should be able to leave the EU with its customs territory INTACT is seen as unreasonable.It should be noted that at Cabinet on Thursday several ministers, notably Theresa Villiers and Andrea Leadsom, expressed concern at just how much the Government was conceding in this offer.Secondly the EU know thatno agreement can be reached, that doesn’t mean the UK leaves without a deal on October , but there is an extension. Why  Because the Benn Act saysthere is No Deal, the UK Government must ask the EU for an extension of its membership.This takes the pressure off Dublin. It means they know the choice now isn’t between Boris’ offer and No Deal, but between this offer and an extension.This creates an almost irresistible temptation to take the extension and seea general election changes things.After all,you think — as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar does — that the UK would vote to Remain in a second referendum, why not take your chances with that I understand thatthe UK and the EU were close to an agreement, the Government would be prepared to hold a vote in Parliament to reassure Brussels its plan could pass. But with little sign of a deal, it doesn’t see the point.If Boris is to get the EU to take his Brexit offer seriously, he will have to win an election. A majority in Parliament would show both that he could pass a deal and that the UK would leave without a dealone could not be reached.In these circumstances, he would have a real shot at getting the EU to engage seriously with him.But, as Michael Gove fretted at Cabinet this week, there is a danger that the Irish government ends up rejecting pragmatic solutions as it finds it politically easier to accept No Deal and blame the Brits.Brexit isn’t going to be over by the end of this month. There is going to have to be a general election before this deadlock can be broken.THE mystery of what the Government intends to do about the Benn Act is deepening.In a submission to a Scottish Court this week, No said it would send a letterthere is no deal by October   and that it wouldn’t try to subvert the act.Yet at Cabinet this week, Boris Johnson told Esther McVey that the Government had four or five extremely good plans for dealing with the Benn Act. When challenged by another minister, Boris  said that “some of them are cunning plans”.But what could they be Well, the submission to the court appears to rule out saying that another piece of law trumps the Benn Act.  One senior Downing Street source tells me thatthe Government has to send the letter, then the EU will have to send for its lawyers to understand it.My information is that Downing Street thinks that the fact that the European Council and Commission deal with governments – not parliaments – gives it some flexibility both before and after the letter is sent.For instance, the letter that the Benn Act requires the PM to send doesn’t set out any reason for the extension and the EU has always said it would want to know what the purpose of any delay was.It also does not say that the UK will not disrupt the EU’s own proceedings – something Theresa May committed to, to get her two extensions.But it is still hard to imagine that the EU would refuse to grant an extensionthe letter was sent.No Deal would be disastrous for Ireland and it is hard to imagine the EU going for that option rather than an extension.Stewart, who has quit the Tories to run as an independent, has a mountain to climb to defeat the Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan next May.But with the campaign of the Tory candidate Shaun Bailey a cause of despair for senior Tories, Stewart has a chance to seize second place.A good campaign and a strong second place would get Stewart noticed.It would put him in a stronger position to either set up a new type of party, something he is very keen to do, or to negotiate histo the ToriesBrexit is done by then.THE Business Secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has written to Cabinet colleagues asking for agreement to offer more than £million of public backing to Ataer Holdingsit takes over British Steel.If British Steel can be saved it would preserve several thousand jobs.But there will be worries that this proposal will open the Government up to demands that they help out other struggling firms. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there was another reason Tasha had turned to food.‘Some of it was comfort eating, because about a year after getting married, my husband Ross and I started trying for a baby and it just didn’t happen.    ‘I have lots of dreams, but the main one was starting a family.aposI’m the eldest of four and had a lovely childhood. ‘We were trying for about five years and thought it was never going to happen.aposWe had all sorts of tests, but doctors couldn’t ever find a medical reason why I couldn’t get pregnant.’ Tasha had tried losing weight in the past, but she didn’t think size was an issue when it came to having a baby.‘Friends my size had had little ones, so why shouldn’t I I didn’t see why my weight was such a problem.’ Eventually, after almost giving up hope on having the family they craved, Tasha and Ross decided to try IVF.But Tasha was in for a shock when doctors told her she needed to lose weight.‘They said I had to reduce my BMI to  before we could even begin IVF, becauseI didn’t, it was far less likely to work.’    The news hit home with Tasha.‘I’d tried diets before but nothing had worked.aposHowever, this time I was so determined and totally focused.aposI badly needed to change my eating habits.’ Tasha would often skip breakfast – but then have a packet of crisps when she got to work. ‘For lunch I’d go to the supermarket and buy a pasty or a triple sandwich with white bread and cheese and mayonnaise, which I’d have with a fizzy or sugary fruit drink. ‘I’d probably have a couple of snacks in the afternoon, perhaps another bag of crisps – I love crisps – and a bar of chocolate and more unhealthy drinks.’ Tea would involve ridiculously portioned meals – ‘My husband has always been able to eat what he wants and stay slim’ – like a bowl of nachos each, with loads of cheese and a bowl of chilli with spoonfuls of soured cream, cheese and pitta bread. ‘Then I’d probably have another bag of crisps and a bar of chocolate or sweets.’  Reaching her goal Tasha managed to lose a couple of stone on her own by calorie counting and going to the gym, before she realised she needed help. She chose The Jane Plan, which creates healthy meals that are delivered to the client. ‘I wanted something regimented and strict that I didn’t have to think about,’ says Tasha.‘Something that I didn’t have to have control over, just add vegI wanted and pop it in the microwave.’ Breakfast was usually something like a healthy muesli or porridge, lunch was soup or a tuna or salmon fillet with bulgur wheat, and dinner might be chicken in a low-calorie sauce that Tasha could add veg to, or a pasta dish. ‘I really enjoyed the food, so it didn’t seem like a diet.aposIt was tasty and good for me, and as well as helping me to lose weight, it got me back on track with healthy eating and appropriate portion sizes.’ It took just over a year, but Tasha lost almost half her body weight, reaching  stone, a healthy weight for her frame.She’d also gone from a size  to a size .  Exciting news Losing weight meant Tasha and Ross could finally start IVF.It was gruelling, but all her hard work wasn’t for nothing. After their first cycle of treatment, the day had finally arrived to find outit had worked.‘We’d been told to do the test on a specic date and this was it.aposI really needed to go for a wee, so I woke my husband and told him I was going to do it. ‘We waited together, looking at the stick for the result to come up in the little window.aposFinding out I was pregnant was overwhelming and amazing – I was over the moon.aposWe just hugged each other, it was really emotional. ‘Losing weight was good – I felt good.aposBut the best reward of all was to fall pregnant.aposI couldn’t believe it at first.’  Family first Baby Arabelle was born on  December  and was an energetic bundle of joy. ‘She’s beautul and so lively and active – she really keeps me on my toes,’ says Tasha.‘She has made motherhood everything I wanted and thought it would be.aposIt’s just absolutely wonderful.’ But neither Tasha nor Ross wanted her to be an only child. ‘I had a great childhood growing up with my siblings,’ says Tasha, ‘so I wanted that for Arabelle.aposWe decided to use one of the frozen embryos left from treatment.aposAnd it worked again.’ Now Arabelle is three years old, and Tasha is pregnant with her second child, due in November.Tasha says, ‘I’m finally going to have the family I always wanted, which,I’m honest, I was frightened I’d never have.

The lump which was originally pea sized was now something which could no longer be ignored.    She said: “Visibly you could see a dference in the size of both my breasts, my bra was tighter on that breast. “Whenever I done my self examination I had that sinking feeling in my gut and I just knew.

Gary Clarkson, , was a passenger in a Ford Transit being driven by Brodie Palmer who lost control of the vehicle which went into a ditch and smashed into trees.Mr Clarkson was trapped in the wreckage and died before paramedics could take him to hospital, reports Hull Live.Palmer, , of Goole, appeared in Hull Crown Court charged with death by careless driving. The shocking crash happened just two days before Mr Clarkson was set to leave his job for a new le with his girlfriend in Lincolnshire. In an emotional witness impact statement read to the court, his mum and partner told how le would never be the same again. June  last year was the most devastating, sad day of my le. When two police officers knocked on my door to tell me that Gary was dead, my whole world came crashing down, said Mr Clarksonaposs mum in her statement.    It was asI was in a nightmare that I can’t wake up from and I am still like that one year on. Gary should still have had plenty of years to live and enjoy his le. He only had two days left before he was going to start at a new job and move away with his girlfriend. But due to Brodie Palmeraposs idiotic driving, I will never be able to hear Garyaposs voice again, never see him again, never be able to spend a birthday or a Christmas with him again and I canapost bear it. I keep thinking, why was it my son that died  It should have been the driver. I always wonder to myself, whatGary had rung in sick that day and not gone to work  Whathe was set to have moved in with his girlfriend any earlier  Whathe hadnapost have just got in that van   If heaposd any of these things happened he would still be alive. In her statement, Mr Clarksonaposs mum went on to say that the driver had no shame or guilt following the crash. The driver has no shame or guilt in what he is done and has just gone back to work at the same company and carried on. Iaposm so angry and will never forgive or forget and want justice. Brodieaposs parents still have him, but we donapost have Gary. Itaposs the most painful thing for a parent to go through when their child dies first and itaposs something that should never happen. I never said goodbye and losing Gary has left me heartbroken. I think of Gary every day and he will always be missed. Paying tribute to Mr Clarkson in a victim impact statement, his girlfriend expressed her anger towards the defendant for taking Gary away from her and said that she had lost the love of her le. “Gary was my absolute world but my whole world turned around when I got the devastating news on June . Every single morning I wake up and think about the plans we had made, she said. I was very unhappy but my Gary changed that as he made me so happy. Your carelessness ended his le at a time when we should have been starting our new le together. You have the future to look forward to - all I have is heartbreak and memories. Gary is the love of my le but he has been taken from me by you. Prosecuting the case, Chris Smith told the court that the defendant was unable to give any explanation for not being able to control the vehicle and keep it on the carriageway on the dry and bright day that the accident happened. Mr Smith gave evidence that an eyewitness coming in the opposite direction saw the van “rocking and out of control” and pulled over out of concern for her own safety. The vehicle left part of the carriageway with the nearside wheels entering the soft grass verge that neighbours the tarmac. It left the road and entered a drainage ditch before it hit a short tree line, said Mr Smith. It was decent downwards slope and once the vehicle was left in an irrecoverable state with extensive damage to the vehicle. The defendant was able to walk away from the vehicle but Gary was left trapped inside and unconscious. He tragically stopped breathing while paramedics were on the way to save him and he was pronounced dead at the scene. It is hard to say what happened other than there was insufficient regard and lack of care being paid to driving a commercial vehicle of some weight down a perfectly straight road. The defendant was not applying himself sufficiently to the management of the vehicle. The court heard that Palmer told police he hit a dip in the road at mph and went totally off course and had no time to brake. A reconstruction saw a similar vehicle drive over without such dficulty and the van was also found to be without fault, so Mr Smith argued that the only cause of the accident could be driver error. Alex Jamieson, defending, read out a letter from Palmer, apologising and accepting full responsibility for the death of Mr Clarkson, who he considered a friend. The pair worked for Green Team, an organisation which provides gardening and socialising services for people who are disabled and elderly, with Mr Palmer volunteering there for more than two years before he was taken on as a staff member. I fully accept that Iaposm responsible for Garyaposs death. I was the driver of the vehicle and he was my passenger so I was responsible for keeping him safe, he said. He was not only my passenger, but my work colleague and I considered him a friend. My guilty plea is to acknowledge what I did and take responsibility and I understand that the anger from Garyaposs family must be unsurmountable. I think about Gary and his family every day and there is no way I can appreciate the pain, loss and suffering that they have gone through. Gary was a quiet man that kept himself to himself but when I was with him, he would always open up to me and have a joke and he was always quick to help others in the group. “My heart goes out to his family and I know my words can neverto them what I have lost, but I wish to say to them I am so sorry.” Mitigating for Palmer, Mr Jamieson produced good character references from his manager and family. In the statements, Palmer was described as a good driver with a clean record since he passed his test in  and as a man that liked to help others. Since the tragedy Palmer has been unable to go back to work, and in his defence, Mr Jamieson said that the defendant has become depressed since the crash. The shadow of the event has fallen very darkly on the defendant. Mr Clarkson was a close friend of his and he killed him, which he has to deal with and think about every day, he said. All who know him say that he has become withdrawn and leaves the house little, is resigned and has retreated from his social circle and are conscious of his wellbeing. He is depressed and cries himself to sleep and needs help to work on his emotional wellbeing. Judge David Tremberg told Palmer, who admitted causing death by careless driving, that whatever sentence he passed cannot undo the harm done and told the court that his sentence is in no way designed to put a value on human le. You lost control of the vehicle, a commercial vehicle, in circumstances where there was no objective reason to have done soyou had been exercising any meaningful degree of care, said Judge Tremberg.

Louise and Derek Mills had originally planned to go on a Caribbean cruise. Instead, he cancelled the ­holiday and used the £, he saved to buy her gastric surgery to help her lose weight. Six months later, Louise was so overjoyed with the results she spent £, on a gastric balloon procedure for him. The operations have helped the couple lose more than  stone between them. Louise, , said: “It doesn’t sound romantic but it’s rekindled our marriage in a way we never could’ve imagined. “Derek’s showered me with gts over the years and loves spoiling me. Jewellery, gorgeous clothes, you name it, he’s the most kind, generous person.  “When close friends and family heard Derek was paying for me to have gastric surgery they thought it was insulting, but nothing could’ve been further from the truth. It was the most loving, thoughtful present in the world. “We’d dreamed about going on that Caribbean cruise for years but we agreed weight loss surgery would be a gt for le, while a cruise would just last a few days.” The mum of three is now a svelte st lb after weighing st lb at her heaviest. “It’s like we’ve gone in a time machine back to when we were first married,” she added.We seriously fancy each other again, which is something you don’t often hear from a couple in their s who’ve been married a quarter of a century.  “Our sex le is great, my depression has completely lted, and our kids constantly tell us how happy we seem.” Louise, who is a full-time carer to their -year-old daughter Laura who has Down’s syndrome, started piling on pounds when her mother died of cancer in . Louise could not stick to any diet she tried. “Mum and I were best friends, and when she died I sunk into a massive depression. I found ­solace in food, secretly bingeing on massive bars of chocolate when everyone was asleep. “My depression left me unable to deal with the fact that I was killing myself.”    Louise also cooked high-calorie meals for the family in Hempstead, Kent, such as fillet steak with mashed potato, huge casseroles, mushrooms in garlic butter, and creamy puddings. Soon Derek’s shirt size grew from a size XL to XXXL and the previously active couple spent ­evenings grazing on junk food on the sofa. In  Louise tried for months to slim for her stepdaughter’s wedding – but got nowhere. “The idea of looking like a blob in those wedding photos horried me but month by month I tried and failed with yet another diet,” she said. “On their big day in July last year I was the same size , weighing st lb and I hated myself more than ever. “If I didn’t get healthy soon Laura would lose her mum and without me I didn’t know what she’d do. “It was a vicious cycle of guilt, despair and depression.”  Inspired by a friend’s sister who’d had success with weight loss surgery, Louise looked ­online – and baulked at the cost. “I knew we had our dream cruise coming up in a few months, so money was tight, but when I opened up to Derek about how down I was, he didn’t hesitate for one second. He told Louise: “If money can’t buy you happiness, what’s the point ” and within minutes was cancelling the cruise. She said: “Of course I knew the results of any surgery are never guaranteed, but I also knew I’d die soonI didn’t try this. I gave Derek the biggest hug ever.” Louise went to private Benenden Hospital near Cranbrook, Kent, where bariatric surgeon Ahmed Hamouda recommended a gastric sleeve. It means removing a part of the stomach to reduce its size. She had the surgery on August  last year and by the end of October was down to a size , the same as when she and Derek wed in .  “I simply didn’t feel hungry and within weeks knew I wasn’t going to die any more. That sense of euphoria was incredible, like I’d been let out of prison.” Within weeks Louise was exercising for the first time in over a decade – going to ­kickboxing and circuit classes and riding her bicycle. But while she was “bouncing around like Tigger”, -stone Derek was stuck in the same rut. “I was slightly oblivious to the fact that the slimmer I got, the worse Derek felt about his weight,” she said. “I was so overjoyed with my new le that I just wanted tothe incredible gesture as a Christmas present. I had some savings and was even prepared to put it on creditI had to.” That Christmas – without knowing Louise had put a voucher in a card for a consultation with Mr Hamouda – Derek refused to sit next to Louise for photographs.

For walkies, Michael and Ken can choose from a collection of collars, including Gucci or Louis Vuitton ones that cost £ each, or a £ Tfany collar and lead with a £ charm attachment. The pedigree pooch is also pup-ular on Instagram – with nearly , followers.Thanks to Ken, a top fashion hair stylist, Burly has hobnobbed with the stars. The pup has appeared in British Vogue twice with The Durrells and Bodyguard actress Keeley Hawes, and Downton Abbey star Lily Collins. Other pals include funnyman Alan Carr, ex-Coronation Street favourite Georgia May Foote, Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie and Tolkien star Nicholas Hoult.  Michael, from Borough, South London, explained: “Burly got into modelling coincidentally. He was on a shoot with Ken one day and everyone there loved him. “Keeley Hawes, who was doing the shoot, had already seen him on Instagram and then requested that he be there for the next shoot.” The couple say they shouldn’t be judged because they “earn good money and can afford it”.  Michael added: “Obviously we don’t have any kids so it can all go on Burly. “We just really like buying him things. It brings us both so much pleasure to spoil him. It used to be that Ken and I would be buying gts for each other but that’s all stopped now. These days we’re obsessed with whatever new things we can get for the puppy.” They bought him for £, through a breeder near Carlisle, who they tracked down through The Kennel Club.  Michael, a crane operator, said: “In the first three months of having him we spent £, on just collars, leads and clothes. “He loves it, I can tell he’s happy when he gets a new item.” Burly’s raw food diet sets the couple back £ per week. The cultural canine also gets treated to nights out at the cinema and theatre – even attending a special screening of The Lion King. “Burley loved the cinema, he was barking away at the beginning when they held Simba up over his kingdom,” Michael said.

Journalist Claire Muldoon clashed with another mum on This Morning when they appeared as guests on the show to discuss Scotlandaposs smacking ban. It has become the first part of the UK to outlaw the smacking of kids as pressure grows to widen the ban to England and Northern Ireland, while Wales begins drawing up a similar law.The Scottish mum criticised the change, saying: I definitely think it is Big Brother honing in on this and every loving parent would use some form of physical chastisement - not always butitaposs suitable.Claire continued: “This whole thing stems from love. If you had a friend who was doing something that was harming themselves - you would hope that a friend would say look letaposs be honest your behaviour is wrong.”    Mum-of-two and journalist Rebecca Wilcox disagreed with her, saying she doesnapost believe in smacking children. She said she felt awful about once hitting her four-year-old son when he spilt water on her laptop, calling the moment her biggest guilt as a mum. Rebecca said it left her feeling like a hypocrite: I remember it was all about my loss of control... yeah, he was misbehaving. Yes, he was doing something wrong. But Iaposm the adult. I should know better. Iaposm constantly saying aposdonapost hit your brother, donapost hit your friends, donapost hit me.apos What am I doing     When she begins saying she saw fear in her sonaposs eyes and conceded there was an effect during the debate, Claire rolls her eyes and nods. The showaposs host Ruth Langsford points out that had she hit her son in Scotland under the new laws she could be prosecuted for the act. Claire adds: Youaposd not be sitting here, today, Rebecca,that was the case. Rebecca responds that she didnapost think it would go that far- saying the law would give Child Protection workers tools to intervene and educate parents against corporal punishment. I feel so bad about it I probably should have been prosecuted. That little boy had done nothing wrong. He had tipped a glass of water over my laptop.    Langsford then agreed with Rebecca, adding that children are taught that physical violence is wrong and pointed outone adult slapped another in the supermarket it would be an assault under law.The segment sparked debate on Twitter , as viewers argued over their points of view on whether smacking was an effective parenting strategy, or just outright wrong.Some claimed they were smacked as children and it didnapost affect them in later le. Others argued that they were able to discipline their children using their voice and leading by example.    Some viewers said they learned to fear smacking as children and behaved better as a result. One smacking critic arguedher husband hit her it would be labelled domestic abuse and questioned why hitting a child would be treated any dferently. Another said parents were supposed to be role models to their children and that physical discilpline taught them it is OK to hit people to make a point. Pressure is growing on Westminster to expand Scotlandaposs contentious new law to the rest of the UK.The Scottish Parliament earlier this week outlawed all physical punishment against under-s, giving children the same protection from assault as adults.A defence of reasonable chastisement or justiable assault for physical force used as a form of discipline on children was removed. It is now the th country in the world to outlaw smacking, and Wales is now also drawing up similar legislation which passed its first reading in the Welsh assembly last month. If Wales bans smacking too, it would leave only children in England and Northern Ireland unprotected. Last year the Association of Educational Psychologists said smacking is harmful to children’s mental health.

Desperately choking on black smoke, the dad-of-three was certain that he would be burnt alive. He was trapped inside his flat after his ex-girlfriend Louise Podmore, , stuffed burning paper through the letterbox. As flames licked at his front door, Kevin realised that she had finally carried out what she had always chillingly promised. Twisted Louise had always told him that no one  could have him,she couldn’t.  Podmore was jailed for seven years at Shrewsbury Crown Court on September  after admitting to arson with intent to endanger le. Now Kevin has added his voice to the growing number of men speaking out about domestic abuse they have suffered behind closed doors and bravely relives the horror of that night. The fire started in the early hours of the morning after Podmore shoved burning paper through his letterbox on January  this year. Kevin said: I just woke up with a horrible smell. Iaposd already inhaled a lot of smoke and it felt like Iaposd had  pints of lager. So I had a look to see what was going on and you could see flames at the door. I ran to the kitchen to get water to put the fire out and I wanted to open the window. But in the end, Iaposd inhaled so much that I just passed out.  I just thought, right, Iaposve paid my funeral bill, I might as well just die. Iaposve done everything I need too, Iaposve lived my le, so I lay down to give up. But I came back round, managed to get up and open the window and people were outside shouting at me to jump. Neighbours ran up and kicked the front door down and Kevin followed their shouts through the thick smoke. And he realised that Louise was involved when she tried to get in the ambulance. The twisted ex had ed to the scene of the crime after fleeing and was arrested shortly after.  Kevin, who is deaf in one ear and blind in one eye, said: One of my neighbours told me that she had done it. But I couldnapost even think about that. I thought I might die. Every time I took a breath, it felt like I was drowning in red hot water. All I felt was heat, not oxygen. Kevin had suffered burns to his head and fingertips, as well as smoke inhalation and was treated in hospital with oxygen and intravenous fluids. When he came out of hospital, he found he was homeless due to the damage to the building, which cost around £, and months of work to repair. After staying with family for a few weeks, he rented a temporary flat and hopes toto his original home - where he had lived for  years - next month after builders have repaired the damage.  Then, he says he will try rebuild his le and move on. He said: Louise had threatened to do it loads of time but I didnapost think sheaposd do it. Sheaposd said aposIf I canapost have you, nobody is having you.apos At the end of her day, I was her rock. She was fine when she was sober but as soon as she had a drink, that was it. Sheaposd become the total opposite of what she normally was. I think she did it because she knew Iaposd had enough. Looking back over their relationship,  the -year-old says she was controlling and accused him of cheating. He said: I wasnapost allowed out and she said I was having sex with other women. Sheaposd ask me why I have a scratch on my side, and say it was from a woman. She hated me going out with my mates.    When we were fine, we were fine, but as soon as she needed a drink, thataposs when it started. He added: Sheaposd come at me with knives and push them in my cheek and things like that. It would be when she was drunk or when she couldnapost get money from me. And Kevin says he gradually realised that he was being abused. He said:  Itaposs like anybody thataposs in an abusive relationship, you just put up with it. Itaposs like when women are being hit and they get asked why they stayed, they say they donapost know. Itaposs just that you think thereaposs nothing . Iaposd rather be with somebody than with nobody. You put up with it, when you have the good times, they obviously donapost make up for the bad times, but you feel a bit better. It came up gradually, it was only the last year or two that she started to get physically violent. The couple entered into a relationship around seven years ago after chatting over Facebook . He said: For the first year or so, everything was brilliant.  But then she started turning up drunk, but after a couple of years, weaposd fallen in love. I just kept shrugging it off but it just kept getting worse and worse. Towards the end, she got physical, because she knew I wouldnapost react. The problem was, every time I got rid of her, she seemed to know when I was feeling vulnerable and lonely. Sheaposd asksheaposd come home, and youaposd think maybe sheaposd changed, it would be dferent.But Kevin broke off the relationship on New Yearaposs Day after Louise became drunk and abusive again.  He said: I felt like I was free, it felt like the shackles were off.

But like so many teenagers now, she also had her vulnerabilities. Her worried parents Stephen and Jeannette had desperately tried to get her help for her mental health issues before she left the security of her home to start out in the big wide world. But troubled Becky had to wait months in vain for an in-depth appointment before beginning her art degree in September . In that time she had even been sectioned for  hours after a suicide attempt in July. And only weeks after moving into halls at London’s Goldsmiths University, she killed herself in her room. The coroner at Becky’s inquest blasted “many missed opportunities” that could have saved her. And today Becky’s parents are begging the Government to introduce a scheme for mental health teams to track vulnerable students when they leave home.    Their call comes amid a growing crisis which sees around  students a year commit suicide – one every four days. Becky’s dad, a policeman, said: “Tens of thousands of students are starting university right now and we must do more to protect them. “Mental health services are the Cinderella of the NHS and things have to change. We don’t want to see any other family live through what we have. “Losing Becky has been indescribable. We live with guilt every day that we let her go to university, but we would have crushed her dreamswe hadn’t. “There has to be checks, balances, follow-ups and communication between students’ home NHS trust and the trust they are with at university. We need to stop failing vulnerable students who can feel isolated and lonely.” Becky’s issues first emerged in  when she began self-harming – and she was given private and NHS counselling over the years. She started seeing mental health nurse Inderjit Randhawa in her home town Maidstone, Kent, in . But she felt anti-depressants she was prescribed weren’t working.    In July that year, she made her attempted suicide and was temporarily sectioned – yet it was still not enough to bring forward an in-depth appointment to get a diagnosis and possible medication. Becky was still on the waiting list when she left home. Her nurse Randhawa told the inquest her full review appointment had been downgraded from urgent to routine, saying: “She had a supportive family and seemed excited,nervous, about going to university.”   When Becky went to Goldsmiths she got a GP appointment and saw the mental health team at the South London and Maudsley Trust in mid-October. But she was told she still had to wait more than a month for a full review. She killed herself two weeks later. The night before her death, she sent her dad a text saying she loved him, her mum Jeanette, , and sister Katy, now . When Stephen, , was unable to contact Becky the next night he drove to the university and asked staff to open her door.

They were always very professional towards each other at events and engagements, a sheer contrast to the younger royals like Meghan Markle and Prince Harry who always hold hands and sometimes even kiss while out and about. But occasionally a member of the family or another insider gives us a tiny insight into what the couple are like, and itaposs very sweet. Designer Ian Thomas once recalled a moment the Queen flushed scarlet when her husband made a sweet comment about her as he walked past her dressing room. Speaking on Channel aposs Secrets of Royal Dressmakers, royal expert Ingrid Seward shared the sweet story.    Mr Thomas was the Queenaposs dress designer for more than  years, and was adjusting the hem of his latest creation when the Duke walked past the room. Ingrid says: When he was doing the hem, Prince Philip walked through the Queen’s dressing room and said ‘hmh, nice dress’. The Queen flushed scarlett. I always remember him telling me that story. She was just so thrilled to get the compliment from her husband. Mr Thomas opened his own couture business in Lowndes Street, Belgravia, in  and made many of the Queenaposs outfits under his own label.    He also made pieces for other royal women, and in  he was awarded a Royal Warrant as dressmaker. The Queen is always perfectly dressed and her use of block colours and pretty pattern has worked for decades. But not all the royals are quite as successful when it comes to fashion. During the programme the experts discuss Sarah Ferguson, with one person describing her as the worst dresser of all time.Ingrid said: “The worst dresser of all time was definitely Fergie.  She looked great in her own clothes, in jeans and t-shirts but she was just a disaster in the fashion of the s because it was just too much for her. It was too frilly, there were too many bows. She said so herself.” However Emily Andrews claims that Fergie has got much better as she has got older, and know hows exactly what suits her.

The hardman footballer-turned-actor told in heartbreaking detail how he gently kissed his soulmate and told her “I love you, I love you.” Tanya, in her favourite navy Ralph Lauren pyjamas, was surrounded by Vinnie and five family members, including her daughter Kaley, . Aged , she had finally succumbed after a brave and dignied six-year battle with three forms of cancer. She and Vinnie both had treatment for melanoma. While Vinnie got the all-clear, Tanya could not break free of the disease’s cruel clutches. Vinnie shed tears but was also able to smile proudly as he revealed Tanya’s courage and told of their precious final days at home in Los Angeles. And ruling out ever falling in love again, he declared: “She was the light of my le. I will never be with anyone .” Vinnie, , also revealed he had felt Tanya’s soul leave the room after she passed away. Later that night he sensed her presence in the form of a white light in the sky. Speaking at Tanya’s childhood home near Watford , Vinnie told the Sunday Mirror: “In that last week of her le when the doctors said there were no more treatments, I never told her she was dying. We never spoke of that, I didn’t want her to know. “But she kept saying ‘take me home. Can I go home now ’ She desperately wanted to go home. So did she know  Probably. In the hospital I slept there every night and Kaley would come every morning. “She has never ever slept one night in hospital without me there. I have always been by her side.On the week of her death, the doctors said very nicely: ‘These are your options, we don’t knowit is going to be months or weeks’. “Through my grief I said: ‘I don’t want her to be in any pain’. “So we took her home. Straight away she was on the oxygen. Then she was on fentanyl. We got some beautul innocent moments in those last days. She would try and get out of the patio windows or she would wake up and look and me and go: ‘You... you know.’ Some of the moments would make you laugh. These were very special moments.”  Tanya – who had an emergency heart transplant after Kaley was born – was first diagnosed with cancer in . She was treated at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles before living out her final days in the couple’s Hollywood home. They had moved to Tinseltown after Vinnie went from footie hero to movie favourite following his breakthrough role in Guy Ritchie’s Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels  years ago. Vinnie told the Sunday Mirror: “She would sleep a lot, wake up, then fall asleep again. The nurses and doctors said: ‘Talk away, she is listening to you.’ “There was one moment when we were talking about her horse and she was fast asleep, then all of a sudden she put her hands up like she was riding a horse. She was stroking her pillow, asstroking the horse’s mane.”  Choked up, Vinnie’s voice cracked before he continued: “It proved to us she was listening. “Then when she started asking for morphine. We knew that was the countdown.” Over her final weeks Vinnie would sleep in a room opposite to Tanya and they would blow each other kisses. Describing the moments before she died on July , Vinnie went on: “I woke up to hear this coughing. I had read a lot of books, you don’t want to read them but you do, and I knew what that coughing meant. I flew up and went into her room. She was gasping for breath for about  minutes. We got everyone in the room, Kaley, her parents, her brother. We were all there. The nurse was giving her morphine. “We knew it was the end, we were cuddling her. I kissed her a lot and told her I loved her. I kept saying: ‘I love you, I love you.”  Speaking through his tears, Vinnie added: “It was all very peaceful, then her gasps got less and less and she went quiet. I looked at the nurse and said: ‘Has she gone ’ And that was it. “It all happened so quickly, you are not prepared for it. So we sat there for an hour with her. We were completely numb. It was as though she was still sleeping. But she was gone. “When she finally went it felt like Tinker Bell had released from her. It felt like her spirit was moving in the room. I got peace from that.” Later that night Vinnie received a sign from Tanya. “We were outside until about midnight but I was the last to go to bed,” he said. “With Tanya, she would always blow me a kiss and I would catch it and carry it with me. “I went to go in and I looked up and there was a small white light up straight above me. I thought it was strange. It was right there above the house. So I went: ‘Is that you babe ’ But the light didn’t move. “Then as I went to go in, I turned, blew her a kiss and threw it. And the light that had been there went straight over my head, then it went across my vision, then up into the sky. “That was her saying ‘we are all done, everything is good. I’m up there, I’m going to wait for you’. I never believed in any of that spiritual stuff. Never. I thought it was a load of BS. But now I believe in an afterle.” Vinnie – who won a legion of fans as a soccer hardman with Wimbledon, Cha and Leeds – was married to Tanya for  years and adopted Kaley.Their story is one of showbusiness’s most enduring romances. They renewed their vows in  and Vinnie wore his original wedding suit.And the star, who won the FA Cup in Wimbledon’s famous  win over Liverpool , is adamant no one will ever replace Tanya in his heart.He said: “I’m a shell. She is the only one... whenever I let myself down, or her down, she was always the strongest, the person who I answered to. She wouldn’t give me her blessing to meet someone  – I just know her. I can’t see it happening, I might have friends or whatever, I would be astonishedthat happens. “I think I’ve only got a little way to go until I’m with her, in the spectrum of the universe.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman being driven out home","story":"NewsWoman being driven out of her home of  years just months after mum diedKerry Barrows, , says her house in Leicester is all she has known but succession rules mean the council are now trying to turf her outShareCommentsByAmy Orton:,  OCT NewsMatt Pepper, Kerry Barrows and Sue Pepper \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Kerry Barrows has received a letter from the council telling her she needs to move out.Succession rules mean that tenancies can only be passed on once, usually from spouse to spouse, meaning that Kerry must leave the Netherhall home she says holds all of her childhood memories, reports Leicestershire Live.She said: “I’ve lived here for  years, it’s all I know. “It’s not just a house to me, it’s my home. All of my memories are here, I still feel like my mum’s here. We still call it her house, it always will be her house. “I got the letter telling me that I had to move out and just broke down in tears.”    Kerry, , claims she was told by a city council housing officer that moving a family member in to the three bed house on Ivychurch Crescent, so she wasn’t living alone in the house, would help her cause to stay.  “After we spoke to the officer I asked my nephew and his three teenage sons to move in,” she said.  “He’d been trying to move home from Yorkshire anyway and I had space so that’s what we did.” Kerry’s nephew, Matt Pepper, wanted to move home after he separated from his partner but could not move in with his mum Sue, who lives next door to Kerry, her sister, because other siblings are living there. He has also received a letter saying that he must leave the property and that the council has no obligation to house him because he has not lived in Leicester for two consecutive years. He said: “I really don’t know what we’ll do or where we’ll go, weaposll be homeless. I was told thatwe moved in that Kerry could stay there, it suited us both with me wanting to come back. “I wouldn’t have done itwe hadn’t been told it would mean she could keep the house.  “My boys have already been through the upheaval of moving schools, they’ve settled really well here and my oldest starts his exams next year. I’m not moving them again.” The letter, sent to both Kerry and Matt, says that the council plans to seek possession of the property “by court proceedingsnecessary”. It reads: If the council was to grant Miss Barrows a tenancy of this property it would not be in accordance with the council’s housing allocation policy and would be unfair to the many thousands of applicants who are currently waiting for council accommodation. Kerry said: I’ve been put in the highest priority band, I don’t even need to be on the list. I want to stay here. I work nearby, my sister lives next door, my whole le will changeI have to go.

Anthony Bayeraposs reached his heaviest weight of st lbs [kg] - while he was bursting out of his size  pants and XL shirts. The -year-old from the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, had always struggled with his weight - and was a victim of cruel jokes throughout his time at high school. He was even once tricked into going to his school formal with a girl - only to have her reject him at the last second in a cruel prank, after he arrived at her doorstep in a rented limo wearing a new suit. Five years ago, his fear that his size would stop him from finding love coupled with a warning from his doctor meant he decided to turn his le around and hit the gym.    And now Anthony looks completely unrecognisable after dropping st lbs [kg] and five clothing sizes - with the inspirational fitness fanatic feeling more confident than ever flaunting his new st lbs [kg] muscular physique. The inspirational super slimmer said he now has no problems meeting women - revealing that the same girl who pulled the cruel prank on him in high school even sent him a message years later apologising for being a bully and wanting to go on a date. Business owner Anthony said: High school was really hard for me being that size. Kids are always cruel to anyone who looks dferent, so I had it rough. I really liked this girl at my school. She was very popular, and all the guys thought she was the hottest girl in our grade. I thought she was really pretty, and I must have been crazy, but I decided Iaposd ask her to the school dance.    It was my final year of school, and I just thought aposwhy not apos. I was anticipating for her to reject me straight away and just laugh in my face. But amazingly, she said yes, I couldnapost believe it. I was so excited for the dance that I bought a new suit, got a haircut and hired a limo. I wanted to impress her. I nervously drove to her house, walked up and rang the bell. She opened it and just said apossorry, youaposre too fat to fit through the doorapos and slammed the door in my face. I was heartbroken. I went back to the limo and cried my eyes out. But then I gathered myself, and thought well, you have a suit on so you might as well go to the dance. But I had a terrible time, and everyone laughed and bullied me when they found out what happened. It was horrible. I sank into a major depression after that, which lasted years after high school ended. I never thought anyone could love me and that Iaposd be alone forever. Anthony said his rocky start in le that saw him get put into foster care at age  was the underlying cause of his overeating and weight gain. Addicted to fast food, he would consume two footlong meatball subs with a large bottle of coke for breakfast, while lunch would consist of a burger meal from KFC and a packet of Magnum ice creams. Then for dinner, Anthony would gorge on two large pizzas and another two-litre bottle of coke - meaning he was consuming around , calories per day. His poor diet took a toll on his health, and in  Anthonyaposs doctor warned he was on the verge of developing type two diabetes. With his health on the line - along with the fear that he might never find love due to being obese - Anthony decided to make a change that would transform his le.  He said: I didnapost know how to eat properly and didnapost care. I was addicted to fast food. I never thought about my health until my doctor said I was about to get diabetes. I broke down in tears and realised I needed to change my le. I stopped eating fast food and began cooking for myself. I also stepped foot into a gym for the first time back in  and havenapost looked back. Anthony has since opened his own personal training business called aposTransform Your Futureapos in order to help those who are in the same position that he was five years ago. And since losing weight, Anthony revealed that he has been contacted by people who rejected him in high school for being fat - including the girl who pulled the cruel prank before the school dance. He said: When I was fat, I hated myself and never thought anyone could love me. All I wanted was to have a partner and family, so that really motivated me to lose weight.

We need to deal with what we have in the building.”The list of absentees will alleviate slightly for today’s clash with Hibs as centre-back Andy Considine is definitely back.Considine has recovered from the gastroenteritis that ruled him out of the loss at Rangers.Scotland international centre-back Scott McKenna is also in contention totoday after five weeks out with a hamstring tear.McKenna ed to training earlier this week.McInnes said: “We have players here who will be coming back and will improve the situation.

With keeper Chris Maxwell stranded at his neer post all it needed was a tap in for a goal.However no Aberdeen player was in a situation to capitalize in front of goal.In the th minute Lewis Ferguson fired in a powerful  yard drive but it was straight at keeper Maxwell who comfortably saved,Moments later Hedges shot over from the edge of the penalty area as Aberdeen began to press.Hibs went ahead in the th minute when a corner kick fell to defender Ryan PORTEOUS who took a touch then fired beyond keeper Lewis from  yards out.Aberdeen were deservedly leading. A bad day for the Dons got even worse when Main received a straight red card for a challenge on Stevie Mallan where he jumped into the challenge and appeared to catch his foot with his studs.Red was harsh on Main.Yet again captain Lewis came to the rescue when Doidge was one on one but the keeper raced off his line and brilliantly blocked his  yard shot.McGinn#s cross from the left finds Hedges who lays the ball back to Gallagher. He finds himself some space in the box but he shoots over the bar.In the th minute Hedges slid the eball to substitute Jon Gallagher who turned quickly in the box to open up space but blasted over from  yards.Hibs should have doubled their advantage in the th minute when Doidge, who had looked offsside when collecting the ball, was played one on one with Lewis.Instead of squaring to the onrushing Scott Allan for what would surely have been a goal he opted to shoot and Lewis raced off his line to make another vital save.Moments later Hedges fired in a vicious  yard drive that cracked off the near post.A man down Aberdeen equalized in the th minute when COSGROVE raced onto a corner from Niall McGinn to bullet in a header from  yards.Deep into injury time Aberdeen were reduced to  men when Ferguson was red carded for a challenge on Mallan.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Logan, Leigh, Considine, McKenna, Ferguson, Campbell, E.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred. Some  Pink-feet were present but before we left another  arrived. The pond was scanned thoroughly but no waders present, only four Pied Wagtails. A few Wigeon and Teal were added bringing the total for the three sites to .After the members had finished up for the day, the warden at St Abbrsquos reported on a short sea watch which he had undertaken later in the day. During our visit there was nothing unusual moving over the sea but the warden accounted for an adult Pomarine Skua, a Manx Shearwater and four Red-breasted Merganser. Then at .am the next day another birder had a Sabinersquos Gull with Kittiwakes and an Artic Skua. Then on September  a Mediterranean Gull appeared over the wardenrsquos cottage and there was a fly-past by a Grey Plover.These sightings had obviously aroused interest and a two-hour sea watch first thing on September  saw three Arctic Skua flying north,  Red-throated Divers, nine north, five south and  Common Scoter flying north.Less common migrants began to appear towards the end of the week with Lesser White Throat, Yellow-browed Warbler, Wood Warbler, Pied Flycatcher, Barred Warbler, Yellow Wagtail, Redstart and Black Redstart.In the following week Barnacle Geese passed over. This illustrates that birdwatching at this time of year can be exciting. An odd sighting was that of an Albatross species flying north but it looks as though no one  picked it up."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-set-turn-back-time-weekend-festivals","story":"SELKIRK is set to turn back time this weekend.The ever-popular Scotts Selkirk will take place for the th time throughout Saturday.And organisers have even added extra attractions by coinciding the Georgian celebrations with the toe-tapping Selkirk Sessions and the monthly Farmers Market.Viv Ross from Scotts Selkirk told us: \"Having started as a millennium project, this is the th time we have run the event.\"We would like to thank all our volunteers, performers and supporters who have helped us over the years to reach this milestone.\"The main streets in Selkirk will again be transformed into the days when Sir Walter dispensed justice from his courtroom.Period costumes are still available for hire from the events Market Place shop.As well as traditional entertainment, which includes puppeteers, dancers, musicians and performing animals, there will be an array of traditional childrens games on offer, such as splat-the-rat and a coconut shy.Fare from the th century will be served up at Meg Dods Kitchen, and Sir Walter willto the bench to deliberate over a couple of cases.Scotts Selkirk runs throughout Saturday, while the cream of local talent will take to stages in pubs and clubs around the town for the Selkirk Sessions from Friday evening through to Sunday.A car boot sale has also been organised for the Market Place on Sunday.Viv added: \"Our performers include GaelForce, Carlenjig, Riddell Fiddles, Bogie Close Stompers, Highline Fiddlers, and Bob Liddle.\"We are again really looking forward to the open mic sessions where we will no doubt be treated to some exceptional music.\"There will also be a host of talented buskers in both the Market Place and the High Street to add to the entertainment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"latest-new-childrens-park-opens-kelso","story":"THE latest new park in the Borders swung open at the weekend.And hundreds of children turned up to try out the latest equipment to be installed at Kelsos Shedden Park.Susan Glendinning, winner of the Ex-Kelso Laddies Letime Achievement Award, officially opened the facilities.The pound, play park is the sixth to be opened in the Borders in the last  months as part of a pound million investment in young peoples facilities.The new equipment installed at Kelso includes a swirl roundabout with seat and back support, built in trampoline, cradle seat swings and ious play  including a sign language .A central treetops towers unit also has an accessible ramp and wide slide to make it more accessible and inclusive to all abilities.Kelso Provost Dean Weatherston said: ldquoIt was great to be a part of a wonderful day and I enjoyed taking my daughter and nieces into the new park.ldquoIt is a great asset for the town and I am especially pleased there is equipment for children with disabilities.ldquoThank you to everyone who contributed to the project and those involved with the opening.Kelso, Galashiels, Stow, Oxton, Harestanes and Coldstream have so far received new play parks.And Peebles, Earlston, Duns, Eyemouth and Jedburgh are in line to also benefit over the next three years.Executive spokesman for neighbourhoods, councillor Sandy Aitchison told us: \"We have had some great feedback already on the new Shedden Park Play Park and we hope families in the local area will get along to try it out in the coming weeks.ldquoWe have plans for further play parks right across the Scottish Borders as well as new pump skate parks and fitness and youth shelters as part of the investment strategy, which is aiming to improve the right facilities in the right places."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-rachael-hamilton-msp","story":"Rachael Hamilton is Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and BerwickshireSuccess for MND Blue Badge CampaignLast week in the Scottish Parliament, it was very rewarding to see the Scottish Government finally decide to revise the Blue Badge eligibility criteria for people with MND.Several months ago, I joined forces with Doddie Weir OBE to start a campaign, which called on the Scottish Government to change the criteria for Blue Badges to ensure that people living with MND can gain automatic access.The campaign came about because of a constituent writing to me about their frustrations with the current system, and how the y process of applying for a Blue Badge is incompatible.Currently there is no cure or effective treatment for MND, and the average le expectancy after diagnosis is sadly  months.

After some detailed discussion it was agreed that these affected areas would continue to be mown regularly to maintain the appearance of the park, said Mr Turnbull.But the community council agreed that bioersity could be increased in an area of Haylodge that would not detract from the amenity of open spaces.Mr Turnbull explained: ldquoA suggestion was made that a flat piece of parkland at the extreme western end of the park could be converted into a community orchard where fruit trees that thrive in our climate could be planted, this could include ieties of apple, pears and plums and such like.ldquoIt is reassuring to see that managers in SBC recognise the validity of the communityrsquos concerns and have agreed not to make any changes, as proposed, in the way these areas are currently managed. The suggestion for a community orchard at the western end of the park is, in my view, a good one. Such an orchard would be on a piece of land that doesnt seem to be used very much and it would add a great deal of interest to the park as well as providing fruit for the community."},{"url":null,"title":"gala-stylists-pick-pace-lavender-touch","story":"GALASHIELS hairdressers Sharon Sanderson and William Pearson proved to be a cut above last month as they completed the gruelling Edinburgh Half Marathon.The R and R Hair and Beauty salon stylists spent several months pounding the streets of Gala in training.Their efforts proved worthwhile as both -year-old William and -year-old Sharon reached the finishing line well within their two hour targets.And, so far, they have also raised more than pound for local cancer charity, The Lavender Touch.William told us: \"Both Sharon and I have had people in our lives who have been affected by cancer.\"Ive done Gala Opera for a number of years and got to know our photographer Shiela Scott and the great work that she and Lavender Touch do to help people in the Borders with cancer.\"It was Sharons idea to do the Edinburgh Half Marathon to help the charity and we trained together to get ready for it.\"Weve been overwhelmed by the amount of support weve received, both in the shop and also online.\"Sharon completed the coastal route from Meadowmill to Musselburgh in a time of . while William was a couple of minutes further back with ..Sharon added: \"Lavender Touch provide such a crucial support to iniduals and families going through an extremely dficult time in their le.\"Every single penny makes a huge dference to the lives affected by this horrible disease.\"To support William and Sharon visit their crowdfunding page at www.justgiving crowdfunding stuart-mcdonald-"},{"url":null,"title":"47-year-old-cleared-breaching-alcohol-limit-charge","story":"A JEDBURGH man accused of being in charge of a car while more than five times the legal alcohol limit has been found not guilty at the towns sherf court.Christopher Smethurst, , of Brucefield House, Rennieston, had denied the offence which was said to have happened in High Street, Jedburgh, on June .It was alleged he had a breath alcohol reading of  microgrammes - the legal limit being .But he was found not guilty by Sherf Colin Dunipace following a trial."},{"url":null,"title":"monzani-trio-set-make-music-hawick","story":"CLASSICAL music takes centre stage in Hawick next week with the arrival of three of the countrys leading performers.Flautist Lee Holland, violinist Rachel Spencer and cellist Feargus Egan have all played for the Scottish National Orchestra, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.Inidually they have enjoyed illustrious careers and won many prestigious prizes as well as earning scholarships.Together, as the Monzani Trio they bring a fresh insight and personality to their performances.On Saturday, October  they will perform a stunning iety of pieces from some familiar and not-so-familiar composers.Vanda Mercer from Hawick Music Club told us: \"The Monzani Trioall all enjoy a passion for chamber music.\"Their concert programme for the evening takes us on a journey through history and begins with Arangelo Correlli and follows with Josef Haydn.\"La Musica Natturna della Strade di Madrid is next with all the charm lightness and invention of Luigi Boccherini.\"Then George Philipp Telemann, J S Bach Charles Stamitz, James Oswald, Eugene Ysaye, Eddie McGuire, Tilmann Denhard and Bela Bartok.\"This is a wonderful programme that wonrsquot disappoint.\"Tickets, priced at pound for adults and free for all under s, are available from the Heart of Hawick box office.The concert on Saturday, October  is scheduled to start at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"sarah-triumphs-visually-impaired-great-scottish-run","story":"FOR most short-sighted people having your glasses or contact lenses in when taking part in a major running event would be first on the kit list.But as Peebles woman Sarah Keen approached the k start line of the Great Scottish Run on Sunday, she removed hers and set off with a blurry colourful cavalcade of runners.Sarah braved the roads of Glasgow despite not being able to see properly, to raise money and awareness for her two friends who have visual impairments.With her dad Mike McGrath by her side to guide her on the route, Sarah smashed her target and time and raised pound, for DEBRA and the Macular Society.Sarah told us: ldquoThe run went well and there was such a great atmosphere around us with bands and people cheering, not that I was able to see any of it.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or

Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

We are told there is a two week wait when all the anecdotal evidence is that it is at least threenot four weeks.A spokesperson from Riverside said: ldquoIn East Lothian, as in many parts of Scotland, people are living longer with increasingly complex health and care needs.ldquoIn response to this growing challenge, Riverside Medical Practice has been working hard over the last few years to transform the way our patients are being cared for, working closely with a wider range of healthcare professionals to ensure the right care is provided by the right person at the time help is needed.ldquoThrough this, the practice has made signicant improvements in providing lsquosame dayrsquo appointments for those whose health concern may be urgent. In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"diary-large-glasgows-west-end-blossoming-burgeoning-blooming","story":"The Diary at Large: #Glasgow’s West End is blossoming.

The Pacic Ocean lapped lazily nearby. It was the only lazy thing in LA. Everything  was go, go, go.Including Douglas, bracing himself for the night ahead. Would Whitney Houston slink into the club  Possibly. Shersquod been before. Those fresh-faced celebrity brats would certainly be coming. The Beverley Hills  kids couldnrsquot stay away. Or the gang from Friends.As Douglas stood there, Hollywood happy, Calornia content, his thoughts kept sneaking away from him. They clambered over the Hollywood sign, swam the pacic ocean, thumbed a lt to Glasgow. And came to rest in the West End of that faraway city.Douglas Timmins, now , has led an extraordinary le. He has seen it all, been it all. Survived more scrapes than a schoolboyrsquos knee. Travelled extensively, too. But Glasgowrsquos West End always draws him back.ldquoFor a Glasgow boy like me, living and working in Hollywood was a dream come true, Douglas tells me.ldquoEven so, every now and again that feeling would come over me. Irsquod realise I was thousands of miles from home. All of a sudden it seemed a really, really long way. I missed my friends. I missed the West End of Glasgow.The West End is where I bump into Douglas, a legendary figure in these parts. Hersquos been a fixture here, on and off, since the late s, when he worked as a barman at a local drinking den. There have been many jobs, and many Douglases, since those days. Hersquos a fascinating group of people. And a good person to chat toyou truly want to understand the bohemian enclave that is Glasgowrsquos West End.This part of town has always been a little bit dferent. The people are a puzzle to the uninitiated. They march to their own drum. Booze and womanisingThe West Endrsquos unique culture was recently celebrated when Time Out magazine voted it the coolest place to live in Scotland.Which brings me back to Douglas, who is certainly cool in that quirky, quixotic way that can only be experienced in this part of town.His personality is too huge, and barnacled in eccentricities, to fit in comfortably anywhere . With his voice like tractor tyres crunching through pebbles, and a face more weathered than a Mount Rushmore President, he seems to have sauntered straight out of a Damon Runyon short story. Douglas Timmons is a Guys and Dolls sorta guy.And, like so many West Enders, he has tales to tell. Raised in Mount Vernon, he hitched up his wagon and followed the trail west after hearing from a friend that glamorous Swedish blondes were in much abundance in this part of town.No Swedish blondes did Douglas find, though he stuck around anyway, and became a settler. Douglas has enjoyed a iety of jobs. He trained as a tailor, though left after a member of the Calton Tong, who frequented the shop where Douglas worked, threatened him with a kne and demanded the contents of the till.ldquoHe happened to be standing next to a hatch that led down to this cavernous cellar, says Douglas. ldquoSo I just pushed him down. He broke his legs and all his mates came back to get me. I decided it was an excellent time to leave that particular job.A wide range of occupations followed. Douglas worked briefly as a journalist. He inserted free gts in comics. He worked in the metal industry, where he met David Murray, a close friend. He set up a modelling agency, and hired a young unknown called Carol Smillie.He also opened a West End bar and revelled in booze and womanising. Thus his dosh was squandered, and he nearly lost his le, too, when an unforgiving ex hired hitmen to bump him off.ldquoYou always think plotters are intelligent, Douglas muses. ldquoBut not necessarily. What should be straight forward and simple becomes complicated, and they talk everything to death. They go and tell somebody, who tells you. And you stop it.And how did Douglas prevent this attempt on his le ldquoLetrsquos just say there was a pavement debate with the chap who arranged my assassination, says Douglas, enigmatically.It was another failed romance that led Douglas to flee to America in the early s, where he found employment as a gym instructor. world, and had only recently stopped boozing and smoking fags.Next he worked in nightclubs, as a bouncer and manager. He even got mixed up in the LA riots, and, at one point, worked as a bodyguard for a Russian billionaire who lived near Bob Dylanrsquos Malibu pad.ldquoHe was a legend for not paying his bills, says Douglas. ldquoAnd people would come after him. So he handed me a pump-action shotgun and a Smith  Wesson . I told him I didnrsquot have a license to use guns. I didnrsquot even have a licence to be in America.Eventually Douglas ed to Glasgow and his beloved West End, where he still enjoys meeting new people, and immersing himself in the local culture. ldquoThe West End is blossoming, itrsquos burgeoning, itrsquos blooming, he says. ldquoAnd thatrsquos what I love.

When the great actor finally relinquished the role after filming every single story that Agatha Christie wrote, the television company gave him the mementos of his time as Poirot and he says he likes to keep them close by. He also has Poirotrsquos cane. ldquoEvery time I hold that cane, he says, ldquoI can feel him.The cane is particularly special, says Suchet, because of the powers it had when he was playing Poirot it worked like a kind of talisman, a way for him to transform himself from British actor to Belgian detective. Just before he started filming, he would get the cane out and walk around the garden like Poirot, quick, little steps. He would also speak out loud like him and try to look at the world through his eyes, a man who liked order, symmetry and detail. If the pictures on the walls of his house werenrsquot straight, he would straighten them. If the eggs he had for breakfast werenrsquot precisely the same size, he would disapprove. And once in character, he would keep it up and maintain the accent and performance even when he was speaking to his we.To people who arenrsquot actorsthis might sound a bit weird, but Suchet was utterly committed and methodical when it came to playing Poirot. When he first got the part, he went through the novels and listed every single detail of Poirotrsquos habits and gestures. He also made a list of ways in which he was similar to, and dferent from, the detective and the similarities were striking. Occasionally in real le ndash sans moustache, sans Belgian accent, sans everything ndash Suchetrsquos words and phrases can even sound like Poirotrsquos.Take, for example, the moment we get talking about nostalgia and regrets. ldquoWe do not know the webs we spin, he says, ldquoand itrsquos only when you look back that you say, look at how that led to thatrsquo.Itrsquos the kind of thing Poirot might say while summing up the facts at the end of one of his cases, but itrsquos also how Suchet likes to look at his le. We humans donrsquot know what wersquore spinning as we go through le, he says, but then we turn around and see the shape of what wersquove been building.And so, over coffee on the bank of the Thames, we follow some of the threads of silk back through Suchetrsquos le and find the man who taught him how to feel emotions and the father he was never close to. We also find his faith in God and his fear of death and his feeling, always, of being an outsider and of being on the edge. Poirot also fades in and out as we talk, pointing out, with his usual knack for being right, how alike he is to man who played him.But first, Suchet, , wants to do something. He picks up the camera he carries with him almost everywhere. Wersquore sitting right by Tower Bridge but Suchet isnrsquot interested in such London clicheacutes. Hersquos more interested in the salt cellar and glass on the table in front of us. He points the camera. His forehead tightens, his forefinger slides on the focus. There. Done. ldquoI just wanted to capture the light from outside on the glass, he says. ldquoWhat nature had done to it. Oh, look. The momentrsquos gone. Itrsquos stopped. Itrsquos gone.I ask where he gets this passion for photography, which forms the basis of his new book Behind the Lens, and he tells me about one of the most important threads of silk in his le: his grandfather, Jimmy Jarche. Jarche was a newspaper photographer and Suchet particularly remembers the smell of the Syrian pipe tobacco he used to smoke. He also remembers the way Jimmy behaved with him as a boy: he held him a lot, Suchetrsquos arms wound round his grandfatherrsquos neck. Suchet could also talk to Jimmy in a way that he never could to his father.ldquoMy father was a man of his time, says Suchet, who has two adult children with his we Shelia. ldquoHe was of his type. He was South African and arrived in this country as an outsider and became an insider because he became this brilliant surgeon. But he developed an Edwardian attitude and part of his personality was that he couldnrsquot open up. He was closed emotionally, quite unlike me. Suchet says he finds it easy to love he enjoys loving.The relationship with his father was always a problem though ndash in fact, Suchet says they never really had what you could call a father son relationship it also meant Suchetrsquos father struggled to express his pride in his son when he started to have success as an actor. ldquoHe would show off photographs of his children in his office and say how proud he was, but never to us. But I was lucky to have Jimmy who allowed me to have an emotional relationship with an older man who guided me in my le.He tells me a story to show what he means. If his grandfather saw a beggar on the street, he says, he would sit down next to him and have a chat and askthere was anything he could do and Suchet says he still feels the influence of that attitude today. As we talk, people approach the table and ask for selfies and autographs and Suchet is friendly and smiling, always.ldquoJimmy is why I donrsquot hold myself above anybody, he says. ldquoIf Irsquom well known and famous, thatrsquos happened to me but I donrsquot see myself as anybody dferent from anybody . Wersquore all travellers wersquore on the same escalator and wersquore all going to drop off at the top. If wersquore lucky, of course. Some people drop off half way through.Which leads to the other great influence Jimmy has had on Suchet. He tells me that, after his grandfather died, he carried on speaking to Jimmy in his head. And then something weird happened. Suchet was lying in the bath in America one day, in the s, thinking about Jimmy when a thought struck him: Why am I thinking like this, when I donrsquot even believe in an afterle  Jimmyrsquos not there. Which got him thinking about the afterle a bit more. He bought a Bible and read Paulrsquos letter to the Christians in Rome and began the process that led to him finding his faith.It took a long time ndash around  years in fact, which reflects one of the similarities between Suchet and Poirot: their methodical approach to work and le. After that moment in America, Suchet researched religion and read and read and read until he could get to what he calls a point of hope and mystery.ldquoI canrsquot have blind faith, he says. ldquoBut Irsquom comfortable to live within a mystery. We are only comfortable with a calculator. We need clear answers. I canrsquot give you a clear answer I canrsquot even persuade you. I wouldnrsquot want to persuade you. Interestingly, Suchet says his grandfather was an atheist. ldquoBut in a sense he was the epitome of faith. Loving and caring about other people and giving and being generous with himself.Suchet recognises that this belief and his faith make him a little dferent in a country thatrsquos more likely to believe in Richard Dawkins The God Delusion than The Bible, but he has become used to the status of outsider, in his own country and even in his own profession. He is not a great fan of theatricality, he says, nor is he a great socialite and doesnrsquot much like theatrical parties. ldquoIrsquom always on the edge, he says. ldquoBecause therersquos a lot of me thatrsquos quite introvert. I donrsquot enjoy that side of my profession. I feel awkward in it.Suchetrsquos heritage has also made him feel dferent in other ways. ldquoI donrsquot know why, but I relate to the outsider, maybe because my blood line is Lithuanian Jew, brought up third generation British, he says. Itrsquos also made him aware of how Britain, and London in particular, welcomes, or doesnrsquot welcome, incomers.ldquoI love London, he says, ldquobut I canrsquot bear hearing people say, lsquooh, itrsquos so full of foreignersrsquo. Do you know why itrsquos so full of foreigners  Because everybody wants to be here and itrsquos a funny thing: everybody that comes here become Londoners, they fall in love with it. We welcome people. Itrsquos the only moment in our conversation where Suchet gets angry.But here, too, there are similarities with Poirot ndash Christiersquos great detective was an immigrant, a Belgian living in London and sometimes coming up against thoughtlessness and racism. What are the other parallels  Both men are fastidious ndash Suchet says he would sometimes drive the costume department barmy with his attention to detail. Both men also despise chaos ndash before he starts a job, Suchet has to start with a completely cleared desk. ldquoI will feel chaos deep within me, he says. ldquoI have to get rid of it, because it affects me. I have to feel calm and ordered, deep inside.We shouldnrsquot exaggerate the similarities of course, but Suchet does talk about an incident that seems to emphasise them ndash for viewers and Suchet himself. It happened when one of the Poirot films was being made in Hastings. There was a break in filming and Suchet had gone for a walk. He was in full costume and standing in an ordinary street. Suddenly a little old lady came up the hill towards him. She stopped. ldquoOoohh. Ohhhh. Hello, Mr Poirot, she said. Suchet didnrsquot know quite what to do so said ldquoHello, madame as Poirot. lsquoOooohh, ooohh,rsquo she went. lsquoI watch you all the time, Mr Poirot. What you doing here, though  There ainrsquot been a murder, has there rsquoSuchet replied, lsquoNo, madame. There has been no murder, not here in Hastings.rsquo lsquoWhat are you doing here then rsquo she asked. lsquoI am on holiday,rsquo I replied, lsquoI am en vacances.rsquo lsquoOh, thatrsquos nice. Lovely. And off she went.Itrsquos a moving little story and revealing about Suchet. He says he didnrsquot want to disillusion the old lady but he was also deep in character when she turned up right in the middle of the serious business of being the Poirot that Agatha Christie created. ldquoThatrsquos my reason for being an actor, he says. ldquoTo serve the writer.It can make it hard to move on to the next stage though, particularly with Poirot. ldquoI got to know Poirot after  stories and  years and Irsquove been in nearly every situation with him in le and I know how he reacts and Irsquove reacted with him because hersquos me. So I know him as well as I would know any best friend. And he dies. Hersquos gone. Irsquom grieving. Irsquove lost a friend. I can bring him back but only in my memory, like Jimmy.Which brings us, via the web of le, to the other metaphor that Suchet used earlier: the escalator, the one that wersquore all and the one that eventually ends. Suchet tells me that he likes to go on retreat to find peace and quiet, but he says there are still little and big fears and concerns that bug him. He worries, for example, about what he calls the dangerous society we live in ndash dangerous because more and more people seem obsessed with fame. You have to be careful not to live your le for other peoplersquos praise, he says.But Suchet also worries about more personal things. In the old days, he says,there was something on his mind, his grandfather Jimmy would tell him to come and sit with him. Often, Suchet wouldnrsquot know what to say but Jimmy would tell him: it doesnrsquot matter, just sit with me. These days, Suchet has his family and his faith.So how does he feel about the escalator of le  ldquoIrsquom frightened of death, he says, ldquoand nobody has come back since Christ to tell me whatrsquos beyond. You get people who say, my faith makes me convinced and I say to them, yoursquore so lucky. But he tries to rationalise the fear. Wersquore all on the same escalator, he says, sweeping his arm round the room. ldquoJust accept it, he says, ldquoDonrsquot worry about worrying.Behind the Lens: My Le by David Suchet is published by Constable at pound.

One positive is that it is now somewhat easier to focus on a smaller number of potential outcomes rather than being overwhelmed by the sheer number of iables.The challenges posed by a no-deal Brexit will have an obvious impact on manufacturing companies that are engaged in import and export with the EU. ldquoWe are dealing with a lot of very niche queries at the moment, related to specic areas and sectors of business, says Livingstone. ldquoThere is clearly a lot of interest in immigration matters and settled status for employees and family members who are already living in Scotland but beyond that there is no one principal theme that is dominating the agenda, the queries we are receiving are all quite business specic.Larger clients, he points out, have the obvious advantage of possessing the personnel and financial resources to cope with that and the more heavily regulated businesses have already done their preparation some time ago. ldquoMany of these companies who already operate outside the EU and have a presence there will have import export procedures in place and while they would see a dference in volume, the procedures would not necessarily be substantially dferent from what they are already used to.It is the smaller companies and those in the SME sector who may not have done enough planning, and businesses who only import from, or export to, the EU who would see the most change. ldquoThese businesses will have to become familiar with procedures that will be new to them, he says.For many the administrative burden seems daunting but Livingstone stresses that there are some major areas that Brodies is encouraging clients to focus on. ldquoIn terms of importing and exporting the main area to address is Economic Operators Registration and Identicationnumbers. This is one of the major things that businesses can take control of. If a business only deals with import or export declarations in the UK, with a customer client completing the equivalent declaration on the EU side of the border, it will only need a UK EORI number andregistered for UK VAT, a number should already have been assigned by HMRC.However,the firm is responsible for completing both the export declaration as goods leave the UK, as well as the import declaration when the goods are imported into the EU,it will need both a UK and an EU EORI number. ldquoThe need to have two EORI numbers in certain circumstances, says Livingstone, ldquois not an issue that has been very visible to businesses.The UK Government, he says has published a series of ldquotechnical notices providing guidance on how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, including  notices on importing and exporting. The notice on existing EU trade deals with non EU countries states the UK Governmentrsquos intention to replicate those EU arrangements in bilateral UK agreements.ldquoThe plan is for the status quo with non-EU countries to be maintained through any transitional period agreed with the EU, but in a no-deal scenario trade with third countries would default to World Trade Organizationrules until a replacement bilateral agreement could be established. Businesses trading with third countries on the basis of EU agreements, whether directly or via their supply chains, should carefully consider how changes to trade rules would impact them .And while some businesses, particularly in the SME sector, are possibly assuming another extension to Article  on the basis of some of the current rhetoric and media reporting around the Benn Act, Livingstone stresses that Parliament can instruct the UK Government but cannot dictate the EUrsquos response. ldquoSo our message to clients is that this is not a situation where Parliament, or any one party, is entirely in control of what will happen.ldquoBusinesses should be aware of the challenges and perhaps the opportunities of Brexit that are specic to them ndash what they are exposed to and what are their sectorrsquos risks in relation to any exit, he says. In short, try to avoid surprises.The right to move goods freely could end this month.Exporting and importing may become much more complicatedIN the event of a no-deal Brexit, the right to move goods freely between the UK and the EU would fall away as of pm on October st, , and trade would revert to World Trade Organizationrules.As a result,you trade with the EUyou may have to comply with the more onerous customs, excise and VAT procedures and rules that already apply to goods traded with non-EU countries ndash in a no-deal scenario the UK and EU will treat goods moving between them in the same way they currently treat trade with those countries .Full import and export declarations, and separate safety and security declarations, may therefore be required.An EORI numberis currently required to trade goods with non-EU countries, and so will also be required to trade with the EU in a no-deal scenario .In a no-deal scenario a range of goods would become liable to tarfs.For goods exported to the EU, the relevant customs duty set out in the EUrsquos Common Customs Tarf would apply.Goods coming into the UK from the EU would become subject to a new UK tarf.This would include imports from the EU .If you export to or import from non-EU countries, you should be considering whether those are among the  or so countries that have a free trade agreement with the EU, andso how the UKrsquos status under that agreement might be affected by Brexit.In any transition period the intention would be for the EU, UK and third countries to continue to act asthe UK remains an EU Member State. If there is no deal the UK Government is aiming to put bilateral agreements in place with the relevant countries as quickly as possible and has already signed a number of ldquocontinuity trade agreements.However, there is likely to be a gap between Brexit and some agreements entering into force, and not all agreements are on track to be lsquorolled overrsquo in time or at all, which would mean trade with the relevant countriesreverting to the same WTO terms as UK-EU trade.Manufacturers should conduct reviews to keep goods flowingIF you are a UK manufacturer of goods that are subject to EU-wide standards you should review whether your existing conformity assessments and certications will continue to be recognised in the EU. You should also review whether you will need to obtain separate UK certication to cover use of your products in the UK.UK bodies approved by the EU for certication purposes will no longer be recognised by the EU, so in a no-deal scenario the results of conformity assessments carried out by those bodies will no longer be recognised either.Products assessed by UK bodies will therefore no longer be able to be placed on the EU market unless they have been reassessed and re-marked by a body that remains EU-recognised, or the manufacturerrsquos files are transferred to an EU-recognised body pre-Brexit. CE marking based on self-declaration of conformity will still be possible, including when exporting to the EU.More detail is available in the EUrsquos preparedness notice and accompanying QA document on industrial products .The UK Government has also published its own guidance on placing manufactured goods on the EU internal market . Meanwhile, the UK Government plans to introduce a new UK mark for new products, to indicate compliance with UK standards .Products that have a European CE marking will still be able to be placed on the UK market, though that option will be time-limited for products certied post-Brexit, and so a duplicate UK marking may ultimately be required.This article appeared in The Herald on the th October For more information please visit www.brodies"},{"url":null,"title":"firm-cash-bid-make-plant-based-construction-material","story":"IndiNature, based in Edinburgh, needs pound. million to build the technology that will produce the material made from UK-grown hemp and flax.Scott Simpson, managing director, has been developing the innovative material for three years and the company aims to be operational by the end of next year.Mr Simpson believes the potential impact of the insulation, which is bonded using a natural binder he invented, is ldquoabsolutely gigantic.He said: ldquoThe construction sector takes about half of global natural resources at the moment and we solve that problem by using renewable resources- annual crops.The industry also accounts for  per cent of global carbon emissions through the manufacture, transport and construction of building materials as well as operational emissions.And at least  per cent of Scotlandrsquos overall waste is produced by the sector, according to Zero Waste Scotland.Mr Simpson said: ldquoWe solve all those problems with our product. We save carbon because we make a really high quality energy efficient system but the biggest impact is that we knock about a quarter of the construction carbon footprint off the average UK house because we store more carbon in the products than the amount that was needed to make them.IndiNaturersquos production is estimated to use around an eighth less energy than standard glass and rock wool insulation, and their use of naturally carbon storing crops that pull carbon dioxide from the air makes their material almost carbon neutral.The industrial hemp and flax crops are naturally resilient too, taking unexpected weather iations such as flooding in their stride.Currently the supply chain is based in the north of England but Scottish farmers who want to revive the traditional crops previously used to supply the navy with anchor ropes and rigging are in talks with the company.It was while renovating his own home with eco materials that Mr Simpson discovered that not all sustainable building products are created equally.After importing apparently eco insulation, he noticed that it was bound with petro-plastics, negating the companyrsquos environmental credentials.He said: ldquoI thought I was doing the eco thing but when I read the text-sheet it said it used petro-chemicals and it was eye wateringly expensive so I thought, why donrsquot we do this here in Scotland With a background in community development, Mr Simpson worked in housing and saw people living in ldquoterrible conditions.He said: ldquoHouses were damp, [people] couldnrsquot afford to heat them, there was black mould and fuel poverty.It was during a masters in Sustainable Architecture that Mr Simpson started developing the materials he now uses to produce the insulation he thinks will revolutionise the construction industry.He said: ldquoI thought,you can solve the built environment problem, you can solve a lot of problems.ldquoIf you know to design the built environment in a holistic way with sustainable materials that will have a huge impact on peoplersquos health and reduce the impacts on the environment.A site had been secured in Hawick to build their first factory, close to their farm supply chain. As well as working with Scottish farmers in the future, IndiNature hope to boost employment in the area.The insulation can be retro-fitted into homes and businesses, allowing for current social housing developments to benefit from the technology. Mr Simpson is in talks with local authorities, contractors and big firms who ldquoknow they need to move into the sector.The company has plans for expansion with their global replication model that will build factories overseas.Mr Simpson said: ldquoI used to be involved with building nice little bespoke homes for wealthy people which is great but there was nothing being done on an industrial scale.ldquoGlobally we aim to be a pound million plus business but with one factory wersquore looking at a poundm turnover.\""},{"url":null,"title":"property-developer-says-giving-dream-build-specialist-dementia-home-bute","story":"The property developer and her husband, Ian, purchased the seafront plot south-east of Rothesay in , and was granted planning permission for her Ascog Park project a year later.However, the land remains empty and Mrs Woollcott says she is on the verge of abandoning the scheme after becoming exasperated with the local council and Health and Social Care Partnership.\"Im at the end of my tether with it now,\" she said. \"Im seriously just thinking about selling the land.

But UK ministers and officials suspect much of the money has not been used for the purpose they insist it is intended.A senior UK Government source told The Herald: ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos accounting is opaque to say the least. Without greater clarity, the suspicion will be that they are not serious about preparing for Brexit.ldquoWhile apparently opposing no-deal they have consistently refused to support a deal. It really does look asthey are hoping for a disruptive Brexit in the belief it would drive support for independence. They need to prepare for Brexit, not prepare for a blame game.One example given was how the Scottish Government was failing to hand over allocated money to local councils so that enough staff could be employed to provide the health certicates that will be needed for Scottish fish exporters to send their produce to the continent post a no-deal Brexit.If the export of perishable fish products from Scotland were disrupted, it is feared restaurants and food outlets such as in France, the Benelux countries and Spain would seek out other producers, which could have a devastating impact on Scotlandrsquos important fishing industry, threatening jobs and livelihoods.David Duguid, the Conservative MP for Banff and Buchan, said he had for months been in contact with local and central government about preparations for a no-deal Brexit but feared not enough was being done in Scotland.He referred to how in February it was announced more than poundm was being made available to the Scottish Government to prepare but ldquonot a penny had made its way to the local authorities.But in the spring, Michael Russell, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary, insisted the money had been ldquodistributed across the portfolios and was being used across the public sector.Mr Duguid told The Herald: ldquoIrsquom in favour of a deal, the UK Government is in favour of a deal but we still have to be prepared for a no-deal.ldquoMy fear is that, should there be a no-deal Brexit, the Scottish Government have not done their jobhellipI hope they are not playing silly games, allowing the fishing industry to fail. What would they saythe rest of the UK was prepared for no-deal and they werenrsquot Askedhe felt the SNP administration was deliberately trying to cause disruption over Brexit to further the independence cause, Mr Duguid replied:ldquoThere is always a suspicion the SNP will use anything to pump up the cause of independence. I hope that is not the case.Meanwhile, a UK Government spokeswoman explained: ldquoThe Scottish Government have received almost poundm in funding for EU exit preparation. It is the responsibility of the Scottish Government to decide where this money is spent to ensure Scotland is prepared for leaving the EU on October .ldquoAdditionally, all three devolved administrations can bid for[money from] the Operational Contingency Fund of poundbn, where they face disproportionate pressures to England.In July, Scottish Labour accused Derek Mackay, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Finance Secretary, of ldquoblowing a hole in Scotlandrsquos Brexit preparations after it was revealed, at the time, that of the pound. million allocated for them in  , Edinburgh had spent around poundm on other things.Of the pound.m allocated for  , UK Government officials say there appear to be no details of expenditure. ldquoThey canrsquot say how they spent it, noted one.Thus far, the Scottish Governmentrsquos extra funds allocated on the back of the UK Governmentrsquos spending on Brexit have been: pound.m in   pound.m in   pound.m for   announced in February and .m also for   announced in August. This brings the total to pound.m.In addition, the Scottish Government has asked for poundm from the contingency fund for Brexit preparations to cover, among other things, support for rural communities in the event of a no-deal outcome, Police Scotland activities, additional communication to EU citizens and poverty mitigation measures.A UK Government spokesman said Edinburghrsquos request would be considered in the ldquousual way. If granted, this would, according to the Treasuryrsquos view, mean the Scottish Government will have received more than poundm for Brexit preparations.Thus far, the UK Exchequer has, overall, made more than poundbn available to prepare for Brexit since the  referendum, including pound.bn specically for no-deal planning.However, funds have been handed over to the Scottish Government via the Barnett Formula, which allocates a proportionate share of departmental spending increases and decreases made in England to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland based on population share.Crucially, while the UK Government might want Edinburgh to spend the money for the same purpose it is being used in England, the Scottish Government is entitled to spend it how it likes.A spokesman for Mr Russell said: \"These are gobsmacking comments from the Tories. Scotland did not vote for Brexit and we should not be having to spend a single penny on Brexit preparations ndash this is similar to an arsonist setting fire to someonersquos house and then complaining about the fire servicersquos efforts to extinguish the blaze.ldquoThe fact is, the Scottish Government has allocated proportionately the same Brexit preparation funding to local authorities as the UK Government from the consequentials received to date. Local authorities can submit further funding requests for EU exit costs through the submission of a business case.

The surrounding wasteland has also been transformed into a landscaped valley featuring paths and sculptures which recognise the arearsquos industrial heritage.Other projects have included the creation of the UKrsquos largest rock ramp, a fish ladder which connects the lower and upper reaches of the River Almond at Howden Bridge Weir in West Lothian. Opened last month, it allows fish to travel upstream for the first time in over  years and is one of a series of projects which has opened km of river to migratory fish species and improved overall river quality.The Tollcross Burn project will restore a section of the previously covered waterway which was culverted through Sandyhills Park in the s to make way for a now demolished housing project.Work will start this month to remove it from its concrete case, so it can once again become a focal point for park visitors, stimulate bioersity and also provide natural flood prevention.Francis Hayes, SEPArsquos WEF Restoration Specialist, said: ldquoIn terms of what you can do to a river, putting it in a concrete pipe and burying it is the worst.ldquoTollcross Burn was culverted in s and erted. Since then, people have been living next to a river but had no idea it was there, they werenrsquot able to see it or enjoy it.ldquoAs a river, itrsquos dead, he added. ldquoFish donrsquot like to travel in dark spaces and canrsquot go up a smooth concrete channel, therersquos no habitat for insects that are vital for river wildle and no light. So itrsquos very dficult for animals and plants to survive.ldquoWe want to make it a living, thriving river.The improvements, which are being carried out in partnership with Glasgow City Council and have received pound.m funding from Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal, will introduce a new -metre open channel which will follow the original course of the burn.As well as improving the natural surroundings, it will help reduce the flood risk caused by the climate emergency and extend the arearsquos sewage capacity. There are also plans to restore and tackle historically contaminated ground in the area.At the same time, work is set to start on measures tomigrating fish to Garrell Burn beside the Dumbreck Marsh nature reserve at Kilsyth.The burn was canalised and while the previously industrial area has now developed into a valued wetland used by runners, walkers, cyclists, pet owners, children and commuters, manmade structures prevent fish from migrating.Work will be carried out by SEPA, North Lanarkshire Council and Scottish Water to naturalise the river, helping to restore flood plains and create fish passes.Dozens of river improvement projects, many of which remove barriers that prevent fish from accessing spawning areas and raised the risk of flooding, have been carried out since the Fund was introduced in .They include work at Gottar Water Weir at Quarrierrsquos Village, Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire, where a post-industrial weir had blocked access to km of habitat for migratory fish species such as Atlantic salmon, sea trout and eel for over a century.The existing weir is to be partly lowered, increasing the downstream water level and improving the water quality, as well as providing new community leisure opportunities.Mr Hayes said there are hopes that improvement works can be carried out at most ndashnot all ndash of the  rivers negatively affected by manmade structures before .The improvement works could help correct two centuries of damage to Scotlandrsquos rivers caused by industrial and urban growth.Prior to the rapid growth of industry and urbanisation of the s, Scotlandrsquos rivers were regarded as being of very good quality. However, river quality deteriorated throughout the th and th centuries, largely due to the discharge of sewage, and agricultural and industrial pollution, and manmade efforts to alter their course which have led to the loss of habitat and prevented fish migration.Since , the Water Environment Fund has helped open up more than km of rivers to salmon and other fish species, while flood prevention work has also been carried out to help make rivers more resilient to the impact of the climate emergency.One of the largest projects is an ambitious partnership plan to revitalise the River Leven, West Dunbartonshire, and turn land which once housed several hundred mills and factories into a lsquogo-torsquo leisure and tourism destination.The project includes removing barriers to fish migration and improving water quality.Mr Hayes said: ldquoPeople were smart in the past but they had dferent information and dferent knowledge from today and we are suffering from that legacy.ldquoRoads, services and railways were being built and rivers were seen as an inconvenience. They were pushed out of the way and then it was a case of lsquoout of sight out of mindrsquo.ldquoWe have damaged rivers and blocked them off to fish. We donrsquot want to hand that legacy to the next generation, so we are trying to do something about it.ldquoBy pulling resources and sharing expertise we can bring a better landscape in often deprived areas. If we restore a river it becomes a nice, natural place people want to be in, it promotes sustainable transport with cycleways and itrsquos a good thing for health and well-being."},{"url":null,"title":"seeds-change-gardening-saving-peoples-lives","story":"The wind was howling and in one of the worst snowstorms in living memory, Francesca Rychel left home without her winter coat and vanished into the wild blizzard.It would take several hours and the efforts of mountain rescue teams and snfer dogs to find her on a nearby hillside, severely hypothermic and barely alive.She woke in hospital days later, furious. ldquoI was angry, she recalls. ldquoI didnrsquot want to be there having to deal with things.ldquoI was so low, I didnrsquot get out of bed.

Left by her bed by a thoughtful nurse, the simple act of planting the seeds and watching them grow would become her motivation to slowly get better.Today, mother-of-two Fran, , is among the volunteers at Space to Grow, a therapeutic garden a stonersquos throw from the Huntlyburn mental health unit at Borders General Hospital in Melrose, which is gently nurturing green shoots of recovery from vulnerable and frail patients.Originally an acre of forgotten land battling against waist-high brambles and choking weeds, it has been coaxed into le by patients, volunteers and staff to become a busy allotment where cheerful flowers bloom and a healthy crop of runner beans, squash, tomatoes, potatoes, courgettes, cucumber and herbs thrive. The therapeutic gardening it provides is increasingly recognised as delivering a range of health benefits, from boosting physical and mental health, to promoting conversation and stimulating thinking skills.In recent years, hundreds of small therapeutic gardens and community allotments have sprung up across the country. Most are manned by devoted volunteers who tease overgrown and unloved land into vegetable plots, mini orchards, flower beds, and where potting sheds double as a focal point for socialising and cups of tea.According to Fiona Thackeray of gardening charity Trellis, which provides guidance and support for almost  therapeutic gardening projects across Scotland, new ones are springing up at an average of one every week.ldquoWhen we first started the charity  years ago, people would look at me a little askance when I mentioned the therapeutic impact of gardening, she says. ldquoBut the evidence has built up such a lot since then.ldquoWe now have up to  new garden projects coming to us every year looking for help and support.ldquoThese gardens are helping people to meet other people, recover from severe mental illnesses, get back to work, regain their motivation and receive support.Some gardens provide a space for refugees to share support and discover what kinds of plants, fruits and vegetables they can grow on Scottish soil.Some in the grounds of nursing homes provide gentle activity for residents with dementia, while community gardens lure lonely people from home to meet new friends. Others encourage addicts to find solace in nature or provide calm space for cancer, heart attack or stroke patients.For Fran, the small packet of seeds, flowerpot and soil left by Jan Moffat, the mental health nurse who developed Borders Hospitalrsquos Space to Grow garden, would be le-changing.ldquoJan brought in a packet of seeds, soil and the plant pot and just left them at my bedside table. I stared at them for a week, then one day decided to plant the seeds.ldquoThat meant I had to get up to get water for them. When they got too big for the pot, I had to get dressed and repot them down in the greenhouse. It meant I had a reason to get up. Then I had to eat because I needed the energy to do what I wanted in the garden. I started to re-engage with le.It was, she adds, ldquotransformational.ldquoI now feel like myself for the first time in  years, she says. ldquoIrsquom working full time and Irsquom able to do more with my children. Without the garden, I might not be here at all.Jan Moffat, meanwhile, has seen the garden bring a range of benefits, from the patient who uses it as a peaceful spot to meditate to another who suffered agitated outbursts but now works off excess energy in the garden.ldquoFor some itrsquos a break from boredom of the ward, she adds, ldquowhile for others that link from nature gives them some respite from how they feel.There are hopes the garden will eventually provide similar therapeutic benefits to other hospital patients in the future.Similar therapy gardens are thriving across the country. At Silverburn Park in Leven, Fe. work is under way to turn a B-listed former flax mill and gardens into a ldquoCentre for Wellbeing while Trellis fieldworkers are supporting volunteers in a revitalised walled garden and sensory garden.In Paisley, a therapeutic garden is supporting ex-offenders, and in North Ayrshire another provides therapy for head injury patients.In West Dunbartonshire, the Leamy Foundation gardens are helping to combat the loneliness and isolation that can lead to depression and anxiety. As well as boosting mood and self-esteem, they are teaching new skills and helping children understand the links between food, waste and nature.Launched after a consultation with local foodbanks revealed around one-third of people attending identied as having mental health concerns, it has led to self-managed gardens popping up on spare plots of land in Alexandria housing estates and in raised beds at St Mungorsquos Episcopal Church, where kale, sweetcorn, tomatoes, herbs and potatoes are growing alongside apple and plum trees and strawberries.A partnership with West Dunbartonshire Council led to a network of community garden and allotment groups, while the foundation has also helped an addiction service launch a therapeutic garden of its own.ldquoWe saw the isolation, anxiety and depression, says project development manager Kevin Mason.ldquoWe wanted to give people of all ages the chance to get out of the house and speak to people about how they are getting on, to share positive things in their lives and help each other.The impact has been ldquoincredible, he adds. ldquoPeople have been helped to move on with their lives and go back into employment because their confidence has grown.ldquoSome of the first people who came to us are now with us as volunteers and helping others.ldquoWersquore giving people a reason to come out and get involved in their community, he adds.ldquoThey enjoy the peace and quiet and the chance to lose themselves in the act of growing something."},{"url":null,"title":"first-woman-climb-every-mountain-scotland-ireland-plans-final-ascent","story":"Her feet ached, she was cold, wet and had trouble walking for days afterwards.Once the discomfort passed however, the -year-old felt an incredible sense of achievement and a calmness that she found boosted her mood.It was that feeling of wellbeing that encouraged her to try again ... and again ... almost every month for the past  years.Next week she is set to become the first woman in the UK to have climbed all  mountains over ft in Scotland and Ireland, and will raise money for Scottish Mountain Rescue during her final trek.Grandmother-of-two Christine, from Carstairs, said: ldquoI never expected to have done so many walks but I just love it.ldquoI enjoy going with friends, but I also like being out on the hills on my own.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

He stated that the application went against ious aspects of council planning policy. He had been seconded by Councillor Owen Tierney.Councillors then voted by ten votes to four to approve the development.• A planning application for the erection of   kV electricity substation at Dounreay, Caithness, which connects to the subsea cable across the Pentland Firth and forms part of the high voltage electricity transmission network and the “National Development”, was consented on September  by Highland Council.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While Be Reasonable Scotland is concerned this new law will turn ‘good’ parents into criminals.This is a concern I share. I have vivid memories of my mum walloping me as a mouthy teenager – but should she have been prosecuted  Absolutely not, she was a great mum, and will be mortiedshe reads this article.: Scotland becomes first part of UK to ban smacking of children: Smacking laws in Scotland: current regulations, proposed changes and how the rest of the UK matches upBack in the s, hitting your kids was standard practice. Things have changed since then, as has language we use. We now talk about ‘smacking’ children, as opposed to hitting them just as we call those things we put our expensive cross-breed puppies in, crates instead of cages. It softens the blow, so to speak.Smacking our own kidsThe fact is, many of us have been driven to give our kids a smack at some point. According to a report by four leading Scottish children’s charities around % of parents in the UK have used physical punishment, with children aged three to seven the most likely to be on the receiving end.The numbers don’t surprise me. Nor do the ages of the children, as this is the time when parenting can be the most challenging. My son was three when I smacked him. Six years on, it still makes me shudder with regret.We were at the start of our holiday and had been travelling for around eight hours. I needed to change his nappy, but he wouldn’t let me. He wouldn’t stop shouting, he wouldn’t listen, he wouldn’t do a single thing I asked. So, in desperation, I smacked his very well padded bottom .And you know what  He stopped. Everything went quiet. And for a split second I felt relief. And victory. But then he turned to me and said ‘don’t you hit me’. Well, he did have a point… And then we both sobbed.A flash of furyThe essential problem with smacking or hitting your child is that it’s done in a moment of madness. It’s a flash of fury and frustration, when all other options have failed.This is what ‘time out’ was created for. It’s not just about punishing the child, it’s about giving the parent time to take a breath and calm their thoughts. There are countless times I have shut myself in the kitchen cupboard, so I can silently scream into the fridge, or bang my head against the cornflakes.I will do everything I can to avoid hitting my children because I know, in my gut, that violence is wrong. I tell me children on a daily basis not to hit each other, so how can I justy doing the same to them  We shouldn’t hit our children just because society or the law say it’s ok, or because they aren’t big enough to hit us back.In fact that is the very reason we shouldn’t hit them. Even when pushed to the limits by a tyrannical toddler, we don’t have the right to use physical violence. Just as those teachers back in the s had no right to hit our children.Many parents today look back on those times with disbelief and horror, and I wonder years from now our children will feel the same about those dark days when parents hit their children.Maybe this change in law marks the beginning of a new era of positive parenting. Where we think first and act later.Or at least try screaming into the fridge.This opinion column first appeared on our sister site the i.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit makes strengthening links between scotland and japan vital says fiona hyslop","story":"It has never been more important for Scotland to strengthen its links with Japan, External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop has said.Speaking as she prepared for a week-long trip to the Far East nation, Hyslop said she would be “exploring key opportunities for collaboration”.With Brexit looming, Hyslop said she looks forward to “strengthening existing relations between Scotland and Japan, and exploring key opportunities for collaboration between our two nations”.The Scottish Government hopes the visit will further build relationships between the two nations, with Hyslop having last visited Japan in .The country is already one of the top  destinations for exports from Scotland, with sales there valued at £ million in .There are also  Japanese-owned businesses operating in Scotland employing , people and with a turnover of more than £. million.She added: “The Scottish Government and its economic development agencies are actively promoting a business environment which encourages growth through partnership and co-investment with our friends in Japan.”A showcase event will highlight Scottish food and drink products to buyers in Japan and Hyslop will also announce the latest awards from a joint £. million research and development fund between Scottish Enterprise and the Nippon Foundation to design new subsea technology.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

This is a fight not just for the twelve hundred workers facing redundancy but for the future of Ballymena. It is not a fight we can afford to lose.”At the weekend a major protest was held at the gates of Green Pastures Church where Wrightbus main shareholder, Jeff Wright, is lead pastor.Hundreds of ex-employees yesterday attended a redundancy clinic in Ballymena following the firms collapse. Former workers queued to fill in claim forms almost a week after the bus manufacturer crashed into administration.The Wright family, who founded the bus-making company in , said the collapse of the business was due to a big fall in demand for buses in the UK market.Meanwhile, a debate in Westminster yesterday heard calls for bus operators to be encouraged with economic assistance to buy British.DUP MP Ian Paisley pushed for the commitment after seeking assurances that potential investors in Wrightbus know what British government support looks like, in terms of research and development, soft loans or grants.Asking an urgent question in the Commons, Mr Paisley asked Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith: Could he recognise that the arms- bodies, such as Translink and First Group and other bus buyers, need to be encouraged directly with economic assistance to buy more British-made buses Could he ensure in future all bus orders go through British companies therefore supporting British jobs and British investment Mr Smith said the government is making any potential Wrightbus bidders aware of what support could be available, adding: This is a commercial process.Its been managed by an administrator and many of the actions are required to take place at a devolved level.But we will continue, and I do continue, to speak actively to all stakeholders in this issue and I am conducting meetings in the course of this week.

He was the le and soul of anywhere he walked into.“He was full of confidence, a real lovely lad. He did a bit of MMA fighting too – he was like a big gladiator and all the lads would have looked up to him. He was obviously able to mask his problems –only he knew how much everybody loved him.”He continued: “This night is a tribute to Caomhin, but it will also help his family out and let them know that the community cares.“It’s also about raising awareness. When people have mental health problems or suicidal thoughts there is not enough being done for them. There’s still a lot stigma surrounding it. They feel that there’s nobody to talk to or that it makes them weak. People need to know they can reach out.”Sean Dobbin, Manager at The Rock Bar, said: “Caoimhin’s death was a massive shock toeverybody. He would have been the type of doorman who would’ve been part of the craic. There was no sign that he was going to do what he did – it was heart-breaking for the whole bar.“The day that he died was the week the Wolfe Tones were at the park so I told Suicide Awareness that they could take our door moneythey sent some staff up. We got just under £, for the charity – I had literally put that message on Facebook and one of the staff told me about Caoimhin.”He added: “The main reason for theis to help his family with funeral costs. If you have a sick relative you can save for a funeral, but it’s hard for his family to deal with the cost because it was sudden.”Tickets for Friday’s event cost just £ and are available from The Rock Bar and Sliabh Dubh, or alternatively can be paid on the door.

Ireland, doesn’t feel that the proposals put forward by Prime Minister Johnson yet form the basis for deeper negotiations.“But there is plenty of time for the UK Government to put forward further

The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push

Coleman and Gerard Hughes exchanged scores in the aftermath of McManusrsquo red card before Nicholson gave Ballycran a - to - lead after  minutes. Two OrsquoPrey frees levelled matters in the st minute, but the drama was still unfolding.A Martin goal in the st minute put Ballycran into a - to - lead and a point from Phelim Savage increased the lead to four points just before the break.To make matters even worse for Portaferry, they had OrsquoPrey sent off after picking up a second yellow card.Ballycran now had the bit between their teeth and scores after the break from Scott Nicholsonand Phelim and Liam Savage had the McKenna Park side almost out of sight.Martin and Woods increased Ballycranrsquos lead to nine points before Portaferry hit back with scores from Colemanand Conor Mageean to leave the score at - to - with  minutes remaining.Another Coleman point left five in it, but Ballycran simply pulled away and claimed the SHC title for the th time.Ballycranrsquos Mick Branf, who managed the side with Gary Savage, was more than pleased with the way his charges went about the job.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable. This team has never put back-to-back championships and then all you have from everyone is that they are one-hit wonders, theyrsquoll get a championship this year, but sure next year itrsquoll not happen, he said.ldquoThey havenrsquot the heart for it, but they showed the heart they have.

The musket and a creative writing workshop as part of the course inspired Greer to write a poem included in the booklet.Course co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said it was a pleasure to coordinate it, explaining that the  participants came from erse backgrounds.ldquoI was fascinated to see how their learning developed over the course, Shirley said. Many discoveries were made and insights gained into the period but, more importantly, into our attitudes and opinions about this part of the past.ldquoBy choosing the title lsquoour shared historyrsquo for the booklet, the participants demonstrated a key part of the learning, showing how intertwined our past is. I was pleased to see friendships developing during the course and a sense of achievement in the creation of the booklet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey mdash who opened the conference mdashpraised the impact the PEACE IV project has had on the community.He said that exploring the legacy of the rebellion and the development of the United Irishmen provided participants with an insight into the heritage of their areas and into the very important topic of challenging preconceptions about history, in particular, the areas of shared and contested history.Cllr Casey said the event also provided participants with a chance to work together ldquoacross the community to discover their own stories and those of neighbouring and dferent communities.Further projects on Crime and Punishment in County Down and lsquoPreserving or Plundering rsquo: Museum Collecting from Hans Sloane to Modern Museumsrsquo will take place next year.

He felt that the delay had caused great inconvenience to a great number of people, who were expected to be moved.CROSSGAR mdash For the third successive year Crossgar soprano Rosemary McKibben has won a major inidual award at the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera.Following her lsquoBest Female Singerrsquo award in , Rosemany retained the Frank Ryan Cup for the lsquoBest Irish Singerrsquo which she won last year.The Belfast Operatic Companyrsquos lsquoMikadorsquo, in which she appeared, took third place at the st anniversary festival.Rosemary also figured prominently in the quartet which was awarded the Wallace Memorial Trophy for the lsquobest concerted itemrsquo and the company lted two other major awards to make its trip to Waterford well worthwhile.Rosemaryrsquos next major engagement is in the demanding role of Donna Elviva in Mozartrsquos Don Giovanni which is to be presented by the Studio Opera Group in Belfast later this month. This opera will also be presented in Down High School, Downpatrick.DUNDRUM mdash Local councillor Mr Jarlath Carey is to meet local planners soon in an attempt to save a major housing project in Dundrum.Mr Carey will be accompanied by Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue, and Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill, who all condemned a refusal by planners this week to allow the project to go ahead.The project is to develop a -acre site to provide about  new private homes and it has been turned down because it is too big.The planners say the proposed development would be out of scale and character with the existing village and would be prominent in the villagersquos landscape.The have also said the site is outside the area considered suitable for future development in Dundrum.A planning spokesman told local councillors at a meeting on Monday that the bulk of new development of this type should be directed at district towns such as Downpatrick rather that to smaller towns like Dundrum.Mr Carey called on councillors to support a plea to planners to reconsider their decision and said he didnrsquot support the philosophy that larger development projects should go to larger towns.TANNAGHMORE mdash A landmark in the Tannaghmore district for the past century was thoughtlessly destroyed this week mdash not by vandals but by DoE workmen.The landmark took the form of a holly tree, which was shaped like an igloo, and had a seat cut inside it, but it was destroyed when workmen carried out hedge trimming operations in the area.The tree, referred to as the lsquoCourting Treersquo or lsquoCourting Denrsquo by generations, had been maintained for many years by Eddie Kelly. He took pride and delight in looking after the tree, and trimmed it three years a year.A feature in the countryside in the Tannaghmore Road area, the tree was once a rendezvous for the couples of yesteryear. The tradition was thatyou were first at the den, you were set for the night!Many couples fromthe nearly Castlenavan, Seaforde, Loughinisland and Drumaness areas visited the tree regularly, particularly around the turn of the century and after.Now, however, the tree is ruined. The hedge-trimming saw the tree almost dissected and what remains could never be trained back to its former self.This ended the lsquoCourting Treersquosrsquo legend and thatrsquos why residents on the Tannaghmore Road are angry mdash that canrsquot understand how the workmen allowed such destruction to take place.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police in Ballynahinch are anxious to trace a lsquobogus doctorrsquo who entered the home of an elderly man at Magherahamlet and stole pound.The lsquodoctorrsquo, about  years old, average height, and slim build, was wearing a long, dark coloured coat when he broke into the house on Saturday afternoon. He was found searching drawers in the h ouse by the elderly resident, who is under doctorrsquos care, but he identied himself as a doctor.However, when he left, the man discovered around pound was missing. He contacted police, who believed the intruder was a lsquobogus doctorrsquo.BALLYKINLAR mdash A new training establishment has been set up at Ballykinlar to increase the skills of the Ulster Defence Regiment.This new instructional base will be used by full time and part time members of the UDR who will be taught to counter the increased sophistication of terrorist activity.The camp is staffed by instructors from the UDR, Regular Army units in the province and others from the School of Infantry at Warminster, and will be assisted by the RUC. To date  UDR recruits have completed a four-week course at the camp.HORSE RACING mdash More than  entries have been received for the Ulster Cesarewich meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse on Saturday.The card produces another bumper programme, following on the heels of the successful August Bank meeting, and the entries have been split over six dferent races.The meeting again has had to depend on sponsorship, as the Downpatrick course continues to do what isnrsquot done anywhere  in the racing world mdash carry on racing without government support.Major William Brownlow, in his annual report recently, said that he was confident that racing would continue at Downpatrick mdash the second oldest course in Ireland mdash for at least another few years. It was dependent, of course on generous sponsorship, as the pound, grant from the government has been ended.He said the local tote would be continued, so that the profit could go back into the course. This is probably the only manually operated tote in the world.DARTS mdash In three weeksrsquo time Dessie Noade, of Downpatrick, will be rubbing shoulders with the greatest darts throwers in the world.Hersquos off to America as a member of the Northern Ireland team for the world championships at the Sahara Hotel Las Vegas, and so far there are no signs of nerves.Drumaness born Dessie began his darts career  years ago and when he moved to Belfast he joined one of the top teams, The Gems, in the highly competitive Dock League..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd October 2019 Hazzard.jpg","title":"Hazzard to defend Westminster seat  ","story":"SITTING South Down MP Chris Hazzard has been reselected by Sinn Fein to defend his seat at the next Westminster election.Speculation is mounting that a parliamentary poll could happen within weeks, with Republicans confident that Mr Hazzard will comfortably retain his seat.Mr Hazzard mdash who was chosen to defend his seat at a meeting in Rostrevor last Sunday mdash said the election was an ldquoopportunity to reject the reckless Tory DUP Brexit and drive forward momentum for Irish unity.The sitting MP said with the ldquochaos in Westminster continuing, the likelihood of an election was increasing every day.He declared: ldquoThat election will be our opportunity to reject the madness of the Tory DUP Brexit and seize the moment to drive forward the momentum for Irish unity.ldquoSinn Feacutein is ready to fight that election and to seize the opportunity to unseat Brexiteer DUP MPs across the North.Mr Hazzard said that in the last Westminster election, the nationalist people sent a powerful message by ing seven Sinn Feacutein MPs, including what he described as a ldquohistoric victory in South Down when Sinn Fein wrestled the seat from the SDLP.The MP added: ldquoGiven the catastrophe that Westminster is attempting to force upon the island of Ireland it is vital that people in South Down continue to show Dublin, Europe and the world that they still reject Brexit, borders and the DUP..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd October 2019 Locals.jpg","title":"Locals seeking JFC glory  ","story":"A NEW name will be engraved on the Down JFC trophy on Sunday evening when Bright lock horns with Aughlisnafin in Newry.Neither side has ever managed to bring the trophy to East Down, but it certainly hasnrsquot been without trying, especially for Bright.The Ballynoe-based side will be playing in their seventh JFC final, but so far it has been a case of not being able to shake off the bridesmaidrsquos tag.Aughlisnafin, the youngest club in the county, will be playing in their first final, but were crowned ACFL Division  champions last Wednesday night and will will be playing their football in Division  next season.The sides have met twice in the league this season mdash honours being shared mdash but both clashes were feisty affairs with no quarter asked or given.Former Downpatrick RGU and Down star Kyran Smyth has transformed Brightrsquos fortunes this season.They just missed out on the Division  title by a single point and are now more than ready for a battle.Smyth and sidekick James McEvoy have built their side around a solid defence where the experienced Barry Mageean holds everything together.He has more than a capable goalkeeper in Michael Farrand behind him and great support in front from skipper Freddie OrsquoConnor, Seamas Tumelty, Cailean Toner, Declan Trainor, Jack McLaughlin, Marc Burke and the dynamic Gareth George.Aughlisnafinrsquos Dolen Croskery, in only his first year in charge, has built his side on similar grounds and in Calum Croskery, Tiarnan Dillon, Sean Willoughby, Sean Fitzsimmons, Shane McCann, Breannain McComiskey, Donagh Steele, Oran Flanagan, Chris Doran and the explosive Adam Garland he has the men for all seasons.Croskery goes into the final more than happy with what has been achieved this year and is already making plans for next season.ldquoAt the start of the season promotion was our main objective and now that this has been achieved the next target for the team is to establish themselves in Division  next season, he said.ldquoBefore that we are in our first ever junior championship final which will give our players a chance to play on the big stage. With the leadership in the team it leaves me in no doubt they will give %, as always.Club PRO and coaching officer Gerard Lenaghan is also looking forward to Sundayrsquos showdown.ldquoI would like thank our management team and the players, especially for their dedication over the past nine months as we look forward to the final on Sunday with great anticipation, he said.ldquoThe squad has a good balance of experience and youth with an abundance of talent at their disposal. It would be remiss of me not to mention also our vibrant and hard-working executive committee who have taken a lot of the pressure off some of our footballers involved at committee level in the week to week running of the club.ldquoThe league success and now a first ever championship final is fitting reward for all our combined efforts both on and off the field. Tada gan iarracht is our club motto mdash nothing without effort, he aded.Bright chairman Marty Ranaghan, who played in several previous finals for the club, is convinced this is their year.ldquoFor many people number seven is a lucky number and hopefully this is our lucky seventh final. We are always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Not this time.

2019 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa resident’s delight after ‘nightmare’ over sewer issue resolved  ","story":"A CRUCIAL meeting has taken place to establish the scale of work required at a private housing development at the Spa to bring sewers, a sewage pumping station, roads and footpaths up to standard.Residents who live at the Carnglave Manor development say they have had to experience ldquonightmare conditions for the past six years and are pleased that the Department of Infrastructure is to formally adopt the estate, which will mean it will be responsible for its upkeep.In December , Stuart Boyd and his young family moved into the estate but what followed was years of ongoing drainage issues due to a fault with a pumping station, with the problem exacerbated by the fact part of the  year-old development had not been adopted by the relevant departmental bodies.Mr Boyd mdash whose family home sits in the middle of the development mdash is the first to be affected by ongoing technical issues with the water pump that regulates drainage, with Carnglave Manor also affected by flooding problems due to heavy rainfall which results in drains overflowing and sandbags being used to stop water reaching residentsrsquo homes.The frustrated resident revealed that within weeks of moving into the new family home, issues started to arise, with the first problem starting in the en-suite shower where water was not fully draining away after the shower had been turned off. Mr Boyd said he checked for blockages but discovered none.The en-suite toilet started to experience problems by not fully draining after flushing, with water rising to the top of the rim. Then a second toilet became affected with the same issue and could not be used.Mr Boyd contacted NI Water and was informed that the problem could not be investigated fully due to the fact that part of the development had not been adopted and that the issue was ldquohistorical.However, emergency action was taken for the problem to be resolved temporarily and the drains were cleared.A matter of weeks later, the same issue happened again and Mr Boyd made contact with the developer who informed him of a ldquoquick fix to resolve the problem.ldquoI was told by the developer that to sort the problem was to restart the sewage station pump by pressing buttons on an electrical , he said.ldquoThis worked fine over the years but became tedious as I had to do it so often. When my we was heavily pregnant with our third child two years ago the problem happened again, but the switch I normally pressed failed to work.Mr Boyd said repairs were then carried out and steps seemed to be taking place to adopt the street in Carnglave Manor. He was also concerned that despite being told a formal adoption would take place, nothing happened.The resident contacted Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis to investigate the issue and is delighted that things are now moving in the right direction as a result of him putting pressure on the relevant departments.Cllr Lewis described the adoption of Carnglave Manor as ldquoan immediate necessity for the progression of completion and resident safety and that the issue had been allowed to go on for too long. He said a process had begun to access so-called bond monies to carry out the necessary repairs.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThere are a number of issues with the equipment which remain unresolved and NI Water and roads officials have been working in collaboration toward ensuring that bond monies paid by the contractor are utilised to ensure that necessary repairs are carried out which would bring the pumping station up to spec for adoption.The councillor said he was ldquohorried to discover Mr Boyd had been educated on the operation of the pumping equipment to ensure proper drainage which sometimes involved him walking down the street in the middle of the night to reset the electronic pump.ldquoI am also advised that residents have in previous years unblocked drains and battled flood waters they have been living in absolute horror. The purchase of a family home should be joyous, exciting and fulfilling. Instead, residents have had to endure misery, worry, stress strain and hassle.Cllr Lewis confirmed that due to frequent periods of heavy flooding in the development he has contacted Rivers Agency requesting flood maps to assessthe area is prone to or at risk of flooding and has asked Land and Property Services to explore the possibility of a rates rebate for Carnglave Manor residents.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said she aware of the situation at Carnglave Manor and, as the developer had failed to complete the site to the appropriate standard, had initiated enforcement action.ldquoThis is with a view to carrying out the necessary works to bring the sewers, sewerage pumping station and roads footways up to adoption standard, she explained.The spokeswoman added: ldquoThe Department is meeting with Northern Ireland Water this week to fully establish the extent of defects in the sewers and sewerage pumping station.

After each appearance in front of their juvenile worships the offending drivers then watch graphic road safety videos featuring more children, with the goal to change driver behaviour.Those behind the scheme say itrsquos a simple but effective idea where PSNI road safety officers will liaise with particular schools about running kidsrsquo courts or teachers as part of road safety classes.When the go-ahead for the scheme is given, police turn up outside schools on the given morning and anyone they detect ndash as long as they are not travelling inordinately fast mdash will have the option there and then of appearing in front of the children, or taking the fine and penalty points.The PSNI is supporting the new initiative, which has proved successful in other areas, with officers hoping that meeting children face-to-face will change driversrsquo behaviour.The districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipis driving the change for an increased focus on road safety across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area with the emphasis on reducing speed to make the areas safer for drivers and pedestrians.And the organisation is fully behind the kidsrsquo court scheme which provides children with an opportunity to talk directly to drivers and send a very clear message about road safety.In addition to the kidsrsquo courts, other measures the PCSP wants to provide include a general road safety awareness campaign across the district, distribution of school safety signs and the installation of speed indicator devices.Local politicians describe the kidsrsquo court initiative as ldquoproactive and say that it will highlight to drivers the vulnerability of children aged between three and  who attend primary schools across the district.They say children will effectively be educating drivers who have exceeded the speed limit outside their respective schools to the potential of what could have happened. Politicians say the scheme is not trying to catch people out, but make the roads safer for everyone.Local councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Willie Clarke have welcomed the new initiative and hope people across the district will be more road safety aware. They believe that working with young people is a very effective way to deliver the road safety message.In addition, they also believe thatthe kidsrsquo court is successful in changing the mindset of even a few drivers it will help make busy roads outside primary schools much safer.Cllr Hanlon said she has been contacted by many primary schools in rural areas, requesting assistance with road safety around their respective locations.She said that with large volumes of children being ped off and picked up within short timeframes, the school run can become a ldquodangerous experience for young pupils in particular.Cllr Hanlon continued: ldquoSchool safety signs will be a visual reminder for drivers to exercise extra caution. Motorists caught speeding outside a primary school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special lsquokidsrsquo courtsrsquo where the judges are children.ldquoIn front of a  of young pupils, drivers will have to explain why they have broken the speed limit and itrsquos hoped that face-to-face interaction will change driversrsquo behaviour.She added: ldquoThis concept not only empowers our young people but also challenges motorists from a childrsquos perspective on why they would break rules which endanger their safety.Cllr Clarke said road safety was an issue he had campaigned on tirelessly over the years and particularly welcomed the introduction of speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoThis has proved every successful in other areas in reducing speed and increasing safety on our roads..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10457892.jpg","title":"bandstand baby witch","story":"Who are the members of your band and what instrument do they play How would you describe your sound What local gigs do you have coming up What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What inspires your songwriting What is your dream gig What is the best thing about performing Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Under a guise of friendship and diplomacy, he has been unbending in the Brexit talks and has subtly pushed northern nationalist grievances. But he is not wrong to say that an extension is better than ‘no deal’.It is now October . The prospects of a radically new Brexit deal, as is needed, before October  are minimal. While the UK must be genuinely prepared to countenance ‘no deal’it is to likely to be able to get that new agreement, there will be political uproar when such a hard exit happens.

We need several more months for negotiations, or, preferably, for a general election that might provide the mandate for a government in such talks.The Benn bill, which forces the UK either to get a deal or to extend, while it is a ‘surrender’ approach to the talks, just as Boris Johnson says, has altered the landscape and means that the much sought after deal is some way away.

Three weeks ago, The Times’ front page reported that the DUP had handed Boris Johnson a leline by agreeing to “sht its red lines in a move that could help to unlock a Brexit deal”.It reported that “signicantly, the DUP has also said privately that it would drop its objection to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea, a measure that it previously claimed was unacceptable as it would separate Northern Ireland ‘politically and economically’ from the mainland.”The paper said it had been told that the reciprocal move from Brussels would have to be an acceptance that Northern Ireland would not be remaining in the EU customs union..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The story was immediately met with a response from Arlene Foster which was intended to sound dismissive, but was in fact vacuous.She tweeted: “UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK. We will not support any arrangements that create a barrier to East West trade. Anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories.”That final sentence caught my eye because it was and is gibberish. Every party – including the DUP – briefs stories anonymously every week, as do whistleblowers.Mrs Foster knows that, so why say something so illogical  We can all say foolish things when under pressure and the exaggerated nature of Mrs Foster’s response hinted at the truth – that the article was accurate and she was embarrassed at the truth emerging without being carefully managed by her spin doctors.In the hours that followed, Sammy Wilson went further, accusing the author of the article, The Times’ respected policy editor Oliver Wright, of “bad journalism”.It has taken just three weeks for the predictions in The Times’ report to be overwhelmingly borne out, with obvious implications for the credibility of Mrs Foster and Mr Wilson.But, perhaps because of the abrupt nature of the DUP’s U-turn, the party has this week adopted a second stance which is nonsensical: Claiming that its willingness to accept an Irish Sea regulatory border is simultaneously both a major compromise and no compromise at all.Boris Johnson’s letter to the EU in which he set out his offer – endorsed by the DUP – of a solution to the Irish border conundrum not only contains the word “compromise” four times but is headlined ‘A fair and reasonable compromise’. in  in the funeral cortege of an IRA man shot dead by the SAS in Strabane.

The key objectors to the backstop – for which Mr Johnson himself voted – have not been the government, but the DUP.The weight attached to this week’s letter from the prime minister is due to it carrying the imprimatur of Mrs Foster, signalling that it is a DUP compromise.The heart of the proposal is for Northern Ireland to be outside the EU customs union, from the DUP’s perspective a substantial improvement on the backstop, but to be largely inside the EU single market – meaning that EU regulations would apply to many of the goods in Northern Ireland, unlike the situation in GB.Of critical importance in Mrs Foster’s eyes is that there would be a role for Stormont in deciding whether EU regulations would apply here.That not only gives the DUP itself, and unionism in general, a say in what will happen, but also goes some way to addressing one of the reasons which had driven some people to vote to leave the EU in the first place – the lacuna of direct democratic accountability in how EU regulations are made. Under the original backstop, there would have been even less democratic accountability, leading to the potential for regulation without representation.From the DUP’s perspective, this new deal is therefore better than the backstop.The dficulty for the DUP is that it sold this issue as one on which it would never compromise on which it said that to do so would be to harm the Union itself. In November , Nigel Dodds told the DUP conference: “Make no mistake… for us the integrity of the United Kingdom is non negotiable....there will be no internal UK border in the Irish Sea.”That same day DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that the DUP opposition to an internal UK border was driven by the “economic necessity” of keeping parity with GB in the very sector which is specied in Mr Johnson’s letter to erge – agri-food. She said that almost two thirds of local agri-food produce is sold within the UK and “cutting Northern Ireland adrt from Great Britain...would be an act of economic vandalism”.That same month Sammy Wilson told the BBC: “If there is any hint that, in order to placate Dublin and the EU they’re prepared to have Northern Ireland treated dferently than the rest of the UK, then they can’t rely on our vote.“They have to recognise thatthis is about treating Northern Ireland dferent, or leaving us half in the EU, dragging along regulations which change in Dublin, it’s not on.”Again that month Arlene Foster told journalists: “Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom. We will not accept any form of regulatory ergence which separates Northern Ireland economically or politically from the rest of the United Kingdom.“The economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom will not be compromised in any way.”A year ago, Mrs Foster was utterly categoric about the issue. When asked by Bloombergshe would “accept any checks across the North Sea [sic], eventhey are of a regulatory nature not customs checks”, Mrs Foster smiled and said: “No, and it’s been very clear all along that has been our one red line – that we cannot have either a customs border down the Irish Sea, or a regulatory border because that would make us separate from the rest of the United Kingdom.”It is impossible to reconcile those words with the position now adopted by the DUP – that because of some as yet unclear role for Stormont in the process, such a regulatory barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would be anything less than what the DUP in its own argument said would be a constitutional outrage.Even the Assembly mechanism which the DUP has constructed was this week sharply criticised by Lord Caine, who until July was the staunchly unionist special adviser to the secretary of state. He warned that what the DUP was proposing would be “used as a proxy for a border poll every four years”.If David Trimble had performed a U-turn as abrupt and consequential, the DUP would have crucied him.Surprisingly, given that the party denied in March that it was discussing cash in exchange for supporting a Brexit deal, Mr Johnson’s letter alludes to a huge injection of money as part of the deal. That opens up the potential for the DUP’s opponents to argue that it has literally sold out to endorse on something which it has said will weaken Northern Ireland’s place within the Union.It may be that the DUP believes that this deal will be rejected by the EU, but will show it to be reasonable and thus avoid the blame for any potential no-deal scenario.But eventhat happens, the party has made a major concession which weakens the strength of any future claims about its ‘red lines’.However it also disproves the overconfident claims of some Brexiteers and DUP members that in the final reckoning it would be the EU which would blink and put pressure on Dublin to compromise.In fact, never realising the magnitude of that for which it argued when campaigning for Brexit, it is the DUP which has blinked.try catch  TrendingIts official -

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Armagh crossroads, plagued with a high level of accidents, is to get a reduced speed limit after intense lobbying by residents.Local MLA William Irwin has been at the forefront of the campaign to have traffic calming at Ardress crossroads.The DUP MLA welcomed additional signage and awareness works at the notorious junction.Crash after crash has beenhighlighted by the MLA and he has echoed the warnings by local residents that ‘sooner or later someone will get killed’.Mr Irwin has been consistently lobbying for improvements and he welcomed what he called a “very focused lobby” from residents in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor this issue and continue to raise their concerns going forward.” PSNI probe ‘serious’ assaults which left victims hospitalisedThieves ransack woman’ home while she was out on volunteer community work

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"around  jobs lost as wrightbus enters administration","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Around , jobs have been lost after Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus entered administration. The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

This is a signicant increase from the current figure of % and is said to be a \"world leading level, ensuring maximum value from wind and other sources\". To achieve this, it is expected that the amount of renewable energy connected to the grid will need to double by .

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.
