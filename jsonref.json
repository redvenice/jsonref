Rapid swab tests, called LamPORE, and 5,000 machines, supplied by DnaNudge, will soon be available in adult care settings and laboratories. If they’re effective, they could allow for rapid, on-the-spot testing. But there’s no publicly available data about the accuracy of these tests or how they perform, raising concerns about why the government has endorsed – and purchased - them.The lab-free testing machine from DnaNudge is potentially exciting. The government has placed a £161m order for these machines, which are currently being evaluated on saliva. If they work, people could be tested for Covid-19 without having to take the nose or throat swab that many find unpleasant. This has particular advantages in children, though it has a low throughput – each machine can complete only a maximum of 15 tests a day. The developers of the LamPORE swab test say they can complete up to 15,000 tests a day, although no real-world data is publicly available.During the pandemic, the urgency that has produced valuable data has also led to the fast dissemination of research and equipment that isn’t subject to normal systems of evaluation, such as peer review. As clinical researchers, we went looking for information about these two new tests, and could find no data on either, despite the DnaNudge website stating excellent performance in clinical studies. The LamPORE website says that analytical performance testing is “ongoing”.LamPORE and DnaNudge are undoubtedly exciting technologies. But the fact the government announcement didn’t even include a “pre-print” publication (the term given to research that is published prior to undergoing peer review) about either test is concerning. According to Imperial College London, DnaNudge was evaluated from April in eight London hospitals.Nobody wants to hinder the development of new, potentially lifesaving technologies. But in order to fully understand how the tests perform in a lab, pre-clinical testing should be rigorous.For a test to be properly validated, a number of conditions need to be satisfied. This takes time. First, a new diagnostic test designed to look for virus genetic material is assessed in the laboratory, using artificially made genetic segments that look like virus. This artificial sample has a set number of copies of genetic material, and it is then diluted down a number of times. Each diluted sample is tested on the device multiple times to see whether it can be detected reproducibly and reliably.This experiment provides what’s known as the detection limit of the test, expressed as the number of “virus” genetic copies in each millilitre of water that can be picked up by the test. The test needs to be run with only water repeated times to check that there are no “false positive” results.Next, you take a nose or throat swab from a Covid-19 negative inidual and “spike” the sample with some of the artificial genetic material from coronavirus, in order to check that the swab or the secretions that are collected do not interfere with the test. Again, multiple tests are done with varying amounts of genetic material in the “spiked” sample.The next step is to access a bank of swabs from patients known to be positive and negative in what’s known as a “gold standard” lab test, such as the tests developed by Public Health England that can quantify the amount of virus present in a person with Covid-19 symptoms. Large numbers of these positive samples, perhaps 50 or more, are tested with the new device. It’s just as important to test a large number of samples from non-Covid iniduals to check that no “false positives” arise.The final step is to test the new device in real time, against a gold-standard test. This step is the most challenging as it sometimes requires ethical approval, and must be done in a clinical environment in real time. When we tested the rapid portable device,  Samba II, in Cambridge, we tested it against the standard lab test in 170 patients.This required significant regulatory oversight and planning. We showed that Samba II produced results in two hours and was highly accurate compared to the standard lab test, and within three weeks Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridgeshire adopted it. And within two weeks of the end of the study, the results of the lab validation and clinical evaluation studies were put online as a pre-print publication for scrutiny.The number of new Covid-19 cases across the UK is now relatively low, so obtaining appreciable numbers of positive Covid-19 patients is more difficult for validating new tests. An alternative option would be to validate tests in countries experiencing high infection rates, though this would be time-consuming and complex.Public funds have been used to purchase these tests, so transparency about their effectiveness is really important. Recent experience where the government purchased millions of sub-optimal antibody tests before they had been robustly evaluated shows the danger of purchasing equipment on the basis of manufacturers’ claims alone.We may be entering an era of trade-offs, where the accuracy of tests is balanced against the number of tests we can achieve. Many see more testing, done in a decentralised fashion, closer to communities and targeting specific at-risks groups, as the best route out of the Covid-19 crisis. In hospitals and care homes, where a single infection can lead to severe consequences in vulnerable people, we need highly accurate tests. In the community, where largely well people need to be tested repeatedly, a compromise between the accuracy, scale and cost of tests can perhaps be reached.• Ravindra Gupta is professor of clinical microbiology and honorary consultant physician at Cambridge Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Diseases, University of Cambridge.

On 5 August 2019, a year ago today, 7 million people were locked into their homes under a strict military curfew. Up to 10,000 people, from young children and teenage stone pelters to former chief ministers and major pro-India politicians, were arrested and put into preventive detention, where many of them still remain. On 6 August, a bill was passed in parliament stripping the state of Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and special status enshrined in the Indian constitution. It was stripped of statehood, downgraded into two union territories, Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir. Ladakh would have no legislature and would be governed directly by New Delhi.The problem of Kashmir, we were told, had been finally solved once and for all. In other words, Kashmir’s decades-long struggle for self-determination, which has cost tens of thousands of lives of soldiers, militants and civilians, thousands of enforced “disappearances” and cruelly tortured bodies – was over.In India’s parliament, home minister Amit Shah went further. He said he was prepared to lay down his life to take over the territories of what India calls Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK) and what Kashmiris call Azad Kashmir, as well as the frontier provinces of Gilgit-Baltistan. He also threw in Aksai Chin, once part of the erstwhile kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir, now a part of China. He was wading into dangerous territory, literally as well as figuratively. The borders he was talking about lie between three nuclear powers. Amid the unseemly celebrations on India’s streets, the extra wattage generated by Kashmir’s humiliation intensified the glow of prime minister Narendra Modi’s already god-like halo. Provocatively, the Indian meteorological department began to include Gilgit-Baltistan in its weather reports. Few of us in India paid attention to the Chinese government when it urged India to “be cautious in its words and deeds on the border issue”.In the year that has gone by, the struggle in Kashmir has by no means ended. In just the past few months media reports say that 34 soldiers, 154 militants and 17 civilians have been killed. A world traumatised by coronavirus has understandably paid no attention to what the Indian government has done to the people of Kashmir. The curfew and communication siege, and everything else that such a siege entails (no access to doctors, hospitals, work, no business, no school, no contact with loved ones), lasted for months. Even the US didn’t do this during its war against Iraq.Just a few months of Covid lockdown, without a military curfew or communications siege, has brought the world to its knees and hundreds of millions to the limits of their endurance and sanity. Think of Kashmir under the densest military deployment in the world. On top of the suffering coronavirus has laid on you, add a maze of barbed wire on your streets, soldiers breaking into your homes, beating the men and abusing the women, destroying your food stocks, amplifying the cries of humans being tortured on public address systems.Add to this a judicial system – including the supreme court of India – that has for a whole year allowed the internet siege to continue and ignored the 600 habeas corpus petitions by distraught people seeking the whereabouts of their family members. Add further a new domicile law that opens the floodgates by allowing Indians a right of residence in Kashmir. The precious state subject certificates of Kashmiris are now legally void except as backup evidence to bolster their applications to the Indian government for domicile status in their own homeland. Those whose applications are rejected can be denied residency and shipped out. What Kashmir faces is nothing less than cultural erasure.Kashmir’s new domicile law is a relative of India’s new blatantly anti-Muslim Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) passed in December 2019 and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that is supposed to detect “Bangladeshi infiltrators” (Muslim of course) whom the home minister has called “termites”. In the state of Assam, the NRC has already wreaked havoc. Millions have been struck off the citizens register. While many countries are dealing with a refugee crisis, the Indian government is turning citizens into refugees, fuelling a crisis of statelessness on an unimaginable scale.The CAA, NRC and Kashmir’s new domicile law require even bona fide citizens to produce a set of documents approved by the state in order to be granted citizenship. (The Nuremberg laws passed by the Nazi party in 1935 decreed that only those citizens who could provide legacy papers approved by the Third Reich were eligible for German citizenship.)What should all this be called? A war crime? Or a crime against humanity?And what should the collusion of institutions and the celebrations on the streets of India be called? Democracy?A year down the line, these celebrations over Kashmir are distinctly muted. For good reason. We have a dragon on our doorstep and it isn’t happy. On 17 June 2020, we awoke to the horrifying news that 20 Indian soldiers including a colonel had been brutally killed by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the icy reaches of the remote Galwan Valley on the Ladakh border. Over the next few days reports in sections of the Indian press suggested that there had been several points of ingress. Army veterans and respected defence correspondents have said that the PLA has occupied hundreds of square kilometres of what India considers to be its territory. Was it just naked aggression as portrayed by the Indian media? Or have the Chinese moved to protect what they see as their vital interests – a road through the high mountains of Aksai Chin and a trade route through Pakistan OccupiedAzad Kashmir? Both are under threat, if the belligerent statements made by India’s home minister were to be taken seriously, and how can they not be?For a ferociously nationalist government such as ours to concede what it thinks of as sovereign territory has to be its worst nightmare. It cannot be countenanced. But what can be done? A simple solution was found. Just days after the Galwan Valley tragedy, Modi addressed the nation. “Not an inch of land has been occupied by anyone,” he said, “no one has entered our borders” and “none of our posts have been occupied by anyone”. Modi’s critics fell about laughing. The Chinese government was quick to welcome his statement, because that’s what they were saying, too. But Modi’s statement isn’t as stupid as it sounds. While army commanders of both countries are discussing withdrawal and the “disengagement” of troops and the social media is full of jokes about the art of exiting without entering, and while the Chinese continue to hold territory they claim to be their own, to the vast, uniformed majority of India’s population, Modi has won. It was on TV. And who’s to say which is more important? TV or territory?Whichever way you slice it, in the long-term, India now requires a battle-ready army on two fronts – the western frontier with Pakistan and the eastern frontier with China. In addition, the government’s hubris has alienated its neighbours Nepal and Bangladesh. We have been reduced to boasting that in the event of war, the US – reeling from its own crises – will come to India’s rescue. Really? Like it rescued the Kurds in Syria and Iraq? Like it rescued the Afghans from the Soviets? Or the South Vietnamese from the North Vietnamese?Last night a Kashmiri friend messaged me: “Will India, Pakistan and China fight over our skies without seeing us?” It’s not an unlikely scenario. None of these countries is morally superior or more humane than the other. None of them is in this for the greater good of humanity.Narendra Modi, India\u0027s Prime Minister since 2014, has triggered several major controversies in 2019.Modi authorises limited airstrikes across the “line of control” in Kashmir. He acted after the Valentine’s Day massacre by Islamist terrorists based in Azad Kashmir that killed 44 Indian paramilitaries. The attack was celebrated in India, but it was unclear whether anything significant had been struck by the fighter jets. Pakistan said the war planes made it up to five miles inside its territory before they were rebuffed, dropping their payloads without casualties or damage.Modi\u0027s party shocked the political establishment by nominating Pragya Singh Thakur, a Hindu nun accused of involvement in a terrorist attack targeting Muslims, for a seat in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Thakur handily won the seat in the May elections and was appointed to a parliamentary committee on defence - from which she was sacked eight days later for describing Gandhi\u0027s assassin as a patriot.Modi is sworn in as prime minister for the second time after his Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 seats, further increasing their substantial majority.Modi\u0027s government pass the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act which confirmed the Superem Court of India\u0027s 2017 ruling that the triple talaq, which enables men to instantly orce their wives, is unconstitutional.Delhi formally revokes the constitutional autonomy of Kashmir in an attempt to integrate it fully into India. The state was formally taken under direct federal control and split into the territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, bringing an end to decades of semi-autonomous rule. The decision to tighten the government’s grip over the region stoked anger and resentment.Modi\u0027s right-hand man, home minister Amit Shah, tells parliament he will seek to have every Indian prove their citizenship in order to root out illegal migrants. The citizenship checks are modelled on a process that took place this year in Assam state which has left 2m people in legal limbo and was criticised by the UN as an enormous blow to global efforts to eradicate statelessness.A new citizenship bill provides a path to citizenship for religious minorities who have immigrated into India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before 31 December 2014. It explicitly lists Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians as being able to take advantage of the new provisions, excluding Muslims. Street protests begin as a result.The first week of August comes with some other milestones, too. Despite the ill-planned, draconian, back-breaking lockdown, despite woefully few tests compared with other countries, confirmed cases of coronavirus in India are now growing at perhaps the fastest rate in the world. Among its victims is our sabre-rattling home minister, who is spending the anniversary in a hospital bed. Not for him the cures being peddled by the quacks, godmen and members of parliament in his party – drinking cow urine, a magic potion called Coronil, blowing conch shells and banging pots and pans, reciting the Hanuman Chalisa, chanting “Go, Corona, Go!” in the flat intonations of a Sanskrit sloka. Oh no. For him the most expensive private hospital and the best (allopathic) government doctors on call.And where will India’s prime minister be?If Kashmir had really been “solved” once and for all, he would be there to be feted by adoring socially distanced crowds. But Kashmir isn’t solved. It’s shut down again. And Ladakh is almost a battlefront. So, Modi has wisely decided to retreat from those troubled borders to a very safe place to make good another long-standing election promise. By the time you read this, he will, accompanied by prayers from priests and people across the country, as well as the blessings of India’s supreme court, have laid a silver slab that weighs 40kg as the foundation for the Ram Mandir, a temple that will rise from the ruins of the Babri Masjid, a mosque that was hammered into the dust by Hindu vigilantes led by members of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party in 1992. It’s been a long journey. Let’s call it a Triumph of the Will.Lockdown or no lockdown, as I write, I can sense the very air trembling in anticipation of the historic moment. Only the naive or the hopelessly indoctrinated can still believe that hunger and joblessness will lead to revolution – that temples and monuments cannot feed people. They can. The Ram Mandir is food for millions of starved Hindu souls. The further humiliation of the already humiliated Muslims and other minorities only sharpens the taste of victory on the tongue. How can bread compete?Perhaps, as the Chinese suggest, in this matter we should proceed with caution. Think a little. Why did Modi decide to inaugurate the Ram Mandir now? After all it’s not the festivals of Dussehra or Diwali, and the date has no particular relevance in the Ramayana or the Hindu calendar. And there’s a partial lockdown in most parts of India – many of the priests and policemen preparing and securing the site have already tested positive for Covid. So why now? Is it to rub salt into Kashmir’s wounds, or is it to put balm on India’s? Because, whatever they tell us on TV, there’s been a tectonic shift on the borders. Big plates are moving. The world order is changing. You can’t bully people and act like the top dog in the neighbourhood when you’re not top dog. That’s not a Chinese saying. It’s just common sense.Could it be that this August anniversary is not actually what it’s being cracked up to be? Could it be instead the little limpet of shame clamped to the soaring cliff of glory?When and if India, China and Pakistan fight over Kashmir’s skies, the least the rest of us can do is to keep our eyes on its people.• Arundhati Roy is a novelist, writer and political activist.

We were in a strip of forest, along a single-track road, making our way towards a huge industrial farm. It was overcast and the high trees made the day even more gloomy.We had been hired to investigate conditions on farms supplying UK supermarkets for a TV programme and not-for-profit campaign, and that was how we found ourselves at this giant pig farm in Poland. The arrival of foreign meat companies in the country was proving controversial. Local people were worried about the environmental consequences – as well as impacts on smaller-scale farmers – of having a multinational meat firm pitch up on their doorstep. We had arrived the day before, sleeping very little before driving for hours into the countryside. I was twitchy, a little nervous, head aching from a night on a lumpy, unfamiliar mattress. We knew the farm was around here somewhere, but weren’t sure which direction to take. And then ahead of us, through the trees, we spotted the lake. At the same time the smell reached us: an appalling stench, one of the worst smells I have ever encountered in my life.This was no lake. It was an open cesspit, a vast lagoon full of waste from the pig farm. Floating beneath the surface were the bodies of pigs in various stages of decomposition. Through the filth we could see snouts and curly tails.Everywhere was the detritus of factory farming – plastic syringe casings, needles and white clinical gloves – floating in the rancid pool and discarded on adjacent farmland. It was the first time I’d ever stepped on to a factory farm. It was a moment I would never be able to forget.I grew up mainly in towns and cities. My experience of farming was limited to those compulsory-but-dull school or Scouts visits to the local dairy, or the livestock you might come across during family days out in the countryside.In the early 1990s, I remember seeing television reports about the BSE scandal and hearing talk about the perils of eating beef. But I was a teenager. I had more important things to worry about. But in 2001, the foot and mouth disaster unfolded across the UK, with its burning cattle pyres and “no entry” signs erected across the countryside. This time I paid attention. The whole episode – devastated farmers, a rural economy in tatters, millions of farm animals culled, political wrangling and endless debates about who or what was to blame – highlighted somehow that something had gone wrong with the way we were farming and producing food.I went into journalism, working freelance for magazines and newspapers. In late 2003 I co-founded a media outfit – part production company, part detective agency – to carry out investigations into environmental and human rights issues, as well as animal welfare. We wanted to use the tactics of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), who’d pioneered using dummy companies, hidden cameras and undercover agents to expose the ivory trade and illegal logging, to work as journalists and also for not-for-profit groups. Business was brisk. Demand for our work was high, and in 2005 we were commissioned to go to Poland.Although we were increasingly aware of the way our food was being produced thanks to the work of journalists such as Felicity Lawrence and Joanna Blythman, for me, as for most people, modern farming remained remote abstraction.But now, here in Poland, I was seeing the reality. In one vast, windowless warehouse, hundreds of young pigs were visible under the artificial lights: moving, squealing, eating, shitting. The unmistakable waft of animal waste and chemicals. Lame and injured pigs – one had an abnormal growth the size of a grapefruit, some looked emaciated, others appeared sick – and dead animals left abandoned on the ground, live pigs rustling around the carcasses. On the wall, charts recording the animals that had died – so-called mortality records – and medication sheets detailing the antibiotics that could be used.Afterwards, the smell stayed with us – on our clothes, our skin, our hair – seemingly for days.Why was our food being produced like this? It was shocking and I wanted to know more.I have now spent the best part of a decade and a half reporting on almost every aspect of the global meat industry. It is a journey that has taken me to farms of all types and sizes, from family smallholdings to vast concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), and into abattoirs, livestock markets, ports and food factories in numerous countries.There is a widespread culture of secrecy and a lack of accountability in the global meat industry, which is dominated by a handful of powerful yet little known corporations. Shining a light on “big ag’s” murkier corners therefore requires months of research, the sourcing of often suppressed data and documents, working with whistleblowers, and undercover investigations.In reality, quite often it’s about seizing the moment. Quickly pointing the camera through an open window or barn door or locked gate, or under a wire fence. You film what you find, first a scene-setting shot, to give a sense of scale and context, then close-ups to bring details to life.Sometimes, if you are following up a tipoff about a particularly problematic farm, what you see might be distressing – a pile of dead and dying chickens a spent dairy cow, sprawled out on the floor taking its last gasps an injured sheep, still alive, maggots in its wounds – accompanied by a backdrop of ear-deafening squeals or incessant grunts from confined livestock or the nauseating smell of waste as you try to focus.It always feels like you’ve stayed too long, even if it has only been seconds. You worry you haven’t got enough pictures – farms are inevitably dark and not conducive to cinematic beauty – and you pray the camera has done its job.Often, there’s simply too much happening to know where to point the camera, such as when a shedload of chickens are being rounded up for slaughter, workers swarming around you in near-darkness.Some of the farmers I’ve visited over the years are happy to have us they’ve nothing to hide and welcome the opportunity to talk about the challenges of making ends meet. Sometimes – particularly in the case of large corporate-owned farms or slaughterhouses – open filming isn’t an option. You have to rely on undercover reporting and hidden cameras.In the old days you could do it and worry about the details later, as long as you used common sense, adhered to biosecurity and basic health and safety rules. Now, any covert reporting has to be cleared in advance by editors and lawyers and requires lots of form filling, to make sure there’s public interest and justification. That’s as it should be, but it certainly makes things more complicated.As a journalist, it’s my job to go and see for myself the worst conditions that I hear about. In Italy, on farms supplying “artisanal” parma ham, I saw pigs held in battery conditions, with animals confined in metal cages – gestation crates, or sow stalls – designed for those that have been recently inseminated. They had no room to turn around: the cages weren’t much wider than the pigs themselves.In Portugal, I saw pigs being repeatedly hit and dragged by the ears, squealing, on to transporters before starting their journey to slaughter. In Spain, thousands of quails – reared for their eggs – were crammed into filthy battery cages, many having lost feathers and others dead and left to rot. Calves, too – some subject to journeys on trucks that take days – confined in solitary pens as part of the veal trade.In Bulgaria, I visited primitive horse and donkey farms, including one where animals were fixed to the wall or floor with rope and chains. Some had little, if any, straw or other bedding. At one farm, the corpse of a horse lay sprawled outside, blood visible on the ground. Similarly, in Croatia, I saw cattle tethered day and night in darkened sheds, some never having set foot on grass.In Chile, I saw vast offshore “floating feedlots” with thousands of salmon packed into underwater cages. In the UK – at one of the country’s biggest intensive beef farms – we saw cows caked in excrement and other waste in flooded, dirty yards with no protection from the elements.And in poultry units across Europe, time and again I’ve seen broiler chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese crammed into vast, crowded sheds with no outside access. Each morning on these farms, workers remove the birds that have died overnight. Sometimes a handful, sometimes scores of birds, flung into piles on the floor or loaded on to wheelbarrows, and chicks disposed of – some still alive – into skips piled high with carcasses.These scenes illustrate the virtual worthlessness of inidual birds. On some farms, hundreds of birds can die each week – in the UK, more than a million chickens die before reaching the slaughterhouse each year.The chain doesn’t end on farms. Animals have to be processed into meat, and slaughterhouses have faced repeated allegations of cruelty, despite supposedly stringent oversight in many countries.I’ve been inside poultry and rabbit abattoirs. I worked undercover in Portugal, capturing footage at a slaughterhouse specialising in suckling pigs, usually roasted whole as a popular treat. The graphic scenes we filmed caused uproar in a country where few people had seen how their meat was being produced.After being unloaded, the pigs were taken to a stun room containing a series of small holding pens where a worker, using what looked like a large pair of tongs, stood among the squealing animals and calmly applied a shock to each one’s head before shackling the bodies on to the moving production line which carried them up through a hatch in the wall.Some twitched involuntarily after being attached to the moving rail, others appeared to be fully conscious as they moved along the line, eyes open and kicking, into the kill room. Here, a worker plunged a large knife into each pig’s neck, causing a gush of blood to shoot down into a tray below, and holding each pig by the legs as they began to “bleed out”.The slaughterman offered me the knife in case I wanted a go. I declined.Where cameras can’t go, you have to rely on other evidence. Unpublished reports by UK vets and hygiene inspectors that I obtained detailed thousands of – apparently industrywide – breaches of welfare regulations, including instances of chickens and pigs being boiled alive after being immersed into tanks of scalding hot water, used to soften the skin and remove hair or feathers.The smell and sounds and frenetic activity of an abattoir don’t leave you. The whirring of machinery, the clinking of chains, the animal cries, the shouts of workers, the steam, the blood and offal carcasses swinging on the line. The animals may be stressed, but you wonder also what impact this has on the workers who do this, day in, day out.The effects of these industrial systems are not just felt in the farmyards or the slaughterhouses. I have seen the wider impact of the quest for food miles away from the farms. Animals that once lived off the land, or off waste, are now given bags of expensive industrially produced feed the need to fatten them as quickly as possible demands huge inputs of protein, and that protein is pulled from all over the world.Soy is one source. I’ve reported on the well-known problems with deforestation but I’ve alsowritten about some of the chilling human rights abuses connected to the industry in Paraguay, where much soy was destined for factory farms in China and Europe. Peasant and indigenous organisations had been protesting against the encroachment of the soy farms on their land. The response from some of the soy farmers – with the backing of police and paramilitary units – was brutal: violent evictions, shootings and beatings, resulting in numerous injuries and several deaths, as well as arbitrary detentions and disappearances.Fishmeal is another source of protein with its own impact, as I saw in Peru. Yards away from the bustling port of Chimbote, lying on the rubbish-strewn beach, were the carcasses of about six sea lions, quietly rotting in the sunshine. Their normally grey silky skin had turned a rusty, orange hue. One carcass, its eyes long since gone and tongue spilling out from its swollen body, was swarming with flies.The sea lions had been slaughtered by local fishermen, who saw them as competitors for dwindling fish resources in this part of the Pacific. Demand for anchovy – hoovered up for use in fishmeal and fish oil – had impacted on the sea’s natural food chain, and reduced stocks of previously plentiful species fished for human consumption.Forty fishmeal factories were processing anchovies caught by the city’s fleet, and the area had become a major flashpoint for conflict. (New fishmeal frontiers in west Africa and Asia have joined the party, bringing fresh problems.)I visited one poor community where more than a dozen women and children gathered in the dusty, unpaved street to vent their anger at pollution from the fishmeal plants: they claimed they were responsible for asthma, bronchial and skin problems, particularly in children.Footage filmed by residents showed conditions when plants were operational: billowing black smoke drifted through the streets, obscuring vision and choking passersby. It looked like the aftermath of a bomb.According to environmentalists, the sea in Ferrol Bay off Chimbote was now becoming a “dead zone”, largely due to contamination from the fishmeal industry. The plants were accused of discharging protein, fat and oil into the bay, as well as contaminated marine water used during the process of pumping fish from the ship’s hull to the processing plant.I remember looking at the ocean stretching out in front of us, and feeling anger and bewilderment that it was being choked of life – quite literally – largely to feed livestock confined in far-off farms.So how did we end up with this system? Industry chiefs I’ve interviewed argue that factory farms exist because of the demand for cheap meat, and that producing enough of it efficiently to meet that demand is possible only by using intensive systems.They point out that supermarkets – arguably the biggest champions of cheap food – require reliable and consistent supplies that meet exact specifications, all year round. Sourcing on such a scale simply wouldn’t be viable if they bought only from the smaller, independent family-owned farms run in the traditional ways.And despite the furore around the spread of megafarms, size isn’t an indicator of the welfare standards they maintain in fact larger, more modern units are often superior, with hi-tech systems and good veterinary care.Despite what I’ve seen, experience tells me that the majority of livestock farmers are decent, hardworking folk who do their best to make a living in an industry where money doesn’t readily flow down to the small guys, and where margins are often so slim that any unforeseen event can prove catastrophic.I have spoken to dairy farmers who are trying desperately to keep their businesses afloat but acknowledge that, at some point, their farms will have to close, despite in some cases being in the same family for generations. I’ve spoken to beef farmers – some of whom quietly expressed criticism of the intensive feedlot-style cattle farms popping up across the UK – that have dedicated themselves to offering higher welfare, grass-fed beef sold directly to the public as an alternative to cheap supermarket products.Many of these farmers are as much victims of the system as their livestock.In the age of hyper-cheap food you can pick up a whole chicken for a few pounds, and a pint of milk for less than a bottle of water. Yet these prices fail to reflect the true cost of production. The terms dictated by supermarkets and processing companies put too many farmers in the grotesque position of losing money on the foodstuffs they’ve spent weeks, months or years producing.It’s the sheer scale of production, driven by insatiable demand, that is the problem, fuelling bigger farms and more intensive systems – the more animals you can squeeze in, the more food you can produce, the more money there is to be made.Megafarms that house thousands of pigs, poultry, beef and dairy cattle are now common. But when things go wrong – fires, floods, disease outbreaks, equipment breakdowns, pollution – the bigger the farm, the bigger the consequences.Coupled with vertically integrated supply chains and controversial contract farming models – which, critics say, outsource many of the financial risks to farmers – this has unavoidably created a system which has turned farm animals into mere commodities. “Meat machines”, as one campaigner put it.The language used in the poultry industry illustrates the point: industrially produced chickens are no longer referred to as birds but as “crops”, in the same way as you might refer to a field of lettuces or tomatoes. Chicken producers can be referred to as “growers”, not farmers, and it comes as no surprise that they are not paid for inidual birds, but for the weight each “crop” of chickens achieves.As one UK farmer told me, modern chicken sheds are simply “petri dishes of live protein-on-legs”.About 70 billion land animals are produced globally for food each year, an estimated two-thirds reared in intensive conditions. Many of the issues this raises, and which I’ve covered extensively – food safety, antibiotic resistance, animal welfare, exploitation of workers, pollution, deforestation – are now firmly on the global agenda and commanding attention.The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted renewed calls for change: in the US, some politicians are calling for the biggest factory farms to be phased out by 2040. Even the UN is urging a rethink of industrial farming, citing links with zoonotic infections and the widespread use of arable land for animal feed, driving deforestation.Addressing the question of how the world produces enough meat, safely and sustainably (and humanely), to feed a growing population while safeguarding the environment, is more relevant – and more complicated – than ever.I’ll leave it to scientists and others more qualified than me to answer this question. But, thinking back to that squalid farm in Poland, and everything I’ve seen since, I can safely say one thing: we shouldn’t do it like this.This is an edited extract from a longer version of this article, which can be found on Medium"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936c0b105d58b82b2a988d0eba4748aafbe7bbbc/0_170_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12fa8ce003a759fdbd7f9b583913858b","title":"tesco urged to ditch meat company over alleged links to amazon deforestation","story":"Responding to Greenpeace campaign to cut links to Brazilian meat giant JBS, supermarket calls on government to ensure all UK food is deforestation-freeTesco has called on the UK government to order food companies to ensure all food sold in the UK is deforestation-free. The move comes in response to a new Greenpeace campaign calling on the supermarket to cut links to JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, over its alleged links to farms involved in Amazon deforestation.The supermarket says the UK should introduce due diligence across supply chains to monitor for deforestation. Germany is also weighing up a due diligence law on supply chains, reportedly supported by Angela Merkel. And more than half of Britons would consider rejecting meat products linked to deforestation, a YouGov poll for Greenpeace has found.“Today we call for our government to mandate food companies, as part of its National Food Strategy, to introduce effective due diligence across supply chains to make sure all food sold in the UK is deforestation-free,” said the Tesco group chief executive, Dave Lewis, in a statement. “We are making tangible progress but we can’t solve this on our own.”But Tesco said that while it has blocked Brazilian meat sales since 2018, it will not delist two JBS-owned meat suppliers. JBS said it was committed to ending deforestation throughout its supply chain.“Cattle ranching is the biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon,” said Anna Jones, Greenpeace UK’s head of forests, describing the world’s biggest rainforest as “a big beating ecosystem that helps to regulate the climate and plays a role in climate stability.”JBS has been linked to farms involved in Amazon deforestation five times in just over a year. Investor Nordea Asset Management has dropped the company from its portfolio.In 2009, following a Greenpeace report exposing the role of Brazilian meat companies in Amazon deforestation, JBS and other Brazilian meat companies committed to controlling their “indirect suppliers” by 2011. Greenpeace said JBS is “still slaughtering the Amazon” in a new report also released on Wednesday. “JBS continues to have a problem,” said Jones. “It does not have full transparency.”“Setting fires to clear land for crops or grazing is destroying precious habitats like the Brazilian rainforest. It must stop. That’s why we support Greenpeace’s aim to prevent further Amazon deforestation,” a spokesperson for Tesco said.But delisting Moy Park and Tulip – which also supply Aldi, Co-op, Lidl, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose – “could lead to thousands of job losses, impact British farmers and ultimately compromise our ability to offer fresh British meat and chicken to our customers,” Tesco said. “We recognise that the UK as a whole needs to reduce meat and dairy consumption.”In Brazil, an expensive army operation to combat fires and deforestation has been widely criticised as ineffective by local media, and the government has been reluctant to admit it has a deforestation problem.“Brazil is one of the few countries in the world that is able to produce and preserve,” agriculture minister Tereza Cristina Dias said in a video speech to the Brazilian Agrobusiness Association on Monday. “We have improved our livestock farming, reducing the use of land and increasing productivity.”In response to Greenpeace’s claims that the company is indirectly sourcing cattle from farms in the Amazon involved in deforestation, a spokesperson said: “All JBS subsidiary companies adhere to strict responsible procurement policies throughout their supply chains and share our dedication to eliminating deforestation for good.”“We have been at the forefront of the industry in taking steps to improve supply chain traceability in Brazil. We are working closely with national and local government departments to develop solutions and system improvements around supply chain traceability and best agricultural practice to eradicate deforestation.“JBS will continue to evolve continuously in new initiatives and plans in the coming months to promote significant changes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c82ae1bf918e26aa4661c303ed8909fb2269205/0_1311_2161_1296/master/2161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c76670cce683ea2fbbfcfdc58e9a5d4","title":"throng of new penguin colonies in antarctica spotted from space","story":"The discoveries were made by spotting the distinctive red-brown guano patches the birds leave on the ice. The finds were made possible by higher-resolution images from a new satellite, as previous scans were unable to pick up smaller colonies.Two of the colonies were a particular surprise. They were found far from the coast, living on sea ice that is anchored to grounded icebergs, a location never seen before.Emperor penguins are the only penguins that breed on sea ice, rather than land, making them especially vulnerable to the climate crisis. All the new colonies are in areas that are at risk and researchers say these will be the “canaries in the coal mine” as global heating increasingly affects Antarctica.Philip Trathan, also at BAS, said: “The new breeding sites are all in locations where recent model projections suggest emperor penguins will decline. These birds are therefore probably the canaries in the coalmine – we need to watch these sites carefully as climate change will affect this region.”Fretwell said one of the colonies was 112 miles (180km) from the Antarctic continent: “Many of the penguin scientists we have talked to were disbelieving, as normally you expect them to be at the coast.” Emperor penguins need stable sea ice, usually attached to land, for nine months of the year to breed successfully.There were only 30 colonies known a decade ago, as they are usually in remote and inaccessible locations, where temperatures can fall as low as -50C in winter. But then Landsat satellite images began to be used. These have a resolution of 30 metres, which is enough to spot the larger colonies.The European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite was launched in June 2015 and has a resolution of 10 metres. This enabled a search for the smaller penguin colonies, as reported by the BAS scientists in the journal Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation.Emperor penguins were expected to be present at fairly regular intervals around the coast of Antarctica, so the search was targeted in areas where none were known. “In every gap where we thought there might be a colony, we found one,” said Fretwell.Three of the 11 colonies found had been suspected following ship or aeroplane sightings of penguins in the 1960s and 1980s, but Sentinel-2 images confirmed their presence. There are now 61 known emperor colonies around Antarctica. “There may be one or two very small colonies yet to be discovered, but I think we have filled in all the gaps now,” said Fretwell.The next step is to direct satellites with very high, 30cm-resolution cameras over the colonies to enable the penguins to be counted. “It is dark at the moment in Antarctica, so we can’t count them yet,” said Fretwell. “The sun will come up either later this month or next month in most of these locations, and then we will start.”• This article was amended on 5 August 2020.

LGBT content was removed from Bohemian Rhapsody, Star Trek: Beyond, Alien: Covenant and Cloud Atlas, scenes where Chinese people were killed were taken out of Skyfall and Mission: Impossible III and a major character was changed from Tibetan to Celtic in Doctor Strange, a decision made by the screenwriter to avoid the risk of “alienating one billion people”.In the report, Stanley Rosen, professor of political science and international relations at the University of Southern California, says that the government “will focus on everything that has a China component in it. Don’t think that if you’re doing something that’s not intended for China, that’s an indie film meant for a small market, that China won’t notice and that it won’t hurt your blockbuster film. It will.”The report recommends that “Hollywood studios commit to publicly sharing information on all censorship requests received by government regulators for their films”.In 2019, American films made over $2.6bn in China with Avengers: Endgame, Spider-Man: Far from Home and Fast \u0026amp Furious Presents: Hobbs \u0026amp Shaw making more money there than in the US.The release of the report comes after the US government has openly criticised Hollywood for kowtowing to Chinese intervention, also blaming the studios for pre-emptively censoring or canning potentially difficult projects.“Many more scripts never see the light of day because writers and producers know not to test the limits,” the attorney general, William Barr, said in July. “Chinese government censors don’t need to say a word because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist party.”In June, Richard Gere appeared before the US Senate to warn about the dangers of letting China control content. “The combination of Chinese censorship, coupled with American film studios’ desire to access China’s market, can lead to self-censorship and overlooking social issues that great American films once addressed,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53d751967bb4cc794cec06d0ece562e6826c6c9d/0_192_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43f0a46471093cb944515756a37048b7","title":"disney opts for digital first release of mulan shocking cinema owners","story":"Mulan is first blockbuster to go straight to streaming in response to Covid-19 shuttering cinemasDisney’s decision to bypass cinemas and offer its latest big budget film Mulan directly to streaming subscribers for $29.99 could signal the beginning of the end for the traditional movie-going experience – and forever change the long-established business model underpinning the Hollywood blockbuster.The surprise move has stunned cinema owners, who had been banking on the film, along with Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi thriller Tenet, to jump-start box office takings as theatre chains struggle to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.The move is seismic given Disney’s utter dominance of the worldwide box office – the company made a record $13.2bn in ticket sales last year – with cinema owners believing it would be the last Hollywood studio to look at threatening the 70- to 90-day exclusive “theatrical window” they have enjoyed at the top of the pecking order for newly released films before they head to other platforms.The Hollywood studios have used the pandemic to experiment with more digital-first output, though to date these straight-to-streaming releases have tended to be small to mid-size budget titles, or projects that the studios have lost faith in as potential box office hits.Mulan, which was expected to be the latest $1bn-plus grossing film from the Disney hit machine, is the first bonafide blockbuster to go digital-first.Disney revealed its plans as it reported a $4.7bn loss in the quarter to the end of June, its first loss in two decades, as its business suffered from theme parks and cinemas being shut.The one bright spot was its new streaming service Disney+, which since launching in November has passed 60 million subscribers globally, four years ahead of internal projections, giving the company the confidence to test-release one of its marquee films online first.Mulan will still premiere in cinemas in countries where Disney+ is yet to launch, however.Bob Chapek, Disney’s new chief executive, tried to downplay the move, telling investors it was a “one-off” and not a permanent strategic shift. However, he admitted it would be an invaluable experiment to find out how much it boosts new subscriber sign-ups to Disney+ and digital revenues.Global box office revenues hit an all-time record of $42bn last year, representing a huge slice of income that Hollywood studios will not want to see disappear, assuming movie-going returns to normal.However, film studios get a much greater cut of revenue from going direct-to-digital than they do at the box office, which means films do not have to make as much money to be as profitable. If half of the households that subscribe to Disney+ were to stump up $29.99 to watch Mulan, less than the cost of a family trip to the movies plus treats, the film would gross $900m.In May, Universal studios made the first significant digital-first move, deciding to give the DreamWorks-made Trolls World Tour a premium video on demand release at $19.99 instead of delaying its planned cinema premiere.The company subsequently revealed that the film had made $100m in its first three weeks in the US. By comparison, the first Trolls film earned just over $120m during its entire five-month run in US cinemas.Emboldened by its success, Universal said it intended to begin releasing some films digitally at the same time as in cinemas after the Covid-19 crisis ends Those comments prompted the world’s biggest cinema operator– AMC, which owns the Odeon chain – to issue a global ban on screenings of all films from the maker of the Fast \u0026amp Furious and Jurassic World franchises.Since then, as the pandemic has kept cinema doors closed in the US, the world’s largest movie market by some distance, AMC has softened its position. Last week, Universal and AMC struck a deal to reduce the time some films will stay exclusively in cinemas to just 17 days before they can be made available as a premium video-on-demand product.However, analysts believe that while the pandemic has provided perfect lockdown conditions for releasing films digitally, it does not spell the beginning of the end of the big cinema blockbuster.“It makes sense during the lockdown to experiment when there is pretty much no box office performance for a film to achieve,” said Richard Broughton, analyst at Ampere. “The straight-to-digital strategy may make sense for smaller titles but it doesn’t for blockbuster films when cinemas reopen properly, even if the theatrical market is depressed next year.”Studios are still looking to push back most major titles such as the latest James Bond outing No Time to Die, Wonder Woman 1984, the Minions sequel, the next Fast \u0026amp Furious film and Marvel’s Black Widow, hoping for a profitable global cinema release.There are other significant issues making a total shift away from cinema releases unlikely, at least for now. Broughton said that US consumers are much more accepting of higher priced digital films than those in Europe and other regions, meaning the maths on international revenues is unlikely to add up.In addition, countries including China have tiny digital-video rental usage, which would severely limit income. Whereas China boasts the world’s second-biggest cinema box office market, at $9bn a year under normal conditions.• Judd Apatow’s Pete Davidson-led comedy King of Staten Island• Scooby Doo update Scoob!• Artemis Fowl• Tom Hanks’s Greyhound• Disney’s live recording of stage hit Hamilton• Onward• The Invisible Man• Vin Diesel vehicle Bloodshot"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b0a541042f6b8822bdb236ecfaca090709fa8d5/235_0_3598_2160/master/3598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=316af9b7bb4a692c34981b0e0f764f00","title":"echo review","story":"Universal themes are enlivened with local detail in this poignant, painterly compilation of 56 single-shot vignettesDon’t waste time looking for a narrative thread or common character in Echo. The third feature from director Rúnar Rúnarsson is a series of single-shot vignettes (56 in total), connected only by their setting: Iceland, around Christmas and new year.The brevity of these scenes doesn’t prevent them depicting nuanced emotions: a teenage girl visiting her father is shown up at the piano by his new girlfriend’s daughter. Or delivering political commentary: a man listens to a radio broadcast about a union dispute while toiling in his workshop. Echo also takes full advantage of each new scene-setting opportunity by presenting us with an abundance of aspirational interiors, impressive landscapes and meticulous mises en scène. The cumulative effect is like strolling through a Reykjavik gallery where each painting moves within its well-chosen frame.Foreigners get a slice of Icelandic life, but the balance between universal themes and local detail is well struck in gently comic scenes, such as the one where a librarian takes a call from his mother to discuss food at the upcoming family get-together: “No, I’m not eating whale meat … Because I don’t eat whale meat … If Dad and you want to eat whale then you do that and we’ll come later … Yes, tell him that.”The scenes that leave the most lasting impression, however, are those featuring a display of storytelling virtuosity. We’re introduced to characters one moment – a drug addict and his kind outreach workers, for instance – then moved to tears by them the next. It’s a wonderful (Icelandic) life. Echo’s surprisingly cockle-warming take makes it a worthy contender for your alternative Christmas classic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3659159036aaf9ebcb4a7cb139730469b16e58a8/0_0_5645_3388/master/5645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cd248b35ca67b92e59a332ff5bb1d9b","title":"17 ways salad dressings oil vinegar tahini couscous","story":"Salad dressing basics are simple: oil, vinegar, salt. After that, it’s a feast of gorgeous brews to shake, stir, blend, blitz and drizzle over anything from chicken to couscousFrom time to time, you meet people who say: “I can’t make salad dressing.” On the face of it this is a bit like admitting you can’t ride a bike or tie shoelaces, but what they really mean, I suspect, is that they don’t want to make the salad dressing. They want you to make the salad dressing.That’s because although dressing isn’t complicated, it is a bit of a responsibility, requiring a delicate balance of elements. Decisions have to be made, and your judgment may come into question. At its most basic, a salad dressing comprises three ingredients – oil, vinegar, salt – but an old proverb recounted by Marcella Hazan in The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking holds that the perfect salad needs four people to dress it: “A judicious one for the salt, a prodigal one for the olive oil, a stingy one for the vinegar and a patient one to toss it.”If you’re going to make salad dressing in this time-honoured, high-wire fashion – right there, on the leaves, in front of everyone – this is all the recipe you need. Do things in that order – salt first, then oil, then vinegar – and be all four people. For the 16 variations that follow, a little more preparation may be required.Jamie Oliver’s basic French dressing adds chopped garlic and mustard to the mix, and offers up an inviolable ratio for successful dressing: three parts oil to one part vinegar. He also unveils a simple technique you can use for all sorts of dressings: put all the ingredients in a jam jar with a tight lid, so you can shake them up just before pouring.Felicity Cloake’s authoritative vinaigrette employs half a teaspoon of honey as sweetener and binding agent (oil and vinegar separate as soon as you turn your back on them). She also uses the 3:1 oil to vinegar ratio, even though 2:1 is commonly recommended elsewhere – a blend Cloake dismisses as too acidic.Those are the basics from which endless variations may be spun, with additions, omissions or replacements. You can substitute lemon juice for vinegar, as in this recipe for rocket with a charred lemon dressing, where the lemon is first halved and then charred, cut side-down, in a hot pan. I’m not sure how much difference the charring makes, even after trying it a few times, but surely no harm can come from it.Anna Jones’s crisp garlic dressing adds chilli and just-browned garlic slices, with lime juice instead of lemon, to top a salad made entirely of herb leaves: coriander, basil, parsley, dill and mint.If you’ve got fresh herbs wilting in your fridge, past all use as salad leaves, they can be incorporated into the dressing itself. This tip from Lisa Marie Corso revives tired herbs – any you’ve got, in whatever combinations you fancy – by whizzing them up with garlic, oil, lemon, and salt and pepper. The result is a bit like a chimichurri, and can also be employed in that fashion as a sauce for meats.Slightly more exotic, but not much more complicated takes include pomegranate dressing the most difficult aspect of which might be finding a pomegranate. It can be used on green salad, rice salad, couscous or any number of largely interchangeable grains. Gill Meller’s tahini dressing is perfect for a salad of aubergine, courgettes, lettuce and seeds.This sesame dressing will work on any sort of noodle salad. It’s a straightforward blend of sesame oil, lemon, chilli and tamari, which is the Japanese version of soy sauce, with a less salty taste and little or no gluten. For the gluten tolerant, soy sauce will suffice. Jane Baxter’s peanut sauce here serves as a dressing for a chicken and cabbage slaw.The other main branch of the salad dressing family tree is made up of opaque emulsions, thickened with cream, egg or yoghurt, some of them famous enough to have they own origin stories. Caesar salad, for example, was invented by Caesar Cardini in 1924, allegedly in response to a shortage of supplies at his restaurant. The making of a proper caesar salad is exacting and ritualistic – it’s supposed to be done by a waiter at the diners’ table – but the dressing recipe is a good one to have under your belt. Once again, Felicity Cloake’s definitive take is our guide. If you’ve got the dressing right, you can be pretty inauthentic with the rest of the salad without attracting complaint.American “ranch”-style dressing also has its own inventor: plumbing contractor Steve Henson, who first came up with it in Alaska and later served it at the California guest house, Hidden Valley Ranch, he ran with his wife in the 1950s. The dressing – a mix of mayonnaise, buttermilk, garlic and spices – proved more popular than the guest house. Technically, authentic ranch dressing is the dried packet version that made Henson rich, or the shelf-stable bottled version that subsequently became wildly popular, but the Greedy Gourmet’s recipe will give you a homemade approximation of that store-bought goodness. Henry Dimbleby’s pink peppercorn dressing is a distant, rather more glamorous relative, using single cream.Some dressings are versatile others are indelibly associated with one kind of salad. Remoulade is, in a way, both: it’s used as a sauce for all kinds of things, including meats, but with salad it’s almost always paired with celeriac. Celeriac remoulade one of my favourite things, and I only ever use this recipe, from Nigel Slater, which I keep on my phone in case I find myself in a part of the world that has celeriac but not the internet. I will not lie to you – chopping celeriac into tiny uniform sticks is boring and hard – your hand will be sore when your done. But it’s worth it.Slater’s Caerphilly salad dressing is more of a winter thing, perfect for bitter, frost-singed chicory, but it’s a rare August that doesn’t feature a few nights cold enough for a heavy salad. Thomasina Miers’ roast coronation chicken thighs may be pushing the definition of salad slightly, but the yoghurt dressing that accompanies it turns it into an ideal summer meal.Finally, we have that much-derided British staple, salad cream. Before it was a benighted, mass-produced condiment, salad cream was a respectable Victorian dressing. Simon Hopkinson uses his homemade version, made from eggs, tarragon vinegar and whipping cream, to dress a classic high-tea salad. It’s utterly incomparable, especially for me, since I’ve been careful never to try store-bought salad cream in the first place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d58ff546ddbb9a44d54d5f39ce74a83fde3806/879_1378_5316_3188/master/5316.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=560e78f1dfa1552628b6a110b13108c9","title":"arsenal plan 55 redundancies to enable us to continue to invest in the team impact covid 19 revenue","story":"Arsenal have announced plans to make 55 redundancies after encountering financial difficulties because of the coronavirus pandemic.A joint statement from the club’s managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, and their head of football, Raúl Sanllehí, argued the proposal to cut jobs was necessary as Arsenal, whose largest shareholder is the American businessman Stan Kroenke, have suffered severe drops in commercial and matchday revenue. It has been reported that the cuts will come from some football departments as well as in commercial and administrative roles, with Venkatesham and Sanllehí promising that the cost-cutting measures will allow Arsenal to keep investing in their squad. The club, who qualified for the Europa League after winning the FA Cup last weekend, are trying to convince Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to sign a new contract and hope to sign Willian on a three-year deal when his contract expires this month. Mesut Özil, their best-paid player, earns £350,000 a week.“Our main sources of income have all reduced significantly,” Venkatesem and Sanllehi said. “Revenue from broadcasters, matchday and commercial activities have all been hit severely and these impacts will continue into at least the forthcoming 2020-21 season.“We all hope there will be no ‘second wave’ but we also need to accept that is one of the many uncertainties ahead of us and plan accordingly. Over recent years we have consistently invested in additional staff to take the club forward but with the expected reduction of income in mind, it is now clear that we must reduce our costs further to ensure we are operating in a sustainable and responsible way, and to enable us to continue to invest in the team.“Our aim has been to protect the jobs and base salaries of our people for as long as we possibly can. Unfortunately, we have now come to the point where we are proposing 55 redundancies. We do not make these proposals lightly and have looked at every aspect of the club and our expenditure before reaching this point. We are now entering the required 30-day consultation period on these proposals. “We know this is upsetting and difficult for our dedicated staff and our focus is on managing this as sensitively as possible. These proposed changes are ultimately about ensuring we take this great football club forward, creating the right organisation for a post-Covid world, and ensuring we have the resources to return to competing effectively at the top of the game here and in Europe.”The club continued to pay staff in full during football’s lockdown instead of falling back on the government’s taxpayer-funded furlough scheme. The club’s 14 executives agreed to a one-third salary cut for the next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/042e7d63c46fb8adada8f96c00b4bcfc4bfe80b9/0_214_4233_2540/master/4233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a684021553090a0ef8797ac2870bfff","title":"footballers who have had club shirts retired having played very few games","story":"Plus: the longest unbeaten home runs, most draws in a promotion season and Ken Dodd’s Glasgow Empire quip“Birmingham took the unusual step of retiring Jude Bellingham’s No 22 shirt after the teenage prodigy secured a move to Borussia Dortmund. What other clubs have retired shirt numbers in honour of players? And, if there are others, are Bellingham’s 44 appearances a record low for the bestowing of this honour?” asks Derek Robertson.We covered Derek’s first question back in 2009, with Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini and Bobby Moore among the legends whose shirt numbers were retired. There have been plenty of examples of a shirt number being retired in honour of a younger player – most, sadly, in more sombre circumstances than Jude Bellingham’s.“QPR retired the No 31 shirt in memory of Ray Jones,” writes Edar Mullan. “The promising young striker had scored six goals in 37 appearances for the Rs before he died in a car crash in 2007, three days short of his 19th birthday.The list of players whose shirt number was retired posthumously is tragically long. Those who made fewer than Bellingham’s 44 appearances include Marc-Vivien Foé (Manchester City, No 23, 38 appearances), Michael Maidens (Hartlepool, No 25, 31 apps), Mark Philo (Wycombe, No 14, 17 appearances), Cheick Tioté (Beijing Enterprises, No 24, 11 appearances) and Dylan Tombides (West Ham, No 38, one appearance).Of those whose shirt number was retired while they were still alive, one man stands out: Austrian journeyman and cult figure Stefan Maierhofer. “The tall striker is not the most gifted footballer, but is rather known for his work ethic and his incredible self-esteem,” says Michael Gahler. “In November 2014 he joined SC Wiener Neustadt on a short-term deal until the end of the season. He had the option to terminate the contract if a foreign club came in for him during the January transfer window, and he joined Millwall for a second time after less than two months with Weiner Neustadt.“He had worn No 39 while at the club (it wasn’t his regular shirt number – I guess he just took some random number that was not occupied since he joined in the middle of the season), and when he left the club decided to retire his shirt number. ‘As a motivator he influenced the team with his positive energy during a difficult spell, they explained, ‘and he helped SC Wiener Neustadt to gain previously unknown public perception.’“Sadly his time at the club didn’t help them avoid relegation from the Austrian Bundesliga. They haven’t returned to the top flight since.”“Liverpool have gone three straight league seasons without a home defeat. What’s the record (English, European, worldwide)?” wonders Boris Cule.As great as Liverpool have been at Anfield in the last few years, their unbeaten run of 59 league games and three full seasons barely registers on the fortressometer. According to the wonderful RSSSF site there are at least 19 clubs who have had longer unbeaten runs at home – including Liverpool themselves, from February 1978 to January 1981. That only took in two full seasons, but the run lasted 63 matches in total.The best of the Premier League era is Chelsea, who went 86 matches and four full seasons without defeat at Stamford Bridge from March 2004 to October 2008, when they were beaten 1-0 by, yep, Liverpool. But when it comes to fortresses, nothing compares to the Bernabéu in the late 1950s and early 1960s.Real Madrid were unbeaten in 121 league games – and seven full seasons – at home between February 1957, when they lost 2-0 at home to Atlético Madrid, and March 1965. The run ended in painful circumstances for Madrid when when Jorge Mendonça (no relation) scored the only goal to give Atléti a famous victory.“West Brom drew 17 Championship games last season – is that a record for a promoted side?” asks Karin Sundmark.That’s an excellent spot, Karin, but it’s not quite a record. Our first thought was Italy in the days when backpasses were still allowed, and Serie B didn’t disappoint. In 1991-92, the last season before the introduction of the backpass law, both Brescia and Ancona were promoted after drawing 21 of their 34 league games. Ancona’s away record was particularly special: 19 games, one win, 15 draws (F-I-F-T-E-E-N), nine of them goalless. And to think some people thought the backpass law was a bad idea.Pisa did even better in 1981-82, drawing 23 of their 38 games on their way to promotion to Serie A. And spare a thought for Perugia. We all know about the 1978-79 season, when they were unbeaten in Serie A and still didn’t win the league. Six years later they lost only one of their 38 Serie B games in and still finished two points off promotion. If only they had been able to turn a couple of their TWENTY-BLOODY-SIX draws into victories.“Ken Dodd and other comedians of his era were fond of belittling their modern counterparts by saying that if they want to be compared with the old guys, they should try playing the Glasgow Empire on a wet winter Monday after Rangers and Celtic both lost at home on the Saturday,” explained in November 2003 Tom Paternoster. “Given that these two only seem to lose two games a season, has this scenario ever actually happened?”It’s highly unlikely, Tom. Because not only do Rangers and Celtic rarely lose on the same day, they also aren’t allowed to play at home on the same day – though on 19 April 1972, Ibrox was full for a Cup Winners’ Cup game against Bayern Munich just as Parkhead was for a European Cup game against Inter, which is to say that roughly 18 percent of Glasgow’s population went to the game that night.But, home or away, the Old Firm are not invincible and sometimes, they have to lose. And we’re still betting that if Ken Dodd had played the Empire on Thursday 23rd August 2001, the day after Rangers and Celtic were beaten in the European Cup by Fenerbahce and Ajax respectively, the gig would have gone down about as well as Peter Ridsdale wandering into a Leeds tavern on a Saturday night.“Leon Balogun finished his 2019-20 season with Wigan at around 9.30pm on 22 July and started his 2020-21 season with Rangers at 12.30pm on Saturday 1 August. Has there ever been a shorter gap between a player’s domestic seasons?” asks Mike Peter.“Way back when, it was common for teams to be managed ‘by committee’ rather than an inidual manager. Which was the last team in the Football League to switch to the modern system?” asks James Murton.“Ross County have five players in their first-team squad named Ross. Has any other team had more squad members sharing their team’s name,” asks Gregg Bakowski.“I ended up on the Ukrainian Premier League Wikipedia page and noticed that recurring champions Shakhtar Donetsk went top of the table way back in Gameweek 1 on the 31 July 2019 with a 3-1 win away to Oleksandriya and never dropped off the top spot all the way to the end of the season. Has this occurred in many other leagues?

But United are in such a strong position that they could pick the worst 10 players in their history, put Fred the Red in goal, and still qualify. United may yet meet Wolves in the semi-final, though a lot of water has to pass through Big Vase for that to happen.

That is a truncated summary of the instructions passed between Ray Lewington and Tyrick Mitchell during Crystal Palace’s final match of the season, a 1-1 draw with Tottenham.Mitchell is a graduate of the Palace academy and the Spurs match was his fourth senior appearance. Lewington has been coaching for 34 years. Part of his job is to pass his expertise on to players, to help them learn. Thanks to the particular conditions imposed on the restart of football, however, Lewington was able to coach in a new way live, unrelenting, in Mitchell’s ear like a podcast that was impossible to switch off.Restart football has had its critics, and the reasons are understandable. There was a sense of ghoulishness about playing on in a pandemic, something reinforced by echoes bouncing around empty stadiums. It was only being done for money and it was achieved without supporters, who were contained within a video wall, released only when it was time to shake a fist or collapse their heads into their hands.There were good bits to restart football too, though. There were things that made it different and which offered fans, well viewers, the chance to experience something new. As the 2020-21 season approaches, with a push to get things back to normal, these innovations seem likely to disappear. That will be a shame.Mitchell had a stormer against Spurs, earning a post-match backslap from José Mourinho. Watching Lewington coach him through the game and seeing the youngster absorb information and respond was fascinating. In that same game, because Palace were pumped up to put an end to a seven-match losing streak and Spurs were on the verge of qualifying for Europe, there was also a cacophony of noise provided by the players as they sought to keep each other on their toes.That intensity would normally be provided by fans, of course, and the only reason you could hear what was said on the pitch was because fans were not there. So as a trade-off it was not ideal. But sitting in the ground reporting it provided an insight I do not normally get and, by switching off the fake crowd noise, the viewer could pick it up at home, too.Other changes were deliberate, rules devised to suit the particular nature of the restart. The use of five substitutes, from a bench of nine, is one. Designed to help prevent burnout during a compacted calendar, it has been the subject of much scrutiny and some thoughtful analysis. Does it benefit big clubs with deeper resources, or actually help smaller teams for whom the gap between a first XI and its reserves is less steep?Whatever the answer, as a viewer, five subs makes for a more interesting, intriguing experience. Quite simply it offers a greater number of variations in a game. Ole Gunnar Solskjær embraced the new rule by making changes the first coach in England to introduce five substitutes and, in extra time in the FA Cup at Norwich in June, the first to make six.Against Spurs in his first game back he used four subs to change the personnel and shape into something more attacking as United tried to come back from a goal down. Once Bruno Fernandes had scored the equalising penalty, the final change was used to hoik Scott McTominay out of a makeshift backline and replace him with an actual defender.Another change was the drinks break. Brought in to help players stay hydrated during summer matches, it looks likely to be given the chop for next season. It has again been criticised, both as an unnecessary interruption and an advertising break by stealth. It is inarguably a tactical break, something which some people do not like either. But watching the FA Cup final it was hard to argue that the story of the game was not improved by Mikel Arteta using a drinks break to counter Chelsea’s blitz of a start by telling Kieran Tierney to send the ball long, beyond the opponent’s high line, wherever possible.Just for the sake of balance, Frank Lampard used the break to good effect as he switched tactics in the second half against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge in June. By holding off a City onslaught and sneaking a win (again through a more direct approach against an advancing opponent), he earned points that effectively got his team into the Champions League. Another twist.Silence, subs, drinks breaks make for a richer viewing experience. And viewing is what restart football is about. You could not go to a game as a fan but, for a glorious six-week spell, it felt as if there was always a match lurking somewhere on your phone. For the next month there will be a similar, slightly thinner experience as Uefa plays out the remainder of its competitions in what BT Sport is ill-advisedly calling Club 2020.Restart football is only available through your TV but, by and large, it was not designed for it. As all the canvas seat covers around the grounds reminded us, it was trying to get as close to normal football as the circumstances allowed. By accident it ended up showing the potential for a new kind of product that goes by the same name. “Viewers”, “products” – terminology loathed by fans trying to keep the flames of longstanding tradition alive. But on screen not in person lies the future of elite football, pandemic or not. The restart offered a glimpse of what might be possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb770acdba409cc178a5f3c98b6efc9321754664/0_617_3888_2331/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d74776a4734d29edefe62c41c4d97964","title":"how renamed streets in mumbais slums are encouraging children to study","story":"A mobile school helped Rehmuddin Shaikh become a rugby star. Now a street named after him is inspiring a new generationNo map of Mumbai mentions Rehmuddin Shaikh Road. But a local taxi driver would find the narrow lane between the huts in Ambedkar Nagar, Colaba, behind Mumbai’s elite Cuffe Parade. Despite not being officially named by the city authorities, the road boasts a new signpost.Rehmuddin Chittasahab Shaikh grew up and still lives here. Today, he is a rugby star, winning national gold and silver medals and and now coaching the Indian women’s team. He is one of the only four coaches in India to qualify for the World Rugby Level 3 coaching course.As a child, he was a student of Door Step School, a classroom on wheels for children who had no other access to education. Now the school’s co-founder is leading the project to name these narrow, winding alleys of the slum after her best and hardest-working pupils.“I felt honoured when my name was assigned to the very alley I lived in,” said Shaikh. “Normally, roads are named after famous people who are dead. This was the first time it was being named after a person who is alive.” A stranger would find it extremely difficult to locate any house in Mumbai’s slums without finding someone who lives close by to give directions. The slums are a labyrinth even for residents who face the frustrations and the challenges of living without an address, and children are particularly affected by the issue.Bina Sheth Lashkari, the social worker and co-founder of Door Step, came up with the idea to name the streets after the most promising students to encourage local children to study. To date, a dozen streets bear the silver and black signposts.“When I see Devi Chauhan Road, named after a girl from my Banjara community, I feel proud, encouraged and inspired to complete my education to become confident and independent,” said Roshani Chuvan, 11, a student.Shaikh’s mother, Saulibi Shaikh, said: “We came to Mumbai from Gulbarga, Karnataka, India, in search of work as life was tough. My son fought adversity to reach this level. I used to leave the kids when I went to work, but the teachers motivated him. I am proud about his achievements.”It was Lashkari who talked the family into sending Shaikh to school. “We had a very tough time convincing his parents. He too was reluctant to start school but once admitted he was very sincere,” said Lashkari, who believes the street names are a huge motivation for children, their family and community,Kanchan Chandrasen More was once a pupil and is now a teacher at the Door Step School. “I felt very happy and humbled when my name was assigned to an alley,” she said.Jayashree Chandrasen More, her mother, says she is delighted that her daughter is engaged in educating kids. “My daughter has made us proud and brought fame to our family.”Back in 1988, Lashkari saw how the children of construction workers, mainly migrants from Gulbarga, were not going to school but instead working as labourers.Lashkari began offering to teach after the working hours. “If children can’t go to the school, let the school come to them,” she said.This was the vision that led her and her colleague, Rajani Paranjpe to establish the first Door Step School in 1988.Initially, they found children at the railway stations and other public places and started holding outdoor classes, which became difficult in busy areas. To solve this problem, they moved to a makeshift mobile classroom – a bus for classes.School on Wheels has been educating slum children ever since and now there are seven schools across Mumbai and Pune with 800 teachers and volunteers reaching 100,000 children. Children sit on the floor using the windows, which open inwards,as desks, stationery is provided free of cost. More than 100 students are taught in each bus in groups of 20-25 for three to four hours.Rekha Shamakant Wareshi, a Mumbai teacher, joined the NGO 17 years ago. The teaching approach is practical and kids are taught through everyday examples. Emphasis is laid on improving language skills.In April, when India’s government abruptly announced a nationwide lockdown amid the pandemic, Door Step had to close like other Indian schools. A WhatsApp group was formed for parents with wifi access and those with basic phones were called, all designed to encourage children to keep up their studies at home.The founders of Door Step hope they will be back on their buses soon, said Lashkari. “It was very important to remain connected with the kids who are experiencing a lot of trauma in these uncertain times to ignite hope that someday when things are normal the school will continue.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/929ec0d3305be22574c3cd26e5c9cee0d820f84a/0_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da51e6ac4c389858dc3282db595f1406","title":"the teacher the baker and the snack box maker meet the small firms going online for the first time","story":"Since lockdown, websites have become the main source of income for many small businesses and microbusinesses. Over the next month, we’ll follow two company owners, and the mentors we’ve paired them with, as they find their feet in the digital worldDespite never selling online in the 10 years since he cofounded his artisan bakery Bread Source, Steven Winter was left with little choice when the coronavirus lockdown was announced in March. As restaurants closed, the wholesale arm of the business disappeared, and he had no idea what was going to happen to his four shops or his market stalls across Norwich and Aylsham. “At that point there was no furlough scheme. All I was trying to do was pay my 30 staff,” Winter says.The response to the new website, which launched at the start of April, blew him away. “In the first week or two, we were up to 200 orders a day,” he says. “We sold 10,000 loaves, 25,000 pastries and 10 tonnes of flour online over two months.” The team expanded their range to include other staples such as eggs, milk, butter and coffee, which were dropped off to customers across Norfolk using the bakery’s two delivery vans.Winter was also mindful of making good food available to his hospitality colleagues, many of whom had lost their jobs. He introduced a National Loaf scheme, inspired by a product conceived by the Federation of Bakers in 1942 to keep the country fed during the second world war. Today, Winter is selling the nutritious loaf for £1 and he is now hoping to expand the initiative nationwide.Sakshi Anand, senior director for GoDaddy UK, says Covid-19 has provided many small businesses with the impetus to get online, driving what’s becoming known as a second digital revolution: “One of the biggest barriers is people think it’s really complicated”, she says about launching a website. “Most microbusiness owners run finance, the technology and marketing, they’re doing everything. But once you start seeing sales coming or you see other businesses who are thriving from it, you realise it’s something you definitely need. And with GoDaddy’s drag-and-drop marketing tools, you can have a fully functioning website online in 24-48 hours.”For Winter, it’s been transformational – the online demand covered the sales the bakery would have made if it had been business as usual. He’s keen to make the business’s digital channel a permanent feature, and will be using this opportunity to develop an email marketing campaign for the 5,000 customers on the bakery’s database, experiment with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and explore widening its audience beyond the local market. He’ll be supported by Rosie Mills-Smith, Bread Source’s marketing lead, GoDaddy Guides – a 6,000-strong team providing bespoke support to small business owners – and a suite of digital tools. He and Mills-Smith are mindful of the need to scale their new retail channel in a sustainable way. “I think probably the hardest thing has been going from dealing with three or four enquiries a day on social media and via email, to literally thousands more,” says Mills-Smith.In Bath, yoga and meditation teacher Lucy Stone has been inspired to launch her new website because of the popularity of her free guided meditation videos, posted on Facebook during the pandemic. “When I started there were 10 or 15 people and then each video was getting 1,000 views. It was amazing,” she says.She’ll now work with GoDaddy’s Guides to design and launch a dedicated website for Meditation Rocks. She plans to provide guided meditation for children and adults via free videos, and to offer more in-depth courses, for which she’ll charge. She’s also open to the idea of launching a blog and adding an online shop to sell merchandise.One of the challenges she knows she’ll face in growing her brand is attracting new customers, and dealing with the image of meditation. “Yoga has come a long way in the past 15 years or so, it’s become very cool,” she says. “Meditation is still playing catch up … there’s a lot of misunderstanding about what it is and what it does.”But she won’t be alone as she makes plans for Meditation Rocks. To help Stone and, indeed, Steven Winter at Bread Source to nail their digital futures, we’ve paired each of them with a mentor who can offer expert advice.Stone will be supported by yoga and meditation teacher Nadia Narain. With a client list that has included Rachel Weisz, Kate Moss, Jools Oliver, and the Arsenal football team, Narain has been teaching yoga since 1996. She was one of Triyoga’s original teachers when the studio opened in London in 2000. She is also an author, has a range of DVDs, developed her own perfume and aromatherapy candles, and recently launched an online course promoting self care during lockdown, with her sister Katia.“I always think of yoga as my love,” says Narain. “And I’m so lucky that I get to do it.” She enjoys mentoring other teachers and says monetisation is something a lot of people ask her about.The mentor paired with Winter is Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze. He has led the healthy-snacks company for the past seven years, as it expanded into markets such as the US, Ireland and the Netherlands, and into UK retail outlets including Boots, WH Smith and Waitrose.“The wonderful thing about digital is it’s intuitive,” he adds. “So go and spend £20 on marketing. If it works well, spend £40 the next day. If nothing resonates, maybe you change things around and try something a bit different ... The obvious advantage that small businesses have is agility, and the ability to set off in a new direction. But I think we’ve crossed the Rubicon with Covid-19. People want to buy local, people want to know who’s behind the business. They’ll back you if they buy into who you are and what you’re trying to do.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

Here, three businesses share what they’ve discoveredGiven the way that we shop is changing, it has never been more important for retailers to get online. In a survey for the website builder GoDaddy, a fifth of micro businesses said they had gone online for the first time during lockdown and nearly half that their use of digital and social media tools had increased.For some, e-commerce has always been part of the plan. The artisan hot chocolate company Knoops opened its first store in Rye, East Sussex, in 2013, and went on to open a London store in February this year, with more planned. But head of marketing Anna Chapman says that having an online presence was always a key part of the company’s strategy. “Chocolate has a broad appeal, and we wanted to be able to reach people in their homes, especially those who didn’t live near our stores,” she says.\u0026nbspThe company’s website centres around its hot chocolate maker, the Knoopifier, with owners getting access to online subscriptions for pouches of “Knoopifier” chocolate buttons delivered to their home. The website has always been an important part of the company’s strategy, but Chapman says that lockdown emphasised this further.\u0026nbsp“While our doors were closed, it was obviously the only way we could take any revenue at all, and we were able to focus our efforts entirely on our website and social media channels,” she says. “This importance will remain – the majority of retailers now accept that an omnichannel approach is vital. Our current situation has been an extremely stark reminder of its importance.”For other SMEs, while a website may have been part of their business, using it to sell is a recent addition. Rob Wilson, “chief toaster” at Toast Ale, a craft beer brewer that uses bread which would otherwise be wasted, says that despite having an online presence, it wasn’t really part of the business’s strategy.\u0026nbspBut when those sales channels were cut off during lockdown, Toast Ale, which donates its profits to sustainability charities, was forced to shift its sales online. “We started to rebuild our website and have far more focus on a more functional online shop. It has massively transformed our business and helped us survive – it’s become a huge opportunity to reach a whole new audience. We just hadn’t thought about it as a sales channel and now we’ve suddenly realised its potential.”Similarly, Chris Fryer, founder of the vegan pie business Magpye, hadn’t really explored e-commerce, instead selling pies from his converted horse box at events and supplying local pubs in the north of England. “We had a full calendar of events booked. We were supplying pubs with pies and had just expanded, dropping off to four or five pubs twice a week. Then our income stopped – it was a cliff-edge.”\u0026nbspLike Wilson at Toast Ale, Fryer realised quickly that he would have to shift to e-commerce and has been similarly amazed by the effect it has had.\u0026nbsp“At the moment we’re just doing local deliveries across the north east but we’re looking into expanding. Our plan potentially is to sell our horsebox and become a web-based pie shop,” he says.When it comes to setting up an e-commerce site, there is an increasingly wide range of tools available to business owners from a range of sources. They include web hosting companies such as GoDaddy, which has created Open We Stand – a portal of resources for small businesses during lockdown. Fryer says that while he has some experience building websites, it was quicker and easier to turn to readymade tools with GoDaddy.“I had the domain registered with GoDaddy but had done nothing with it. Once it became clear we would have to move online I started looking into it. I could have gone down the route of coding it from scratch but it would have taken a week or two, especially things like payment options. With the GoDaddy tools it took half a day, then I spent a day or two testing and it was ready to go. Although we didn’t use the option, I knew GoDaddy would build the site for you for free if you needed,” he says.“They do a free three-month trial, so there’s really nothing to lose by having a go. The admin side, monitoring it, doing the orders is all quite simple, so even if you’ve got no skills whatsoever I don’t think many people would struggle with it.”At Toast Ale, the switch was led by COO Louisa Ziane, who has experience of managing websites. Wilson is adamant that the work has paid off, with e-commerce proving an “amazing opportunity”, not just now but, he believes, in the future. “I would say that at current rates we’re looking at probably half a million pounds of revenue coming from our online shop. Last year as a business we took around £1m in total, so that shows that it is very quickly becoming a significant part of our business.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

The three were cleared of murder.Lissie Harper intends to call for a change in the law in high-profile meetings with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the home secretary, Priti Patel.She said: “I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the difference that this country clearly needs. I vow to stand strong and firm with so many other honourable people in our country to make the changes that we clearly know to be justified.“I hope that by creating a new ‘Andrew’s Law’ – that sees any person who commits a crime that results in the death of an emergency worker being jailed for life – that those that have to go through what I have been through in the future get the justice that they rightly deserve.”The Thames Valley police officer became entangled in a tow rope attached to his killers’ Seat Toledo and was dragged at “breakneck” speed for more than a mile along country lanes before he was dislodged, having sustained horrific injuries.The three teenagers claimed the incident was a “freak event” that none of them could have planned or foreseen. The prosecution said the defendants must have been aware Harper, who was over 6ft and weighed 14 stone, was being dragged to his death.Lissie Harper previously condemned the murder acquittals and later wrote to Boris Johnson to ask for a retrial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7affb76762bb956b25436daf1fd3e02cdb4f4c1/0_379_5906_3546/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85dd147973c8758f9999716db637227c","title":"how the world is coping with coronavirus six months on","story":"From Portugal to Pakistan, the ’s international correspondent Michael Safi looks at the different ways countries have been affected by the virus and the impact that is having on the lives of people thereIt’s six months since Covid-19 was registered as an urgent threat, and although the panic at the scenarios that filled imaginations in those first weeks – of millions of imminent deaths, medical systems buckling and food supplies running scarce – has largely abated, the virus has not.

I hope you’ll join us.”One of the few Scottish Tory MPs to hold his seat in the Scottish National party revival in last December’s general election, Ross will work in tandem with Ruth Davidson, the former leader, who will act as his de facto deputy at Holyrood.In an unorthodox move, Davidson will return from the backbenches to face Sturgeon at first minister’s questions until the Scottish parliament is dissolved next March before the Holyrood elections in May.Davidson is stepping down as MSP for Edinburgh Central in March before joining the Lords as a life peer. In a sign of the Tories’ anxieties about Sturgeon’s soaring popularity during the coronavirus pandemic, Davidson has deferred her appointment to the Lords until then.Ross and Davidson are expected to try to reassert the centrist, one-nation Tory policies Davidson championed before she resigned suddenly in August last year, partly in protest at Boris Johnson’s election as UK leader.In a joint article for the Scottish Daily Mail on Tuesday, which made no mention of Brexit or the prime minister, the pair said their goals were defending the UK, attacking Sturgeon’s domestic record and promoting economic recovery.“For us, unionism is not an end but a means – to a fairer and more prosperous Scotland,” they said.Ross and Davidson said their alliance was based “on a genuine belief, born out of experience, that SNP rule isn’t as inevitable as some people feel. We abhor the sense of defeatism that has crept into some quarters and we want to show the fight is there for the winning.”The SNP and other opposition parties are likely to attack Ross and Davidson over their unusual parliamentary roles, and Ross’s continuing part-time job as an assistant football referee. Although he expects to win a Holyrood seat in May, Ross is currently an MP, with no direct say over devolved policymaking, and Davidson has announced she is quitting Holyrood.The SNP signalled its intention to attack Ross’s politics on Tuesday by posting a tweet accusing him of having “a long history of racist views” because he called for tougher enforcement action against Travellers in his constituency in an online interview in 2017.Accused of defamation by senior Tories, the SNP later deleted the tweet Ross had apologised for that remark and withdrawn it in a BBC interview on Monday, saying his stance then was “wrong”.Party sources believe Ross will keep the party’s Holyrood frontbench in their current posts, including his official deputy, Annie Wells, a Glasgow MSP."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f655086f3efad8d6f3cc02045de3c1f0364104f4/0_154_4140_2485/master/4140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f3b115903c9bb2af87b9b25fa013a56","title":"uk coronavirus live schools open england childrens commissioner covid 19 latest updates","story":"Nicola Sturgeon orders closure of pubs and restaurants, plus bans on non-essential travel and indoor meetingsWeekend car use has returned to pre-pandemic levels but demand for public transport remains low, official figures suggest.Stephen Joseph, a visiting professor at the University of Hertfordshire, said the figures highlight the need for “a bigger focus” on alternatives to car use for leisure travel. He said potential solutions include establishing more park and ride schemes in rural areas and creating more hubs where people can transition from cars to walking, cycling and bus services.Otherwise, the places that people come to – the seaside, national parks – will be destroyed by the traffic that’s bringing people there. Leisure car use was congesting a lot of places pre-Covid. It’s going to be even worse now when there’s less public transport available.Different coronavirus vaccines could be used on different parts of the population if laboratories succeed in developing a range of successful types, the business secretary has said.Alok Sharma visited a high-security factory in Livingston, near Edinburgh, where the French firm Valneva is developing a new vaccine using a deactivated Covid-19 virus, one of up to a dozen the UK government has said it may invest in.The UK government has ordered at least 60m doses of the Valneva vaccine, with an option to increase that to 100m doses 100m doses of another type made by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford and 30m doses of a further type from BioNTech and Pfizer, if their trials succeed.During Wednesday’s visit, Sharma said the vaccine being developed by Astra Zeneca and Oxford university was “ahead of the pack in terms of trials” but he said many of those under development could be used some may be more beneficial for different people.We’re, of course, investing in a range of vaccine candidates which have different underlying and technical properties. At the end of the day, what we hope in an ideal world, is that all the vaccines we’re investing in are successful.However, it’s also the case it will depend very much on the inidual properties of inidual vaccines, in terms of what part of the population they could be deployed into. So it is entirely possible to imagine that you have a number of successful vaccines but they’re deployed in different parts of the population.Sharma added that some caution was needed it was possible these trials may fail to get approval. The Valneva vaccine is not likely to win regulatory approval before the second half of 2021. “I hope we will be successful but there are no guarantees,” Sharma said.The latest official figures show 46,364 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider UK community after testing positive for coronavirus as of 5pm on Tuesday up by 65 from the day before.Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies show there have now been 56,600 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.The government also said that in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Wednesday, there had been a further 892 lab-confirmed cases. Overall, a total of 307,184 cases have been confirmed.Figures published by Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) on Wednesday showed the rate of positive Covid-19 tests per 100,000 people had increased to 27.6 in the week ending 1 August, from 23.5 the week before. Oldham, Manchester and Trafford currently have the highest rates of infection in the area.The authority’s 10 boroughs have been subject to reimposed lockdown measures – meaning residents are not allowed to visit different households at home, or go to indoor venues with people outside their own household – since Friday 31 July.However, data on tracing contacts of those infected shows that as of Tuesday, the national system had managed to make contact with only 6,350 of the 12,075 contacts it had identified.During a regional coronavirus briefing on Wednesday afternoon, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, called for greater access to national track-and-trace information.He argued that NHS test and trace should pass on the contact details of the people they cannot reach to the local authority within 48 hours, allowing local contact tracers to reach people on their doorsteps.Hello, this is Kevin Rawlinson back with you for the rest of the afternoon.Again, I’ll try to keep an eye on the comments below the line but the most reliable way to alert my attention to something is via Twitter: KevinJRawlinson. I look forward to hearing from you.The grieving relatives of people who have died from Covid-19 have accused the government of ignoring them, with one saying she feels their concerns are being “swept under the carpet” by ministers, MPs have heard. Grieving family members said they had written three times to the prime minister asking to meet and share their experiences. But they told the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on coronavirus that officials merely told them they were unable to meet with them “due to the current pandemic”, the PA news agency reports. Jo Goodman from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, who lost her father, Stuart, after he was diagnosed with Covid-19 aged 72, said:We wrote to the prime minister three times beginning on 11 June, asking him to meet with bereaved families and also to Matt Hancock, calling for a public inquiry and calling for them to meet with us and hear our experiences. At first we only received a two-line acknowledgement and eventually a letter saying they are unable to meet with us due to the current pandemic. The fact that they’re able to meet with cycling groups and other groups, it feels as though we are being swept under the carpet. We really do want to ensure that other people don’t go through this and we think it is really important that bereaved families’ voices are heard.Charlie Williams, another member the group, which represents 1,450 families, told MPs: I last saw my father via video. We have so many traumatic stories within our group and none of us are getting support from the government as bereaved families whatsoever. We are trying to help and support each other. We reached out to the government several times by writing letters. He has pretty much ignored us. We haven’t even received a condolence from our government. We received a two-line reply acknowledging our letter with no condolences. We find this shocking. We have got so much information to give that could save lives before the second wave and we hope the government will listen to us.The virtual meeting of the APPG also heard from people who are still struggling with symptoms from so-called “long Covid”. Dr Jake Suett, a staff grade doctor in anaesthetics and intensive care medicine, said: I was doing 12-hour shifts in ICU. It’s a high-pressure situation, you have to be able to be active. I was going to the gym three times a week regularly. And now a flight of stairs or the food shop is about what I can manage before I have to stop ... if I’m on my feet then shortness of breath comes back, chest pain comes back.Arsenal have announced they are to make 55 redundancies due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the club’s finances.In a statement issued by the club’s head of football, Raul Sanllehi, and managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, the club pointed to severe drops in broadcast revenue as the main reason for the plan.They also moved to assure supporters that investment in the team would continue, despite the job losses – with it understood the cuts will come across some football departments as well as commercial and administrative roles. This comes after players, senior football staff and the executive team took voluntary pay cuts.“Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic we have been working hard to ensure that Arsenal football club emerges in a robust and strong position for the future,” the statement read.As ministers and teachers wrestle with the challenge of safely opening schools in England in September, a former government adviser, Neil Ferguson, threw another ner in the works by suggesting older teenagers could transmit the virus just as well as adults, writes  national news reporter Haroon Siddique.A South Korean study published in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention journal last month found Covid infection rates among household contacts to be highest where they resided with someone with the virus in the 10- to 19-year-old age group. By contrast they were lowest in the age group 0-10 years. Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said of the study: It’s the best we’ve got. Children get the virus at all sorts of ages. Because people haven’t been at school, there’s no real epidemiological evidence for whether it’s a problem or not.Health officials tracing contacts in the Covid-19 outbreak in Aberdeen have released the names of 32 pubs, restaurants and golf courses scattered around the city and Aberdeenshire visited by infected people, writes Severin Carrell, the ’s Scotland editor.The list includes the Cock and Bull, a gastropub in Balmedie close to Donald Trump’s Aberdeenshire golf course and used in the past by President Trump on his visits to Scotland, as well as a golf club in Aboyne, about 30 miles from Aberdeen.NHS Grampian also named a restaurant at Bridge of Don on the outskirts of Aberdeen, the Buckie Farm Carvery, and the Dyce Carvery close to Aberdeen airport.It names two of the bars at the centre of the scare, the Hawthorn bar where the first cluster of cases emerged last week, and the Soul bar on Union Street, which featured in social media complaints about significant queues at the weekend.In a series of tweets, NHS Grampian added that its contact tracing teams had identified 191 close contacts as well as 54 infected people.Dr Emmanuel Okpo, a consultant in public health medicine for NHS Grampian, said: “I know people in the city will be concerned by this news. I want to stress that our health protection and test and protect teams are working extremely hard to speak to all the detected cases and identify their close contacts.

It is able to do really straightforward cases but the minute they get more complicated it struggles,” he said.Burnham said that in more deprived areas people were not returning calls from contact tracers because they cannot afford to self-isolate, and did not want to hand over contacts for them also to be told to miss work.He added: “The only way you can deal with these problems is a more local approach – door knocking and support for all employees to self-isolate. If anyone gets a request to isolate from test and trace, they should be able to do it immediately on full pay on the same principle as jury service.”Under the national system, call handlers aim to make contact with all infected people and those they have come into contact with, to advise them to self-isolate. If they cannot make contact after 10 calls, they are advised to move on to the next case.Tim Swift, leader of Calderdale council, said there was “two or three gaps” in the national system that it would plug with its own model, which it hopes to begin next Wednesday.He said the national call centre-based approach was fine for some areas, but was failing to understand “something as basic as getting names right” in communities where full names do not always “fit neatly into a first-name-surname function”.“We understand that and find it easier to handle,” he said. “You don’t want to just know someone is a private hire driver, but also where they work. And also you want to be able to follow up when people do not give full information and sometimes the only way to do that is to knock on a door.”Ben Leaman, consultant in public health at Calderdale, said the council would use native speakers of Urdu, Czech and Slovak to knock on the doors of people the national system had been unable to reach. All positive cases would get a text message from the council with a local number to call – a recognition of the fact many people were unwilling to call an 0300 number, often believing it to be a hoax. If they don’t reply within 24 hours they get a knock on the door.It is understood that the government is looking to ramp up its support for the worst-hit areas in England, including by assigning ring-fenced groups of contact tracers and providing them with scripts supplemented with local information.A spokesman for the Greater Manchester Combined Authority said it was in discussions with Public Health England about establishing a similar operation to Blackburn, enabling it to contact people the national system had not been able to reach “of whom there are still too many”.Cumbria launched a local test and trace system at the end of May, when its director of public health, Colin Cox, was “deeply worried” that England’s lockdown restrictions were about to be relaxed without a national system in place.Cox said its programme was “making connections between cases that the national system is not making” and he would be happy to take on all contact tracing for the region “if we had the resources”.An example of the locally-driven approach, he said, was how they dealt with an outbreak in a pub. The national system would have simply told the infected person’s contacts to self-isolate, whereas local officials would contact the pub and try to reach all of its customers and issue a targeted local appeal.A government spokesman said: “Our priority is to curb the spread of this virus and save lives, and local action to tackle outbreaks and keep people safe is a crucial part of the national NHS test and trace service.“We continue to work closely with all local authorities and are providing targeted, additional support where needed, including in Blackburn with Darwen where we have assigned a ring-fenced group of NHS contact tracers to follow up positive cases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/318dfe95b31fbb92944d775ead52162210c35d73/0_50_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85d8aab3538e10e156152959d196af73","title":"tell us how have uk childrens services been during the pandemic","story":"There have been fears around the wellbeing of vulnerable children throughout the coronavirus lockdown across the countryThere have been fears around the wellbeing of vulnerable children throughout the coronavirus lockdown in the UK, with schools, GPs and other settings where they might be referred to other services largely closed.The mental health charity Mind has said that referrals to children’s mental health services have gone down significantly during lockdown, meaning treatment providers could face a significant backlog.

The Ireland v Italy game has also been rescheduled for the previous weekend but the IRFU acknowledges it is “increasingly unlikely a capacity crowd” will be present.Currently only 200 people are permitted to attend outdoor sporting events in Ireland while plans to allow crowds back to British stadiums have been placed on hold. The French Rugby federation has also confirmed that all tickets issued for the France-Ireland game have been cancelled and will not be valid for the rescheduled fixture.Six Nations organisers, accordingly, are still not in a position to say how many fans, if any, will be in attendance, with the venue for the Wales v Scotland game also still unconfirmed as a result. “In rescheduling these matches, the health and safety of players, associated staff and supporters has been at the forefront of our thinking,” read a Six Nations statement. “We remain in close contact with all relevant authorities across the respective jurisdictions to ensure these matches take place in a safe environment and we will announce further details of health and safety protocols and guidance on spectator attendance in due course.”The Women’s Six Nations will not be completed until 5 December while this year’s Under-20 tournament has been abandoned with no winner declared, but the Six Nations’ chief executive, Ben Morel, remains determined to ensure the senior competition is played to a conclusion.“We are absolutely thrilled to make this announcement today,” said Morel. “Whilst the past few months have been extremely challenging, we have always remained hopeful of concluding this year’s tournament and we are really looking forward to the final games in the men’s and women’s championships. There is still so much to play for, and we are hugely excited for what lies ahead.“Public health remains the number one priority and while we must continue to be vigilant and cognisant of the dynamic and fast changing external environment, we are nonetheless extremely pleased to be moving in the right direction.”Encouragingly, too, the latest round of Premiership testing has produced just two positives – one player and one club staff member – out of 917 iniduals tested. With the league due to restart on Friday week, it continues the downward trend since the opening weekend of testing in early July when 10 people tested positive. Those who have tested positive and their close contacts will now isolate and be assessed in line with the PHE-agreed guidelines.Cardiff Blues’ vastly experienced No 8 Nick Williams has announced his retirement from rugby at the age of 35.

Also, a note from Matt Fordham. “I was supposed to be taking my sons (8 and 12) to this test at the weekend. Real shame we can’t go, given it’s already looking like a good test and (by then) good weather. We’ve been offered tickets for the corresponding day against India next summer.

It’s been a remarkably baby-free year (which is maybe really why we’re all geeking out on Aaron Rupar’s baby-heavy anti-Trump Twitter feed). You don’t actually realise how necessary it is till it’s gone. The only sprog I have current access to - a TurkishBelgian 2 and a half year old - has taken out a restraining order against me because he likes that velcro ball-bat game way, way less than I’d been hoping. I’d been taking evening lessons and everything.” Winnie has learned to pick up and throw one of her toys so she will like your game - hold onto it for me. I reckon she’ll be a pesky wicketkeeper. She has a British passport and her Australian one will be sorted before we go back for the Australia v Afghanistan Test then the Border-Gavaskar series later in the year. It’s still unpleasant and wet at Old Trafford. So says my man Will Macpherson, formerly of the OBO parish. I assume we’re now into the tea inverval. Sigh. “Shame about the weather today,” writes Peter Rowntree, “especially as the cricket played so far has been very interesting. Watching the international weather forecast here last night, they were talking about a gradual improvement moving to the weekend for Western Europe, with hot weather forecast for this weekend. So, let’s hope this is true, and that we generally get drier weather over the next few days.”I’m genuinely encouraged by that. Better some international forecasting than ‘local knowledge.’ As I’ve ranted at various cricket grounds, just because someone has lived somewhere for a long time does not make them a meteorologist.“Back to the subject of wicketkeepers again, I have also read reports that the Gloucestershire player, James Bracey is also very much in the selectors’ thoughts - he’s a good young cricketer and it never hurts to have plenty of competition for places.” You’re right: they like him, a lot. Consider him Generation Next. “Daddy Collins.” Rob Wilson. “A seamlessly successful puréed carrot debut? Good areas. Now you can begin to force-feed her Tolstoy in Russian, Horace in Latin and Aeschylus in Lithuanian (just for the yuks). I also recommend you find a Northern Irish babysitter to help you decipher her early oralisations (technical term). Young parents commonly fail to understand that small babies are actually speaking fairly fluent English - just in an unusually impenetrable Ballymena accent.” I didn’t tell you at the time, but we had Eurostar bookings for the week after easter, which would have given you a chance for a squeeze. But... Covid, innit. Next year.We’ve been advised to go one step further with several giant plastic sheets. I’m picturing the covers when the rain falls at a Sri Lankan cricket ground. I assume many of us watched that Sky Cricket bit on Pakistan? Athers has done a fantastic job over there. Sadly, I suspect there’s a greater chance of me walking on the moon than the Australian team scheduling a visit there this decade. “Adam.” John Starbuck. “Hi. The dropping of a wicketkeeper certainly is awkward. Think back to how Matt Prior went and the fluctuating fortunes of Jonny Bairstow. It could be that the ‘keeper considers himherself the most important part of the team and hence has a really heavy sense of responsibility, making them even more reluctant to give up. When was the last time an England ‘keeper retired willingly?” It’s interesting hearing Justin Langer discuss Tim Paine. His formulation is his captain’s main job is to wicketkeep and make things happen with the gloves that wouldn’t happen with an inferior stumper. Runs, as he sees it, are a bonus. A touch old-school, sure, but I can definitely see where he is coming from. “Hi @collinsadam.” Gary Naylor, a man I’ve missed spending press box time with this summer. “I used to mushify everything we ate in an electric coffee grinder and use it as baby food. We knew it was vegetarian and, if you froze it in those plastic containers that the Asian takeaways use for chutney, you can have a week’s worth available at all times.”Yep, that’s the plan at this end, too. She had fun sucking on a cucumber last night, devoured the carrot puree and seemed to be okay with the mushy banana we started the process with. We’re vegetarian, so we’ll follow your method.“Hi Adam.” Hello, John the Vegan Chef! “Love the OBO - keep up the great work - it can be truly weird which appeals to me greatly. I have a theory that the ECB has “Kompromat” of some kind on Ben Foakes - why else would Bairstow and Buttler be ahead of him for selection ?? - Its the only answer that makes sense.”Don’t get me wrong, Ben Foakes is a gun and the case for him to play at the moment is a robust one. However, he picked a bad time for a poor season in 2019. I noticed (well, a spy noticed for me) that Foakes was neatly gloving everything in the background of Buttler’s pre-Test interview on Sky Cricket this morning.“Hi Adam.” Marcus Steven in Seoul, one of my favourite cities, hello to you. “I stayed up as late as possible with your OBO coverage of Eng v Ire last night - one  page open on my mac, and another with Wiki’s “Glossary of Cricket Terms” up for quick reference (I’m new to this). I have to say I was really happy with your Mark E. Smith reference... it felt like someone had opened a door to me and let me in. Really looking forward to this test, the lists, and the oddities.”Yes, we had a lot of fun yesterday. It was Rob on the tools through the second stanza, though, driving Ireland to their famous win. Down my end of the press box, we weren’t exactly professional, cheering every Kevin O’Brien run. What a guy. “Afternoon Adam.” And to you, Digvijay Yadav. “On the issue of wicketkeepers, I think they are often the toughest to drop. There is an element of sentimentality about it, considering they are often the heart beat of the team (maybe a cliche). Think Healy was kept for about a season too long and even when the cull did come, it wasn’t the cleanest of executions.”Yes, that was especially ugly. For years after (even now) it became a bit of a myth that Healy was cut short just before reaching his 100th Test. In fact, he played 119! On this very topic, I direct you to Jarrod Kimber’s brilliant new podcast series on the history of cricket. He devoted the first episode to the origins of Test ‘status’. Something wholesome early in my stint? Noticing that it was raining, my partner just called me into the kitchen so that I could have my first attempt at feeding our baby some solid food - pureed carrot. She tried (and liked) it for the first time last night when I was away working on the EnglandIreland ODI. Brave new world. Guess what? I’ve arrived to an inbox full of emails about Jos Buttler after that dropped catch. “I hate to jump on the jumpiest of jumpable band wagons,” says Neil Dobson, “but can we please have Foakes in as wicketkeeper? I’m not sure how many runs that will cost us, but my guess is about a hundred million. I respect the tendency towards loyalty but I just think this is Buttleritical Correctness gone mad.”Ian Ward says that the radar they are working off shows the rain to not be quite as bad as thought for this afternoon. Of course, they can play until 7:30pm local time.It doesn’t appear to be heavy rain, but the umbrellas are up. Very dark too, according to Athers on the telly. A wonderful hour and a quarter for Pakistan. 41st over: Pakistan 119-2 (Masood 45, Babar 50) Nice flight from Bess, beating Masood’s inside edge they take the leg bye. Ohh, Babar! Stop it! He dances at Bess before clobbering him over midwicket with complete contempt, one bounce, over the rope. Glorious. Using his feet to push the next ball to cover, he takes a single to move to 50! Just 70 deliveries to reach that mark. What a dreamy cricketer he is. 00Thanks, Tanya. Lovely stuff. Hello everyone. Let’s enjoy Babar for as long as we can before the rain inevitably returns. Direct your emails or tweets my way. 38th over: Pakistan 113-2 (Babar Azam 45 Shan Masood 45) Babar looks at a short ball from Archer outside off stump and cuts it, majestically. Don’t go anywhere, this is getting good. The players pause for drinks and I hand over to my colleague Adam Collins. Thanks very much for all the company and emails - bye!37th over: Pakistan 109-2 (Babar Azam 41 Shan Masood 45) The last ball of Bess’s over spits out of the pitch and bounces just past the outside edge of Masood’s bat - NO! it skims the outside edge - where Buttler fumbles behind the stumps. Buttler adjusts his cap and looks abashed. A chance.

The smaller, cheaper Note20 starts at £849 and is available in both 4G and 5G versions. It has a 6.7in FHD+ screen running at a 60Hz refresh rate and a triple camera system with a 3x hybrid optical zoom similar to the Galaxy S20 launched at the start of the year.But it is the bigger, more expensive Note20 Ultra 5G, which starts at £1,179, that is the star for the brand’s superfans. It has a larger 6.9in WQHD+ AMOLED screen with a refresh rate up to 120Hz, matching displays from rivals such as OnePlus. The phone also has Samsung’s triple camera system with a 5x optical zoom and 50x “Space Zoom” first debuted in the Galaxy S20 Ultra.Samsung is heavily leaning on Microsoft for software tricks, which it hopes will help it against Apple and its extensive integration between iPhones, iPads and Macs. Debuting with the Note20 series will be greater integration with Windows 10, allowing full screen mirroring, the use of up to six apps at once and multi-window drag and drop between phone and PC.It will also be one of the first smartphones to support Xbox game streaming through Microsoft’s popular Game Pass Ultimate subscription, allowing users to play full Xbox games on their phone with an optional Xbox controller.Alongside the Note20, Samsung also unveiled two new S-Pen-equipped Android tablets, the £619 Galaxy Tab S7 and £799 Galaxy Tab S7+ with 11in and 12.4in screens respectively. Samsung is one of the only premium Android tablet manufacturers still standing after Google abandoned the idea in favour of Chromebooks that could run Android apps.Samsung also launched a new version of its popular true wireless earbuds. The new £179 Galaxy Buds Live feature a completely different kidney-bean shaped design that fits inside the ear and doesn’t protrude. They have an open-air design without a silicone ear tip and active noise cancellation.Samsung announced an update to its popular smartwatches too. The Galaxy Watch 3 follows on from the well-received original Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Watch Active 2. The Watch 3 resembles a traditional analogue watch, with a bigger screen and a slimmer, lighter body than its predecessors, available in 41mm and 45mm case sizes costing £399 and £419 respectively. Samsung’s favoured rotating bezel returns for controlling the watch, while blood oxygen monitoring, fall detection and enhanced running analytics help enhance its health-tracking abilities.Samsung also unveiled its third device with a folding screen. The Galaxy Z Fold 2 is a follow up to the original folding smartphone-tablet hybrid, the Galaxy Fold, and joins the flip-phone type device the Galaxy Z Flip.The Galaxy Z Fold 2 has a more refined design, a much larger 6.2in display on the front, a larger 7.6in folding display and improved cameras on the back. It uses similar display technology to the Galaxy Z Flip, which stood up well to months of real-world use.The new 5G device is expected to cost similar to the £1,900 price of its predecessor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/159804e20a5e2052ecd1e0e5d4641be21599400d/0_359_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9fa88fba633ad6516ac883940fa5f7d","title":"first time uk campers tell us about your experiences","story":"Lockdown restrictions and desire to remain within country caused so-called ‘staycation’ boom as people flock to campsitesWe would like to hear from readers who have gone – or are about to go – on a camping holiday in the UK for the first time due to travel restrictions and a desire to stay within the UK.Why are you a newbie camper?

Among her favourite guests are the Swiss man who she nicknamed “James Bond” for his flash white sports car (which looked a tad out of place in the hamlet of Specchia Gallone, especially alongside her Mini ) the interior designer from London the couple who asked her to witness their wedding and the six lesbians from Canada who she hung out with by the pool, chatting and laughing.“Those women were such great fun,” said the 61-year-old. “The most beautiful thing about this job is getting to know people.”But this year, owing to the coronavirus pandemic, there are few people to chat to.“It is a strange year, and sad to see something that was so lively now so quiet. We were like one big family,” said Gilda, whose two daughters help her manage the business when they can.“We were fully booked for the season by January: many people were returning guests, but then they cancelled their bookings because of the pandemic,” said Gilda.For Palazzo Siena, as with other hotels that have reopened, trying to stay afloat has meant reducing prices. The season began late because of the national lockdown. The pricing strategy prompted a trickle of bookings in June and July August is looking more promising. Another selling point is that Salento and the wider Puglia region have been fairly unscathed by Covid-19, with fewer than 5,000 confirmed cases since the onset of the pandemic in February.The majority of Palazzo Siena’s guests usually come from the UK, the US and Canada. This year, the foreign visitors who have made the journey so far are from neighbouring countries. Austrian Sylvia Fragapane, her Italian husband Fabio, and their daughter drove 14 hours from their home in Switzerland and booked a three-night stay at Palazzo Siena. It was the family’s first visit to Puglia.“We chose Puglia because there are few Covid cases,” Sylvia said. “And we were careful when picking a place to stay – we could tell Palazzo Siena was a beautiful home to stay in, nice and spacious and unlike normal hotels.”Palazzo Siena is somewhat of an oasis amid a pandemic. The building, once owned by a family of rich merchants, had lain abandoned since the 1960s before Gilda caught wind that it was for sale during a conversation with a fellow diner at a pizzeria in nearby Otranto, while on holiday there in 2010.“It was destroyed, but as soon as the door opened it hit me how beautiful it was,” said Gilda, who had never undertaken a project of its kind before. After a brief tussle with another keen buyer, the property was hers.It took a year to restore. Customers soon started to arrive, mostly by word of mouth. The nine airy rooms are impeccably furnished, retaining the building’s original features. Guests fall asleep to nothing but the sound of chirping crickets and wake up to the sound of church bells. Centuries-old vines cover the ancient colonnade in the vast garden, which is home to fig, walnut and almond trees. The vegetable patch provides ingredients Gilda uses in local dishes, including pumpkin flower risotto with burrata, the mozzarella-like cheese from Puglia, and courgette tart. While there’s no restaurant as such, meals can be ordered in advance and served either on the terrace or in the dining room.The pool – which is cleaned by the same person who cleans the pool at the holiday home of actress Helen Mirren in Miggiano, about a half hour’s drive away – offers respite from the afternoon heat.“This is a holiday for people who want peace and to relax,” said Gilda. “Many wake up early, to swim and do some exercise. There are lots of quiet spots to read. There are walking and bike trails nearby. People don’t have to think about dressing up or putting on makeup. For me, this is the real Salento – simplicity.”Specchia Gallone is a neat hamlet of fewer than 500 people, with little entertainment beyond a bar and restaurant. It can be reached by car from Brindisi airport, or by once-daily bus from the baroque city of Lecce, from where you can catch a train to the nearby town of Poggiardo. However, a car is essential for exploring the pristine beaches and remote villages of the Salento.The closest beach to Specchia Gallone, a 20-minute drive away, is Porto Badisco, an inlet with a small sandy beach and rocks from which local youth plunge into the clear water. As legend would have it, the Trojan hero Aeneas made a stopover in Porto Badisco after his escape from Troy.On a recent Thursday morning, the beach was packed, with little social distancing in evidence.“Fewer people are coming but it’s still impossible to find a parking space,” said resident Gino Castaldi.The beachgoers are mostly locals and other Italians on holiday.“I usually like to travel abroad, but this year I’m discovering Italy more,” said Claudio Ressa, an IT specialist from Milan, in Lombardy, the region worst-affected by coronavirus. “The situation in Milan was so heavy. But here I feel relaxed, as there are not so many cases. The people are also welcoming.”More breathing space can be found in Alimini, north of Otranto, where a long stretch of beach is backed by sand dunes and pinewoods. Most of the beach is taken up by private establishments, with lounger and umbrella rental for about €8 a day. The beach businesses must follow strict coronavirus rules, including maintaining adequate space between loungers and disinfecting the beds between customers.Salento’s economy was once fuelled by the tobacco industry, but all that remains today of that era are abandoned factories. Olive oil is a major product, but growers have been badly affected by another infectious disease – Xylella fastidiosa – a plant pathogen that has killed tens of thousands of olive trees in recent years. That leaves the region heavily dependent on tourism. Villages would usually draw visitors through cultural events and sagre, food festivals showcasing local specialities. But these have mostly been cancelledthis year.“It all went up in smoke,” said Remo De Pascalis, a bakery owner in Giuggianello, close to Specchia Gallone. “All the women usually collaborate to make traditional dishes. Sagre bring small communities together but also attract plenty of tourists – they are the event of the year.”Restaurants, especially those with ample outdoor space, are managing to hold up.“We lost April and May in the lockdown but since we reopened in early June, there has been a steady flow of people,” said Barbara Vincenti, co-owner of Matisse, a restaurant in Uggiano la Chiesa, near Specchia Gallone and recommended for its seafood. “We have a garden so we manage to distance the tables well. For the moment, we are not doing too badly. But I worry about the winter, as people might not want to eat inside. Plus, we don’t know what awaits us with the virus.”The season at Palazzo Siena wraps up in October, when Gilda returns to her home in Bari. She’s not expecting much from the next few months, but hopes to see her friends return in 2021.“This year has been different,” she said. “I just hope that nothing else happens and that we can soon get back to normal.”• Palazzo Siena has a special rate of €190 a night for its comfort rooms in August and September (normal rates in August from €223-€366). In October, comfort rooms cost €139 and suites €179, palazzosiena"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4dbef32b8d36d0ffc932a1e3b754db7707f34c0/0_48_2840_1704/master/2840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=590ff773572ff359b83c641c0599f059","title":"britons tv covid lockdown ofcom streaming netflix amazon","story":"Ofcom says 12m UK adults signed up to streaming services such as Netflix or AmazonThe typical person spent six hours and 25 minutes each day keeping informed and entertained at the height of the lockdown in April – almost a third more, about 90 minutes each day – than during the same month last year.The biggest driver of this increase in viewing was a doubling in the amount of time people spent watching subscription streaming services – such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ – to more than a hour per day, according to broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s annual study of the nation’s media habits. Among younger audiences, those aged 16 to 34, streaming screen time jumped to two hours a day.Ofcom’s Media Nation’s 2020 report estimates that 12 million UK adults signed up to a new video streaming service during lockdown. About 7 million of those already use at least one service such as Netflix and decided to bulk up their entertainment options about 2 million had previously been signed up to a service but had stopped their subscription and 3 million were new to streaming.Before lockdown, about 15m UK homes were signed up to at least one of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or Sky’s Now TV service.The lockdown provided the perfect launch conditions for Disney+, which debuted in the UK on 24 March, a day after Boris Johnson ordered the nation to stay at home.“It’s true that it has been almost perfect conditions for all the major streaming services,” said Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere. “Under lockdown there has been a lack of alternative entertainment options where you couldn’t see friends and cinemas, restaurants, pubs and clubs were closed. And with traditional TV there has been a relatively limited variety of shows, people were rapidly running out of things to watch.”Ofcom’s research shows that the UK’s public service TV broadcasters – the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Scotland’s STV – benefited from huge audience figures early during the lockdown but that boost proved to be short-lived.March provided the public service broadcasters with their highest combined monthly share of all broadcast TV viewing in more than six years. However, the popularity of broadcast TV peaked early in the pandemic, with daily viewing reaching three hours 46 minutes, the highest level since 2013, during the last week of March when Johnson announced the nationwide lockdown.With TV and film production halted due to the pandemic, broadcasters had to begin rationing dwindling stocks of staple hit shows such as Coronation Street and Eastenders while others were delayed or cancelled, such as Love Island and the European football championships, hurting viewing figures.Ofcom found that by the end of June while video streaming services held on to their uplift in viewing, including the BBC iPlayer, Channel 4’s All4 and ITV’s Hub, broadcast TV viewing had fallen by 44 minutes a day from its early pandemic peak.“The pandemic showed public service broadcasting at its best, delivering trusted news and UK content that viewers really value,” said Yih-Choung Teh, the strategy and research group director at Ofcom. “But UK broadcasters face a tough advertising market, production challenges and financial uncertainty. So they need to keep demonstrating that value in the face of intense competition from streaming services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1da7c97c08ae6c48f6b31600cec298179e32944/0_498_2390_1433/master/2390.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f95166b7a2a1dbd6429728640f8acd48","title":"joe biden democrats running mate vice president","story":"Leading VP contenders have had to endure the usual criticisms men often direct at women – which has undermined a historic selection processThe final weeks of Joe Biden’s search for a running mate have had all the usual trimmings: leaks from unnamed Democratic party officials, last-minute suggestions of outsider names and a trail of vague hints from the candidate himself.But this year is different. Biden promised to select a female running mate, setting up a historic nomination process that many prominent Democratic women say is being overshadowed by the increasingly nasty – and unmistakably sexist – debate over who he should choose.“Even in this moment of women ascending to heights that we never have in our country’s history, it’s still really being talked about and debated through the lens of a man,” said Jess Morales Rocketto, the executive director at Care in Action, a non-profit group that advocates for domestic workers.In the last week, prominent Democratic men, campaign advisers and anonymous donors have suggested that Senator Kamala Harris, a top candidate for vice-president, was too ambitious and questioned her likability.The former Connecticut senator Chris Dodd, a member of Biden’s vice-presidential vetting team, was also reportedly bothered by the lack of contrition Harris expressed over a blistering attack on Biden during an early Democratic debate – an odd point of caution for a candidate who has been in politics for decades and seen his share of heated fights. Dodd’s younger days as a partier and his history with women have also come into question during the process.Overall, this year’s vetting period has been cast with a sense of Democratic elders critiquing potential running mates for Biden with the same stereotypical criticisms men too often lob at women.Biden is reportedly now moving toward the final phase of his selection process. Jill Biden told Fox News on Tuesday that her husband was “close” to making a decision. An announcement is expected in the coming days.His selection has historic implications. Although two women have previously been nominated for vice-president, there has never been a female vice-president, and an African American woman has never been chosen as the running mate of a presidential nominee from a major US political party. If Biden wins, his pick will be poised as a frontrunner for the nomination for president in the future.Many Democratic women with extensive experience in party politics say the remarks, while not surprising, are deeply offensive and mar a vetting process that they hoped would be celebrated for its ersity.LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said she has been “appalled” by the “racist, sexist tropes” used by party leaders and elected officials to undermine female candidates for vice-president, particularly women of color.“Being a Black woman with ambition is not a problem when it’s in the service of others,” Brown said, adding: “Black women have always been on the vanguard of fighting for our democracy, and we will continue to do so. But we will also hold accountable anyone who seeks to marginalize our contributions, our intellect or our electability. This is not going to be tolerated.”The best way for Biden to show he condemns these remarks, she said, would be to put a Black woman on the ticket.The comments have also exposed a generational ide between an old guard of white, mostly male leaders and a new cohort of erse, trailblazing women who are increasingly ascendant in the party. “A new generation has arrived. It’s really interesting this cycle where there’s such an energy and new talent. And I think there’s quite a few past political folks who are trying to find their place in this new political leadership,” said Amanda Renteria, the political director of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign.Renteria added: “They’re just not constructive from a party perspective. But you ask any of those women who have been in an arena. They’re well prepared for that kind of treatment, because they’ve been experiencing it their entire life.”Throughout Biden’s search there has been familiar scrutiny of potential running mates, such as past comments the California congresswoman Karen Bass has made in praise of Scientology.Still, Bass has emphasized that she does not “envision” herself as president, which some viewed as an effort to draw a contrast with Harris. The congresswoman, however, said she refuses to be pitted against Harris or any other woman in contention for the vice-presidency.“Don’t call me the anti-Kamala,” she said during an interview with The Breakfast Club on Friday.Bass and Harris spoke privately at the memorial service for the congressman John Lewis in Washington last week. “It was good,” Bass said of their conversation. “She said: ‘We ain’t doing that.’ It was fine.”Then there are the observations and critiques that do not usually emerge when men are being vetted, and that are familiar to women in the workplace from the boardroom to the factory floor.“You’re going to get that. That’s Ed. He has not changed. So you’re going to get those kinds of comments from him,” said Susan Turnbull, a former Maryland Democratic party chairwoman and former Democratic National Committee vice-chair. “I think that women in particular are looking at this right now, going: ‘Just stop it. Don’t we have something better to be talking about?’”“Am I shocked? No,” Kathleen Sebelius, the former Kansas governor, said. “Any woman who has been in office or run before has heard similar comments along the way. They weren’t helpful then, they aren’t helpful now.”Though the jockeying has intensified in recent days, gender – and the enduring stereotypes of women and power – has shaped the process since the moment Biden eliminated half the population from contention.Early on, Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia, was chided for publicly campaigning for the role of vice-president. “I would be an excellent running mate,” she told Elle Magazine, unapologetically making the case for her candidacy.The Biden campaign has largely declined to engage in the public backbiting. But following the comments about Harris’s ambition, the campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, spoke out. “Ambitious women make history, change the world, and win,” she wrote on Twitter.“There are a number of sharp, thoughtful, and, yes, ambitious women up to the task of working alongside him every day to win this race and unite our country,” she added in a fundraising email to supporters this week.Harris, too, responded during an appearance at the Black Girls Lead 2020 conference.“There will be a resistance to your ambition,” she said. “There will be people who say to you, ‘You are out of your lane.”There is a long history of disparaging women who seek political power as “too ambitious”. But many Democratic women have found the suggestion especially galling in light of Biden’s own rise to the vice-presidency.“The point of being VP is that you’re next in line to being president,” said Katherine Grainger, a partner at Civitas Public Affairs Group, and a co-founder of the women’s advocacy organization SuperMajority. “If we just look at Biden, he ran for president in 1988 and ran again in 2008 against Obama, and yet when he was chosen as the VP nobody said he was too ambitious to have that job.”When women run for office, they disrupt a “patriarchal order” that has helped preserve a male-dominated status quo, Grainger said. Yet she is hopeful that elevating a woman to the vice-presidency could help shatter some of the old stereotypes that continue to constrain female candidates, more than 100 years after women won the right to vote in the United States.“Women are constantly walking this tightrope of being the most qualified but also likable or tough pretty and strong but also team-oriented and compassionate,” she said. “What it creates is a structure where you never really see the authenticity of female candidates, because quite frankly they’re not allowed to be themselves.”For some, it shows how many sexist barriers still exist in American politics.“All over the world, we’ve seen countries elect female leaders and yet for the United States it is still a barrier,” said Donna Brazile, a former Democratic National Committee chair. “In this country it is still a hurdle for women candidates to be taken seriously, and to be treated as equals when it comes to their qualifications, their experience, and then knowledge of the issues and the political terrain.”Brazile said the vice-presidential nomination was an opportunity to break “two glass ceilings” for women and Black women.“I’m proud of the progress we’ve made but the progress has been slow,” she said. “We need to hurry history.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f7adb02949e678faf3e290ddf5a2bc45d41e470/0_219_3279_1967/master/3279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=404a8d2ed88025daae868434fd3fd8f7","title":"global report france could lose control of covid 19 at any time","story":"Experts say Germany is already in second wave as UN warns of global education catastropheFrance’s top scientific body has said the country risks losing control of its Covid-19 outbreak and the head of the doctors’ union in Germany has said it is already facing a second wave, as the number of infections rises across Europe.The French government’s scientific council said a second wave was highly likely this autumn or winter, and that the situation was “under control, but precarious. We could at any moment tip into a scenario that is less under control.”Authorities in a number of regions have already started to tighten public hygiene rules. Mask are now mandatory outdoors in busy areas of cities including Lille, Nice and Biarritz, and the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, is expected to push for a similar order in parts of the capital this week.The virus had “recently been circulating more actively, with an increased loss of distancing and barrier measures” since France emerged from its strict two-month lockdown in May, the scientific council said, and a return of the epidemic as soon as the summer could not be ruled out.The warning came as authorities seek to contain a sharp increase in fresh cases over the past fortnight, with 3,376 new infections confirmed in the last three days and the number of people being treated for the disease in ICUs starting to inch higher.Health ministry data shows the number of people in intensive care rose by 13 between Friday and Monday, ending a downward trend maintained since April. Twenty-nine new deaths were reported over the same period, taking France’s total to 30,294.The prime minister, Jean Castex, urged France on Monday “not to let down its guard”, and called on “every French person to remain very vigilant. The fight against the virus depends on the state, local communities, institutions – but also on each of us.”After strict lockdowns stemmed infection rates, the number of cases has begun to creep up in many European countries as curbs have been steadily eased to limit the damage to their economies and allow for a much-needed summer holiday season.Germany is already contending with a second wave of the virus and risks squandering its early success because people have been flouting social-distancing rules, according to Susanne Johna, the president of Marburger Bund, which represents the country’s doctors.“We are already in a second, shallow upswing,” she told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper on Tuesday, urging people to continue to respect distancing and hygiene rules and wear masks despite an understandable desire to return to full normality.The number of confirmed cases in Germany rose by 879 to 211,281, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) reported on Tuesday, and the country’s death toll climbed by eight to 9,156. More than half of Germany’s almost 21,000 intensive care beds are free and hospitals are well prepared, Johna said.The main German teachers’ union also cautioned on Tuesday that the nation’s staggered return to school was a major risk. Schools were not prepared, it said, citing the fact that many classroom windows could not be opened for security reasons as one danger.In Denmark, where the government and parliament are due to begin discussing the fourth phase of reopening – including nightclubs – later this month, the state epidemiologist, Kare Molbak, said on Tuesday he could not recommend proceeding.“It is not something that I can recommend, from a healthcare perspective, that you go ahead with,” Molbak said, according to the media outlet Ingenioeren. The weekly number of people infected with Covid-19 in Denmark has also risen significantly in the past couple of weeks.The government is considering tighter restrictions, including the introduction of mandatory testing for all travellers returning to the country and a quarantine period for those coming from certain countries. Sittings of the upper and lower houses of parliament have been postponed by a week after a senator tested positive.Russia reported 5,159 new cases on Tuesday, pushing its total to 861,423, the fourth highest in the world. The official death toll rose by 144 in the past 24 hours to 14,351.Beyond Europe, Iran confirmed more than 2,700 new Covid-19 infections on Tuesday, its highest single-day count in more than a month as deaths and infections from the virus continued a rising trajectory since hitting a months-long low in May.The health ministry has reimposed a range of restrictions that have been lifted gradually since April and called for people who fail to wear masks – now mandatory in enclosed spaces – to be fined.Globally, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the coronavirus pandemic had led to the largest disruption of education in history, with schools closed in more than 160 countries in mid-July and more than a billion students affected.In a video message and 26-page policy briefing, Guterres said the world faced “a generational catastrophe that could waste untold human potential, undermine decades of progress, and exacerbate entrenched inequalities”.He called for schools to reopen once local transmission of the virus is under control. “The decisions that governments and partners take now will have lasting impact on hundreds of millions of young people and on the development prospects of countries for decades to come,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9b3417f38b9f078f25d55e34f8ea347159397f2/0_206_2700_1619/master/2700.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4351f17f5b0470c594bcddafd97da760","title":"ammonium nitrate what is the chemical blamed for blast in lebanese capital","story":"The deadly explosion in Beirut has been blamed on thousands of tonnes of the chemical used in fertilisers and explosivesThe likely cause of the huge blast in Beirut on Tuesday appears to have been the highly reactive chemical ammonium nitrate.Lebanon’s prime minister, Hassan Diab, said 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded after lying unsecured in a warehouse for six years, tallying with reports that a ship carrying a similar quantity of the chemical had unloaded its cargo at the port in 2013. It remains unclear what caused the chemical to ignite.Ammonium nitrate is a common industrial chemical used mainly for fertiliser because it is a good source of nitrogen for plants. It is also one of the main components in mining explosives.It is not explosive on its own, rather it is an oxidiser, drawing oxygen to a fire – and therefore making it much more intense, according to Gabriel da Silva, a senior lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Melbourne.However, da Silva said, it ignites only under the right circumstances, and these are difficult to achieve. “You need extreme circumstances to set off an explosion,” he said.While ammonium nitrate can in fact put out a fire, if the chemical itself is contaminated, for example with oil, it becomes highly explosive. “I think that’s what’s happened here,” said da Silva.While the chemicals in the air should dissipate fairly quickly, lingering pollutants can cause problems later, for example if they acidify rain.“If you look at the smoke that came from the blast it’s this kind of blood red colour. That’s because of the nitrogen oxide air pollutants in it,” he said.If the 2,700-tonne figure is accurate, that would make the ammonium nitrate explosion larger than the 1947 Texas City Disaster, when a consignment of 2,300 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded, killing nearly 500 people. The blast created a 4.5-metre (15ft) tidal wave.The images coming out of Beirut are also horribly reminiscent of the destruction inflicted on the Chinese city of Tianjin by a 2015 warehouse disaster that killed more than 170 people and left hundreds injured.On the night of 12 August a series of cataclysmic detonations rocked an area of warehouses where large quantities of hazardous chemicals, also including sodium cyanide and potassium nitrate, were being stored, in some cases illegally.Chinese authorities later claimed the first explosion had been triggered when the summer heat caused a highly flammable compound called nitrocellulose to spontaneously ignite. Nearby stores of ammonium nitrate then caught fire and exploded in the major port city, which lies 110km (70 miles) south-east of the capital Beijing.Firefighters who rushed to the scene reportedly attempted to extinguish the initial blaze with water – only to inadvertently exacerbate the situation because of the presence of hazardous flammable chemicals. The majority of those killed were firefighters, including at least one teenager.Such was the force of the Tianjin explosions that they registered as small earthquakes.Then, as now, witnesses filmed apocalyptic, almost surreal footage showing the scale of the inferno."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8064b1f7bae138fce578e78e262cf7f0a3bea20f/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3cad21b3025354727e5d3666d7d62f3","title":"ayodhya narendra modi temple foundation stone ceremony","story":"Foundation stone laid for temple to Lord Ram at site where mosque was razed 28 years ago The Indian town of Ayodhya welcomed Narendra Modi for a ceremony marking the start of construction of a temple on the site where a mosque was razed to the ground by a Hindu mob 28 years ago.Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party has campaigned for years for the temple to be built at the spot considered to be the birthplace of the Hindu deity Lord Ram. The issue has ided Indians, alienated Muslims, helped propel the BJP to power and thrown its rivals into disarray.Modi last visited Ayodhya in 1991. “When he came, he said he would only return to the city when work had begun on the temple, not before,” said Kameshwar Chaupal, a priest and member of the trust responsible for building the temple.On Wednesday, Modi offered garlands and prayers to the deity to the sound of conch shells blown by priests in saffron robes.At the temple site a 40kg silver foundation stone was placed in the ground.The temple construction is a political and religious milestone for Modi and the BJP. Following a sustained campaign, the party received the go-ahead for the temple last November from the supreme court, which said land should be found elsewhere for a new mosque.The BJP has succeeded in turning the controversial issue of whether the temple should be built into a touchstone of Hindu identity, a marker of the Hindu nationalism that forms part of its core ideology known as Hindutva.“It is an undoubted victory for Modi. He fancies himself to be a greater icon of Hindutva than the actual temple,” said Parsa Venkateshwar Rao Jr, a political analyst.Prominent Muslims have said the community was resigned to the decision but fear it could embolden Hindu nationalists to target two other mosques in the state of Uttar Pradesh.“The Modi government should assure Muslims that Hindu outfits will not ask for the construction of temples in Varanasi and Mathura after demolishing existing mosques there,” said Iqbal Ansari, the main Muslim litigant in the supreme court case, who now supports building the temple in Ayodhya.Zafaryab Jilani, the general secretary of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, a lawyer who was also involved in the legal dispute, said that while Muslims had to accept the law of the land, it was wrong of Modi to attend the ground-breaking ceremony.“It is against the letter and spirit of India’s secular constitution for the prime minister in his official capacity to attend such a religious event. It shows a woeful and total disregard for the principles of the constitution,” said Jilani.For Modi’s political opponents, the start of the temple construction has presented them with a quandary. They dare not challenge the celebrations and festivities for fear of alienating many of their fellow Hindus and appearing out of step with majority sentiment. Yet they remain nervous at the BJP’s success in conflating religious conviction with political ambition.“When politicians hail the building of the Ram temple, they choose to ignore that it is being built on the debris of mutual accommodation and represents an unprecedented homogenisation of Hinduness,” wrote Suhas Palshikar, a political scientist, in the Indian Express. “In this sense, the past one year and more has been the period of ‘no contest’ in India’s politics. If the BJP is guilty of dismantling the republic, all other parties are silent approvers.”The temple will have five domes, clusters of columns, and will reach a height of 50 metres. It is expected to be finished before the 2024 general election.

Married and cohabiting older gay men and lesbians have mainly felt the pandemic has had no more impact on them than on their heterosexual peers. But for many of the more than 200 respondents to the ’s callout, the past few months have brought significant challenges, including weeks of homophobia, biphobia and transphobia, increased isolation and deteriorating mental health.Younger LGBTQ people reported that lockdown meant being confined with families who were unsupportive or hostile. Kate, a 24-year-old bisexual demi-girl, meaning she identifies as a woman but not completely, said moving from her flat in Glasgow back into her childhood home in Ayrshire had meant hiding her sexuality again. “Being with parents who disagree with my very existence, with no one else or nowhere else to go for refuge, was tough,” said the visual merchandiser and sculptor. “I had to hide myself again. If I wanted to read a queer book I had to make sure I had something to hide the cover. I had to watch queer movies behind closed doors and hoped no one walked in and gawked at the screen.”Many trans people said relatives did not respect their identities. One trans non-binary couple, Hester and Nik, who both use the pronouns theythem, spent lockdown with Hester’s parents in Suffolk, who they said “misgendered us both consistently”. Hester added: “My mum is pretty transphobic so we avoid a lot of topics, such as JK Rowling and gender-neutral toilets. It can feel invalidating, although we get on most of the time.”For a few respondents, lockdown pushed them to demand more acceptance from their families. Huz Hussein, 31, a gay software engineer from Manchester, who lived with his family before lockdown, said being around them constantly made him feel he had “no choice but to open more about who and what I am”. He said: “Even though I am out to my mum, dad, sisters and brother, I was fed up living two lives. I am not out to my extended family and people in the local mosque community. I told my mum I felt as though I was still living a lie and I can’t be me around those people.“She said, ‘go tell anyone you want and I will stand by you and support you. You are my son and I love you.’ I know my mum still struggles with the idea of me being gay but every day she understands it more. And all she really wants is for me to be happy.”Younger people, even those who were out to their parents, commonly said that going back to living with them had adversely affected their mental health. Daniel Norman, 24, a gay man from London, said his anxiety “progressively got worse” when he moved to his parents’ house in Surrey in March. “While I am out to my parents, I struggled to be away from my friends in London where I am more openly queer than I can be at home,” he said, adding that his isolation was compounded by staying in a village with no visible LGBTQ community.“It feels like the work that queer people have put into coming out, finding community, discovering themselves has been reversed and now we have to put parts of our queer selves away when we navigate our hometowns and parents’ homes. I have only started to feel part of a community of other queer people in the past year, and was really starting to discover a lot about myself. So it was incredibly destructive to suddenly have that taken away from me.”Norman, who was seeing a specialist LGBTQ counsellor before lockdown, was one of many respondents who expressed concerns about their mental health and the loss of access to dedicated support services. Jack Cullen, from Stepney Green, in east London, who works with LGBTQ venues such as the Glory in Haggerston, said he went to check on two friends in acute distress, one of whom talked about jumping off his balcony. Cullen drew a contrast between the lives of wealthy and privileged MPs who broke lockdown and his desire to support “a drag queen disowned by her family forced to sit in a windowless room for three months, except for a few laps around an estate where kids shout abuse at her”.Most trans respondents said their distress was compounded by medical treatment being cancelled, including gender confirmation surgery. Hester’s partner, Nik, 27, a queer trans student physiotherapist, said the cancellation of their top surgery (bilateral mastectomy) was devastating “having jumped through many hoops to get referred to a surgeon”.The loss of access to LGBTQ venues, such as pubs and clubs, events, such as Pride, and community services, such as youth groups and social networks, was another widespread concern. Many respondents feared the post-pandemic recession would lead to these businesses and services closing completely, as many were already in a precarious financial state.Bronagh, a lesbian who works in media tech in London, said: “Before Covid, I made it a point to go to LGBT+ theatre, bars. Since lockdown began, just seeing fewer non-heteronormative people in daily life definitely makes you feel more like an island.”Jamie Wake, 42, a social care bid manager from Reading, helped set up a weekly event called SaturGAY to replace the one regular LGBTQ club night in the town closed by the pandemic. “It was established to combat social isolation,” he said. “It’s a quiz night with phone-ins and entertainment. Reading is similar to other provincial towns in that several LGBT venues have closed in recent years. People underestimate the value of a local LGBT community. Dedicated safe spaces are good for mental health.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89dcce825da98adc77f56607eab0a60132038626/0_8_1701_1021/master/1701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8680d9e05d3ee948dddaf4511b63973d","title":"meet david born in france raised in belgium facing removal to the drc","story":"He grew up in Brussels and dreams of a career in fashion, but hardline laws make him an asylum seeker in his own countryWhen David (not his real name) walked into the headquarters of the Belgian immigration department to apply for asylum, he looked at the other people in the queue and thought: “They don’t speak French, they had to flee their country, they have good reason for asking for protection. I’m going to be laughed at.” The officials at the reception desk did not laugh, but they did give him “a weird look”, David says. “When they heard my accent and saw my dyed blond hair, they seemed to think: ‘What are you doing here?’”David recounts that day last year with a flawless Bruxellois accent. Born on the outskirts of Paris to parents of Congolese descent, he arrived in Belgium when still a toddler. We meet close to where he lives, in Brussels’ university district. His outfit – black ripped skinny jeans, black polo shirt and two white wireless earbuds – is carefully chosen: David, now 22, is set on a career in fashion.In the same month he applied for asylum, January 2019, Belgium received 2,765 applications, mainly from Palestinians, Afghans and Syrians. Why does David, who grew up in Brussels and has never set foot outside the EU, have to seek international protection in what he feels is his home country? Because he is at serious risk of being deported to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country his parents left when they were children, following their own refugee parents.David’s mother was 17 when he was born. She soon separated from David’s father, who did not recognise David as his son. A few years later she left France for Brussels. The young, single mother entrusted her son to his paternal grandmother. “My mother wanted to live her life, my father was in jail by then,” David says. “But I had a happy childhood. I had a lot of cousins, uncles and aunts, I had my friends in school. I didn’t know anything about my immigration issues.”Estimates suggest between 100,000 and 150,000 undocumented people live in Belgium. No one seems to know how many of them are children, growing up with limited rights. “They have the right to education,” says Melanie Zonderman from the Platform for Minors in Exile, a network for migrant children’s rights, “and, like undocumented adults, the right to emergency medical services.” That is it.In Belgium, as in other European countries, the paths to legal status are confusing and difficult to navigate, let alone for a child. They can apply for a humanitarian permit to stay in Belgium under article 9bis of the Belgian aliens act, but whether this is granted or not depends on opaque criteria, which the Belgian immigration department does not make public. The process can take years, costs €358 (£325) for adults (it is free for children), and in the meantime children are at risk of deportation.David’s situation was complex. His best option seemed to be “family reunification” with a parent living legally in the country. But his mother, who suffered from mental illness and addiction, had not kept up her residence permit. His father, who was released from prison when David was about 10 years old, still had not recognised him as his son.With David’s 18th birthday approaching, his father finally agreed to a DNA paternity test. When he was 16, David received a five-year permit based on “reunification” with his father. Two years later, he was told there had been a mistake: as the child of a refugee, not a Belgian citizen, he was only eligible for a renewable one-year permit, which would become permanent after five years. David felt the blow, but told himself he just had to hold on for a few more years.Then he did something that blew it all: he came out. “When my father got out of prison, he soon realised I was not the son he would have wanted,” David said. “I have always been effeminate. He started making comments: ‘Why is he like this, why does he dance like a girl?’ And I thought: ‘I don’t even know you, and you want to change me … I don’t like this.’” During his adolescence David felt as if he had a split personality: “At school I was extrovert, sociable and good-humoured, while at home I was silent, almost embittered.”One day in January 2018, “I was fighting over the phone with my dad, and I just threw it in his face: ‘By the way, I’m gay!’ He hung up. I started packing my things.” In the following months, David felt relieved. “I started wearing makeup at school,” he says. But then October came, and he had to renew his residence permit. Among the criteria was that David’s father lived with his son and had a stable income. “When the official at the city council asked me for my father’s payslip, I realised my situation,” he says. “I told him I wasn’t even talking to my father.” David became undocumented, again.He tried applying for a permit under article 9bis, but his pro bono lawyer turned out to be not so pro bono: “He kept asking me for money.” The lack of transparent criteria also made this route risky. He went to France, his country of birth, to see if he could get papers there, but he was not eligible under French nationality laws.Until recently, a lot of families with children were rejected for asylum, says Selma Benkhelifa, a lawyer and activist from the Progress Lawyers Network. “The minors weren’t even mentioned in these decisions. They were literally treated like part of their parents’ luggage.” So lawyers started filing separate asylum requests for the children, arguing that reintegrating in countries they barely knew, after spending their childhood or adolescence in Belgium, would not only be impossible but would expose them to serious risks.On Benkhelifa’s advice, David decided to apply for asylum, based on the persecution he would face in the DRC because of his sexuality. Robin Bronlet, a colleague of Benkhelifa’s, is optimistic about David’s case. But he points out the absurdity of the rule by which children inherit the nationality of their parents. “As immigration lawyers, we must identify the risks David would be facing in case of ‘return’ to his ‘country of origin’, meaning the DRC,” he says, “even though David was born in Europe and never set foot in Africa.”Today, undocumented children are scattered all over Belgium. Some of them make the news when they suddenly disappear from school, are detained and sometimes deported. But most, like David, keep their worries to themselves and blend in with their classmates, hoping for some miraculous solution.None of David’s closest friends from school know he has lost his residence permit and has applied for asylum. “If I told them, they would worry, and it would be too stressful,” he says, “and I don’t want to be pitied.” Since leaving his grandmother’s house, David has moved around a lot. He stayed with friends and even spent a few nights in a hotel when had nowhere else to go. In September 2019, he moved into a flat with three other gay asylum seekers through Le Refuge, an organisation supporting isolated LGBTQI+ youth.At the end of 2019, David’s mother was arrested after an identity check and taken to Belgium’s only immigration detention centre for women, in Holsbeek. While he remains estranged from his father and grandmother, his mother has accepted his sexuality. She spent six months in detention before the coronavirus outbreak forced Belgian authorities to release many immigration detainees. David visited her several times. “To me, it was an extension of what I had gone through since entering the asylum system,” he says. “The human side is totally lacking. All they see in you is a sans-papiers.”David is eagerly awaiting his interview with asylum authorities. “I’m really sick of waiting. I feel stuck,” he says. And yet he is making plans for his future. He wants to start a YouTube channel offering advice on makeup, fashion, wigs and how to “boost the confidence of LGBT young people”. He wants to find a job to save money and enrol in fashion school. “Will the asylum authorities believe me?” he wonders. “I will tell them my truth. If it’s not enough, too bad. If it’s enough, so much the better.

After all, institutional racism does not exist in the politan police according to its commissioner, Cressida Dick, nor elsewhere according to some government advisers.Let us imagine that Harry Kane, say, was stopped, searched and breathalysed, with no proper cause, or questioned on the propriety of his sitting in a first-class carriage – it would be front-page news and the commentariat would be up in arms.“Why didn’t Danny report the train attendant?” I thought as I read the interview. Ah, but then, it would be his word against Danny’s, and we can guess the likely outcome.Terry WalshCartagena, Murcia , Spain• Given the ’s excellent coverage of race and the Black Lives Matter movement over the last few months, I find it surprising and pretty offensive that the Danny Rose story appeared in the sports section of your website. This is not a sports story. It is a news story. Relegating it to the sports section devalues an excellent piece and belittles an important issue.Caroline FlatleyOldham, Greater Manchester• As a widower of 87, retired editor and lay magistrate, I have great admiration for the courage and commitment of the vast majority of police officers. As the grandfather and great-grandfather of mixed-race young people, I am aware of the institutionalised racism that stalks a small minority of police.Having read with horror last week’s heart-rending Young, British and Black interviews (29 and 30 July) and your Danny Rose interview, I am not merely deeply ashamed to be white British, but I call on every police chief, politician and opinion-former to root out police officers who blight the name of those who seek to protect us. No one should be subjected to the racism recorded from teachers, the public, authority figures and the police. Words are not enough. Action – real, purposeful and meaningful – is required now. Would that those in charge had the guts to see it through.Ron JeffriesIlford, London• It is no longer enough to call on the government to review the curriculum to include more black, Asian and minority ethnic history (‘Tone-deaf’ ministers reject BAME review of English curriculum, 30 July). The astounding accounts given by the interviewees for your Young, British and Black series make it clear that anti-racism training should be a core part of the national curriculum. I find myself reviewing my 40-year career at all levels in education. I hope I was never as insensitive as some of the teachers and pupils these people encountered. None of us can be sure that, even inadvertently, we haven’t flaunted our white privilege or unwittingly offended those from BAME backgrounds with whom we came in contact. I hope ministers can reflect and realise that the time for denial is over.Linda RheadHampton, London• “It is a movement, not a moment,” says Dawn Butler (Interview, 4 August). It is both.

Poverty, war and supporting a family got in the way. Now, at 96, he has achieved his goal, becoming Italy’s oldest graduate in the process.“I’ve finally realised my dream,” the former railway worker and second world war veteran said this week, after graduating with a degree in philosophy from the University of Palermo.“Being able to study has always been my greatest aspiration, but my family wasn’t able to pay for my education. We were a large family and very poor.”Paternò, the eldest of seven siblings, started working as a child, when he helped his father with his job at a brewery in Palermo. In July 1943, when the allied forces landed in Sicily, Paternò was working as a telegrapher for the Italian army in Trapani.“I came out unscathed from the war and took a job working for the state railway service. I wasn’t enthused about my job, but I knew I had to do it because by that time I was married and had a family to support. At the same time, I had an overwhelming desire to e into books and read, study and learn.”At the age of 31, after attending evening classes, Paternò graduated from high school as a surveyor. “During the day, I’d work. In the evening I’d attend school, and at night I’d study,” he said. But his dream of earning a university degree remained elusive.Eventually, in 2017, Paternò enrolled in the department of philosophy at the University of Palermo.“I’d wake up at seven to study,” he said. “I’d use an old typewriter to complete my assignments. I’d rest in the afternoon and in the evening I’d study until midnight. My neighbours used to ask, ‘why all this trouble at your age?’ But they couldn’t understand the importance of reaching a dream, regardless of my age.”With a few exams left, the Covid-19 pandemic risked stalling his graduation. When courses transitioned to remote learning platforms, Paternò was obliged to come to terms with the new technology.“When the pandemic arrived, we started to fear for his health,” said Ninni Paternò, Giuseppe’s son. “I told my father that we could postpone exams and that he could go back to classes in the autumn. But he said no. He said that, given his advanced age, he feared he wouldn’t make it through the summer.”Paternò’s dream came to fruition last Friday, when he graduated first in his class with top honours. “It’s one of the happiest days of my entire life,” he said. “I only wish my wife were here to see me. She died 14 years ago.”Has Paternò stopped dreaming? On the contrary. “I’m considering carrying on for a master’s degree. My mother lived to be 100. If the numbers and the genetics are on my side, then I still have four years left.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e866f04bd8707a1d18bb3391f0f39c4c14bea98/0_208_3480_2089/master/3480.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9de3792c531e51e25cc810f3dd3faf1d","title":"visual guide how explosion caused mass casualties and devastation across beirut","story":"Explosion in port of Beirut has killed at least 100 people and injured 4,000 with damage extending over half the cityby  Ashley Kirk,  Chris Watson,  Paul Torpey and  Cath LevettAt least 100 people have been killed, 4,000 injured and dozens of buildings damaged after a massive explosion ripped through Beirut’s port and surrounding area.Lebanon is reeling from the extensive damage caused by the explosion on Tuesday evening, with the port area flattened and buildings further into the city’s residential neighbourhoods damaged. Efforts to treat the injured have been hampered by the fact that hospitals are among the damaged buildings.The blast was so powerful it was felt in Cyprus, 120 miles (193 km) away.Lebanon president, Michel Aoun, said 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had been stored unsafely in a warehouse for six years. After an initial blast and fire in the port, it is thought that this was the cause of a second blast, with a massive fireball and white cloud sending a shockwave across the city.Shop and apartment windows were blown out as far away as two miles (3.2 km) from the port, littering the streets with broken glass and causing hundreds of injuries.Video footage shows buildings next to the port area taking heavy damage as the shockwave spread through the city.Beirut’s governor has said that the blast damage extends to over half of the city, and that up to 300,000 people have been left homeless.Rescue teams are searching through debris in several neighbourhoods for missing people, while hospitals are overwhelmed with dealing with thousands of injured.The impact of the explosion can be gauged from aerial images showing the port before and after the blast. A chunk is missing from the quay where the explosion took place and the immediate surrounding area appears almost entirely razed.A closer view taken from a drone shows the smouldering remains of obliterated buildings, with water filling a crater where the quayside was destroyed.The destructive range of the explosion can seen in damage to an entertainment venue more than 1km across the harbour from the blast site."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ced2c704e664950358a777bd4f27113ef711479b/0_107_5368_3221/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc00cb0fb79c4668b9d54aa9f1a7545","title":"beirut explosion aftermath lebanon in pictures","story":"Lebanon is in mourning and surveying the damage to its capital, Beirut, after a massive explosion ripped through the city’s port and surrounding areas on Tuesday.

Timi, who lives in the Achrafieh district of Beirut, said she grabbed her fiancé seconds before “everything exploded around us”. “We get blasted from the couch with glass and doors flying all around us. We were in an old Lebanese house next to hospital St George in Geitawi, the house was totalled,” she said. “I really thought I was going to die.”Timi said she “huddled in the corner of the room”, which was covered with glass and blood, and began to pray. “I never pray, but I didn’t know what else to do to calm down,” she said. “My fiancé’s mother was bleeding profusely, I also had gotten a cut on my arm from the broken glass. We were in complete shock and fear,” she said. “We wandered out of the house like lost ghosts. Going nowhere and mumbling and trembling, covered in dust and blood.“It was unreal. It felt like I was in a bad dream where I was on mute and I couldn’t help anyone or myself,” Timi added. “Complete mental shock and disorientation. I didn’t take pictures because I was still under shock at the time, but at least we were overall ok (no major injuries). Some people were wounded very badly in the hospital. My heart goes out to them and their families.”Lebanese news channel, Al Manar TV, is quoting the country’s health minister as saying the toll has now risen, with tens of people still missing.More and more shocking videos of the blast and its effects are coming in. BBC Arabic journalist, Maryem Taoumi, was filming an interview when the shockwave hit.This video of a woman in Beirut playing Auld Lang Syne on the piano in her blasted-out living room is being circulated online.The government has also approved the spending of 100bn Lebanese pounds to deal with the crisis. That is worth around $13m (nearly £10m) as the unofficial exchange rate has gone into a virtual freefall.The Lebanese government has declared a two-week state of emergency, effectively giving the military full powers in the capital.The government announced the measure during a cabinet meeting, according to the Associated Press.It confirmed earlier reports that the government was putting an unspecified number of Beirut port officials under house arrest pending an investigation into how 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate came to be stored at the port for years.Here are two astonishing videos from the blast.The first captures a priest ducking from what appears to be plummeting stained glass windows.This one, meanwhile, shows a bride posing as the shockwave hits the area.Our graphics team have worked up this excellent visual guide to give you an idea of the magnitude of the blast:Another charity working in Lebanon, Islamic Relief, has warned that the country was already in a very precarious position before Tuesday’s blast.“This is yet another tragedy for a country that is already deep in crisis on multiple fronts,” said Nidal Ali, the group’s Lebanon director.He adds: “In October last year, we had to put all our long-term programmes on hold and prioritise food parcels as the economic crisis became a humanitarian emergency.“This was all before the coronavirus pandemic brought the world to a standstill earlier this year. Lebanon has seen a spike in cases over recent weeks, and hospitals are overrun.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Energy companies bid against each other for contracts of 16.5 years to provide serviceThe combination of sea-level rise, storm surges and high tides could expose an extra 23 million people to coastal flooding by 2050In throwing out State\u0026rsquos Climate Mitigation Plan, judges have done a real service to Irish democracy"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Inidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping change"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Publicans had hoped they would be able to reopen on August 10th. Photograph: Collins Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has not committed to any specific compensation package for publicans who will have to keep their pubs closed for at least another three weeks.Mr Donohoe said on Wednesday afternoon he would look at support for particular parts of the country and the economy that were affected by Covid-19 and Tuesday’s Cabinet decision, but did not refer specifically to pubs.He was speaking after the announcement of the Government’s latest exchequer figures. His comments which did not mention a specific plan or compensation for public houses will bring little comfort to vintners who have said the second delay to their reopening plans has led to a “full-blown crisis” in the industry.“My first priority is to implement the July jobs plan and that has many measures that will help,” said Mr Donohoe when asked.“I am going to be engaging with (Minister for Public Expenditure) Michael McGrath and Minister for Media, Arts and Culture, and the Gaeltacht) Catherine Martin on the consequences (of Tuesday’s Cabinet decision).He said he would be working with Mr McGrath and Ms Martin on “further measures that will be needed for some parts our our country and other parts of our economy”.He said many of measures in the July stimulus plan could have a “really positive affect on a really difficult problem”.He added: “Work is underway to what else may need to be done.” Following the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin and other senior Ministers indicated at a briefing that the Minister and others would be looking at solution to address the challenges facing pubs.Alcohol and coronavirusEarlier public health expert Dr Gabriel Scally said that alcohol is the “best friend” of the coronavirus and the only safe option was to keep those pubs not serving food closed.Dr Scally drew a clear distinction between pubs that only serve alcohol and those that also serve food.“They are like chalk and cheese. I’ve never had to shoulder my way to the counter to get a drink in a restaurant.”NPHET recommended a closing time of 10.30pm for the restaurant and cafe sector except for take-out and delivery and the mandatory wearing of masks for staff. The Government opted instead to implement a closing time of 11pm.Speaking on RTÉ Radio One’s Today with Sarah McInerney Show, Dr Scally pointed to Scotland where pubs had reopened and 32 people were infected with Covid-19 having all been in one pub.He said keeping the virus under control was not good enough, and said the aim should be to have zero cases. Keeping the pubs closed was the way to do that.A “zero Covid” strategy would require co-operation North and South, no domestic cases, and putting controls in place to ensure no cases were imported, he said.When asked about Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s proposed Four Nations Elimination Strategy, Dr Scally said he admired her and the plan but said he was pessimistic about the response from Whitehall.Dr Scally was speaking following a Cabinet decision on Tuesday evening to delay the already-paused phase four of reopening society for a further three weeks.Pubs which do not serve food and nightclubs will remain closed until September at least, and the current strict limits of 50 on numbers congregating indoors, and 200 outdoors, will remain in place.Face masks are set to become mandatory in all shops and retail centres from Monday, and pubs serving food and restaurants will be required to close at 11pm.Separately, the Cabinet also decided to remove five states or territories from the “green list” of 15 from which passengers arriving into Ireland would not need to quarantine. They are Malta, Cyprus, San Marino, Gibraltar and Monaco.Earlier, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said while he was disappointed the restrictions were not being eased the decisions were made with the safety of citizens in mind.Mr Donnelly said the Government had to take a cautious approach to lifting coronavirus restrictions and said keeping people safe, opening schools and restarting the economy was the priority.He said the Government would look closely at the possibility of having regional or county decisions in the future. The concern, the Minister told Morning Ireland, was that things were finely balanced and could get out of control.Ireland is in a dynamic situation and the Government must respond dynamically, said Mr Donnelly.Meanwhile Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae said the Government was treating publicans and their customers with contempt and he claimed reopening pubs would protect the public’s health.The dangers that might arise in bigger pubs could not be compared with smaller rural pubs where there might be just six or seven customers, he said.The decision to retrench the current phase of lockdown came after a further 45 confirmed cases was confirmed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Tuesday.Mr Martin justified the decision in light of recent coronavirus figures which have seen the 14-day incidence of cases triple in the last month.“I know that this will come as a blow to pub owners and I want them to know that I have enormous sympathy for their plight,” said Mr Martin.“This virus is taking away their ability to earn a living.”He said: “International evidence shows very clearly that pubs and nightclubs reopening too early leads directly and inextricably to increased community transmission.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said Ireland had lost some ground in its battle with coronavirus. “The truth is the pandemic is blazing around the world. In fact it is worse than ever,” he said.In a joint statement on Tuesday, the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA) and the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI) said publicans were now in “fury and despair”, and called for “immediate” aid.“This is Groundhog Day for the trade as twice now the reopening of pubs has been postponed,” said VFI chief executive Pádraig Cribben. “The Government has effectively denied pubs the ability to trade. As a result it will have to provide substantial supports to our members, many of whom are deeply agitated at what they feel is the State abandoning a vital part of the hospitality sector.”Donall O’Keeffe, chief executive of the LVA, said pubs have been abandoned: “We’re repeatedly being told that opening the pubs ‘could lead to an increase in the virus’. Well, when will that not be the case?”The 25,000 people working in pubs now faced “intolerable pressure”, said the bodies, who complained about a lack of guidance from the Government or reassurance about the future."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Findings open door to potential new osteoporosis therapiesScally says alcohol is \u0026lsquobest friend\u0026rsquo of Covid-19 and pubs must stay shutAssociation wants a clear explanation of the rationale behind the decisionDublin Airport recorded least amount of July sunshine in 34 yearsMajor new study on Irish reciism rates released by Central Statistics Office (CSO)\u0026lsquoEven in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others\u0026rsquoDPP directs pair be tried on indictment by judge and jury at circuit court level, court hearsUnsilencing Black Voices project seeks to educate people about racism in IrelandPublic health experts call for \u0026lsquoall measures\u0026rsquo to be utilised to discourage travel from overseasThose arrested in Fermanagh, Belfast and Derry are aged between 63 and 78Celebrity clothes auction aims to fill shortfall in Jack and Jill Foundation fundraisingWidower John McAreavey questions the timing of the latest probe into his wife\u0026rsquos deathTaoiseach sympathises with publicans as phase four of reopening further delayedIrish tourists helping to compensate for loss of visitors from overseas to Co Kerry townDetails on Dublin-Derry train line sought as part of recent government formation talksGAA president urges patience and says games will continue to be playedVintner groups say the 25,000 people working in pubs now under \u0026lsquointolerable pressure\u0026rsquoDrug produced more antibodies after two doses than those in recovered coronavirus patientsNobel Laureate brought from Donegal ahead of funeral in St Eugene\u0026rsquos CathedralStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4322765.1596636497!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cool dull july as co kerry recorded wettest day since 1940","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTemperatures everywhere were below long-term average for the month.

Valentia observed its wettest July since 2009.The month’s wettest day was also recorded at Valentia Observatory, Co Kerry with 54.5mm on Wednesday the 29th, its wettest July day since 1940.Temperatures everywhere were below long-term average for the month. At Ballyhaise, Co Cavan, where the average July air temperature is 13.7 degrees, the average this July was down by 1.8 degrees. This was the biggest drop in air temperatures, while the smallest drop was 0.3 degrees at Cork airport and Phoenix Park, Co Dublin.The month’s highest temperature was reported at Phoenix Park on Thursday the 16th with a temperature of 24.1 degrees, considered good for an Irish summer. The month’s lowest air minimum was recorded on Monday the 20th at Mount Dillon, Co Roscommon with 2.2 degrees, its lowest July minimum on record.All monthly sunshine totals were also below their long-term averages (LTA). The percentage of monthly sunshine values ranged from 84 per cent at Casement Aerodrome, Co Dublin to 97 per cent at Cork Airport Co Cork.The highest number of daily sunshine hours recorded in July was 14.4 hours at Johnstown Castle, Co Wexford on Sunday the 19th. The number of dull days ranged from four days at Johnstown Castle, Co Wexford to 13 days at Valentia Observatory, Co Kerry.Dublin Airport had its dullest July for 34 years with a total of 104.2 hours sunshine.Monthly average wind speeds ranged from 5.5 knots (10.2kmh) at Ballyhaise, Co Cavan to 13.6 knots (25.2kmh) at Mace Head, Co Galway.

Photograph: Andrew MilliganPA WireLongford-born journalist Peter Geoghegan was sitting in a train carriage in Newcastle just before the Brexit referendum in 2016 when a quest began to unravel a mystery about the Democratic Unionist Party’s role in winning it.Flicking through a “well-thumbed copy” of the  newspaper, Geoghegan, who works now in Glasgow and London, saw the free newspaper’s front page “wraparound” advertisement.In it, British voters were urged to “Take back control”, the slogan of the official Vote Leave campaign,” Geoghegan recalls in his new book, Democracy for Sale, which is published by Head of Zeus on Thursday.“I turned the paper over. An imprint on the back said that the advert had been ‘paid for by the Democratic Unionist Party’,” says Geoghegan, a journalist with opendemocracy.net.“This was very curious. Since its foundation in 1971, the Democratic Unionist Party had never run a single candidate outside Northern Ireland, ” he writes.It was a little epiphany that ultimately led him down a number of other tracks and has resulted in the book.It is filled with the likes Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and a former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence, Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud.Right there, too, is the DUP, which spent £435,000 “on a massive ad campaign promoting Brexit in England. I knew that election spending in the UK is tightly capped.”“I also knew, having worked as a reporter in Belfast, that political donations to Northern Irish parties were kept secret under anachronistic local laws. Perhaps this was a way around campaign limits?”So, would he solve the mystery?Geoghegan contends in Democracy for Sale that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign because Vote Leave had almost used up its permitted spending of £7 million.Vote Leave and the DUP have denied the claim.Uncommunicative groupOther organisations on both sides of the campaign were allowed additional spending of up to £700,000. The author recounts how he discovered that an uncommunicative organisation called the Constitutional Research Council (CRC) donated £435,000 to the DUP to support the Leave crusade.To prop up his Vote Leave-DUP connection conviction, Geoghegan writes, “Two months before the referendum, Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, wrote in an email to senior staff: ‘The DUP also have a £700k spending limit, which can be spent nationwide!’ ”“At that stage the DUP had yet to register as a referendum participant,” Geoghegan writes. “It only did so in late May. When the CRC started giving money to the DUP, Vote Leave had almost completely exhausted its spending allowance.”Geoghegan writes how the DUP’s Brexit “spending spree began on June 9th, exactly two weeks before the vote, when the DUP bought £100,000 worth of placards, bags, window stickers, T-shirts and badges from a small branding agency called Soopa Doopa”.This company was based in the Cambridgeshire cathedral town of Ely. The location and the company was a “surprising choice” for the DUP, thought Geoghegan. The fact that it published more than £800,000 of material for various Leave-supporting groups reinforced his belief that this was part of the alleged Vote Leave-DUP nexus.Two days before polls opened, Geoghegan writes, the CRC donated a further £334,993 to the DUP, much of which was spent on the wraparound ad in the  – a paper that does not circulate in Northern Ireland.He also says the DUP spent £32,000 on digital advertising through a Canadian company called AggregateIQ (AIQ) which had “bought millions of pounds worth of Facebook ads on behalf of a suite of pro-Brexit campaigns clustered around Vote Leave”.The Westminster “fake news” inquiry that began in 2017 and concluded in 2019 heard that AIQ had links with Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm founded by US billionaire Robert Mercer and US president Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, although this has been denied by AIQ co-founder Zack Massingham.Cambridge Analytica got in serious trouble over allegedly misappropriating digital information, including acquiring the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users.Front organisationGeoghegan, following the money trail, writes that “according to Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie, the DUP were simply a front organisation to allow Vote Leave to go beyond spending limits imposed by election laws” – again a charge that Vote Leave and the DUP strongly deny.Geoghegan explores how the only publicly known person associated with the CRC – the group that gave the £435,000 to the DUP – is Scottish businessman Richard Cook, a Conservative Party activist and Glasgow Rangers supporter.He is depicted as a colourful figure, who in 2013 jointly founded a company called Five Star Investments with Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, a former director general of the Saudi intelligence agency who died in 2015. Cook held 5 per cent of the shares, the prince 75 per cent, and a third man, Danish national Peter Haestrup, held the other 20 per cent.Haestrup was allegedly linked to an Indian gun-running case known as the Purulia Arms Drop. Haestrup told Geoghegan he was never charged, had a “100 per cent clean record” and had done nothing wrong. He also explained how the wealth management business did not get off the ground and was dissolved in 2014 after “a lot of good dinners”.Despite these intriguing connections, Geoghegan portrays Cook as a man who would not have £435,000 to easily hand over to the DUP. He is convinced the CRC money came from other sources. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told Geoghegan that Cook, his long-time political adversary in East Renfrewshire, was “a bizarrely unlikely middle-man for this sort of money”.In addition to the £435,000, the author writes about how the CRC made two further contributions to the DUP after the Brexit referendum, totalling more than £13,000 – the DUP very generally and impenetrably saying it had used the money to “further the cause of unionism at home and abroad”.Geoghegan writes that Cook refused to reveal the source of the cash and said that, although he had administered the massive DUP donation, he had never received any money from his involvement in the CRC. “I just run a small consultancy company, doing some waste energy stuff internationally,” he said.Elusive truthGeoghegan does a lot of mining to find the other CRC backers but, as he admits, the gold seam proves elusive, his work not helped by electoral law in Northern Ireland or the DUP’s refusal to answer questions.Under previous electoral legislation in the North, political donors during the Troubles did not have to disclose their names or the size of their contributions because doing so could endanger their lives.In July 2017 that changed when then northern secretary James Brokenshire decided that life had moved on and donation details could be published.It could have been the moment that changed everything. However, it was not to be. Brokenshire could have backdated that legislation to January 2014, but decided not to.This led to allegations that he had done a “side deal” with the DUP – a charge bolstered by the fact that this was at a time when the DUP had signed up to a £1.5 billion confidence and supply deal to keep then UK prime minister Theresa May’s Tory government in power.It prompted former head of the North’s Electoral Commission Seamus Magee to deduce: “The deal on party donations and loans must be part of the DUPConservative deal. No other explanation.”This was denied at the time by DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson.Geoghegan, still chasing, writes how, in mid December 2017, 17 MPs met in a Westminster committee room to consider a legal order that would bring donor transparency to Northern Ireland.During a “truncated and bad-tempered” debate, DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley, who were observers, insisted that their party had been wholly transparent about the £435,000 donation.Saying that the failure to backdate the legislation “stinks”, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw added: “The only conclusion that any reasonable person can draw is that the DUP was used, with its knowledge, by the CRC to funnel money to the Leave campaign in a way that to this day keeps the source of that money secret. By refusing to make this provision retrospective, the government are effectively complicit in covering that up.”In his book Geoghegan addresses many fascinating issues in relation to “dark money”, Brexit and political funding but in the end admits his investigation into the DUP and CRC does did not answer the big question.The wall of silence could not be penetrated. He concedes, “Just how much control the DUP had over its record donation and how it was spent remains unclear. And who was behind the money is still a mystery.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

In a letter to Government, the National Public Health Emergency Team said it had previously recommended mandatory quarantine for all passengers travelling to Ireland from overseas. “While this remains NPHET’s preferred recommendation, if this is deemed unworkable or disproportionate, the NPHET again recommends that consideration is given to the introduction of a travel ban on non-essential travel for those countries with particularly high incidence rates.” The team said 7.8 per cent of cases notified over the last fortnight are associated with travel. They recommended in their letter that “all measures be utilised to discourage travel from overseas to Ireland at this time.” The team also warned the Government that “behavioural and message fatigue” is a risk “as the population disengages from Covid-19-related news.”Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly was also warned about the increased risk of community transmission.“Ireland is no different to other countries and there remains a continuing and heightened risk that the already evident increase in cases could potentially lead to increasing levels of community transmission in the coming weeks.” NPHET recommended a closing time of 10.30pm for the restaurant and cafe sector except for take-out and delivery and the mandatory wearing of masks for staff. The Government opted instead to implement a closing time of 11pm. NPHET said that while the vast majority of restaurants and gastropubs had adhered to guidelines, there should be “continued robust inspection and enforcement arrangements and the enhancement of these arrangements where necessary.” The team said pubs and bars “pose a particular risk to the spread of Covid 19 as alcohol can make people less aware of social distancing and hygiene and respiratory behaviours, loud atmospheres can increase particles emitted and many pubs and bars can be small spaces with poor ventilation.” A paper was given to the team which detailed international evidence of outbreaks associated with pubs. NPHET said it had “significant and growing concerns” around the increasing case numbers reported each day and incidence of the disease nationally. The public health team also had concerns about the increasing number of cases in vulnerable groups, workplaces and increased levels of cases in younger people and in particular those aged between 25 to 34 years. There was also an “observed shift” in the location of the majority of cases from the greater Dublin region to other counties over the past seven to ten days. “The majority of cases are no longer predominantly limited to the greater Dublin region.” The positivity rate for all tests processed nationally in the last week was 0.7 per cent which had increased over the previous week. The NPHET said that 47 new cases and four new clusters were notified in the last week in relation to direct provision centres. There were also ten Covid 19 outbreaks involving the Irish traveller community, involving 89 cases Four outbreaks open in meat processing plants have also been associated with 94 cases. Some 49 per cent of all cases have occurred from “close contact with a confirmed case”. “The proportion of cases that are noted as being attributable to community transmission appears to be stable.” The team said it was critically important that there be low levels of community transmission in order to protect vulnerable people, open schools and resume healthcare.

Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty Images Britons have rushed for the exits of Brexit Britain, a new study suggests, sparking a brain drain on a scale last seen during the 2004 EU accession of central and eastern European countries – but in the opposite direction. The joint research report, by Berlin’s Social Science Centre and the University of Oxford’s new Berlin outpost, shows that post-Brexit immigrants in Germany are prepared to accept higher risk and even lower pay and conditions to start a new life outside the UK.Outward migration from the UK to EU neighbours has jumped 30 per cent in the last four years, to around 17,000 people annually, with about half attributable to what researchers term the “collective uncertainty” Brexit vote.That uncertainty is visible, too, in naturalisation applications. Compared with pre-Brexit figures, UK citizen applications for another EU passport have jumped 500 per cent – and 2,000 per cent for Germany.“We’re observing a new social migration phenomena and a redefining of what it means to be British-European,” said Daniel Tetlow, a co-author of the study. “In 2019, Brits came in just behind Turks in numbers receiving German citizenship – way ahead of Poles, Romanians, Iraqis or Syrians.”During the same period migration among other EU member states showed no comparable spikes and, in many cases, stagnated.As well as migration data, researchers Daniel Tetlow and Dr Daniel Auer conducted 46 qualitative, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with British migrants across Germany – a popular destination for a erse cohort of UK emigrants in the last decades.The interviews, covering arrivals from 2007 to 2019, showed a clear ide between pre- and post-Brexit arrivals. Two-thirds of the latter group were prepared to accept a pay cut, or a pay freeze as part of their UK escape plan. They were also significantly greater risk-takers than earlier arrivals: a 40-something male IT consultant said he was still hunting for work in Germany but that “the advantages still outweigh the uncertainty that Brexit brought on my family”.Brexit pushA third of the post-Brexit arrivals conceded they would not have moved had the UK voted to remain in the EU in June 2016. Within 12 weeks of that vote, half of them had departed the UK, compared to the 12 months a majority of pre-Brexit arrivals spent planning their move.“The referendum happened in 2016 – and we immediately changed our minds about buying a house in Bristol,” said one interviewee, a 40-something male academic. “Our whole emigration decision hung on the referendum result.”One-third of the recent group said Brexit had caused direct mental health problems or depression and, in what researchers called an “irony” of Brexit, new arrivals expressed a greater determination to integrate into German society, in particular by learning German, than in the past.A 30-something female translator who arrived in 2015 said, in her subjective experience, many UK citizens in Germany “do not recognise Britain any longer, and feel ashamed to call themselves British, drawing instead on regional and local identities like Scottish, Welsh, Lancastrian, from Yorkshire.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Now it is the Italians who regard the likes of the US and Brazil with anguish and sympathy.Italy has avoided the kind of second wave – or prolongation of the first wave – that has caused such concern in other countries, including Spain, France and Germany.For the past few weeks, Italy has registered around 150-300 new cases each day, many of them imported by migrants or workers returning from abroad.Deaths are down to single digits each day, a dramatic reduction from the dark days of March and April.On Monday, there were just 159 new cases and 12 deaths, while on Tuesday there were 190 new cases and five deaths. The country’s death toll is just over 35,000.Consensus is emerging as to how the Italians managed to control – the word defeat is far too premature – a virus that went onto ravage so many other countries.There were two key factors: a strict nationwide lockdown which prevented the virus from spreading from badly-affected northern regions to the rest of the country and the rigid enforcement of health protocols such as the wearing of face masks and social distancing.The lockdown, imposed in early March, averted the diffusion of the virus to the dysfunctional south of Italy, where underfunded hospitals lack the resources of those in the wealthy north.  Experts said this would have been a catastrophe. The lockdown was tough, interminable and yet largely respected. For weeks, Italians were not allowed out of their homes unless they had unavoidable work commitments, had to shop for food or buy medicine.Police cars patrolled the streets, relaying messages through megaphones ordering people to stay at home.People caught riding their bikes for pleasure rather than to get to work were heavily fined passengers on buses who did not wear masks were promptly kicked off by the drivers.Italy had one of the world’s toughest lockdowns, according to the Government Response Stringency Index, which compares the measures taken by nations around the world to combat the virus.All of this came at a heavy price – Italy’s GDP is predicted to drop by at least 10 per cent this year as a result of the closure of industry and businesses.But it seems to have worked, and a report released this week showed the extent to which the lockdown shielded the centre and south of Italy from the pandemic.The report, by the Italian health ministry and the national statistics agency, found that nearly 1.5 million Italians have come into contact with the coronavirus – six times more than the official figure.It revealed sharp regional differences – in the northern region of Lombardy, which was hardest hit by the pandemic, 7.5 per cent of the population tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.In Sicily, which was barely touched by the virus, just 0.3 per cent have antibodies, and in half a dozen other southern regions less than one per cent of residents had virus antibodies.Dr Franco Locatelli, a key government adviser on the pandemic, said the geographic variability in the results showed that the lockdown was absolutely crucial in sparing central and southern Italy from the same epidemiological wave that hit the north.The report “confirms that the establishment of red zones in the northern regions and then the national lockdown broke the chain of transmission, separating the north from the south and the islands (of Sicily and Sardinia),” said Roberto Speranza, the health minister.Since the lockdown was eased, anti-coronavirus protocols have been maintained. On buses, trains and ferries, it is compulsory to wear masks and compliance is close to 100 per cent.There has been a remarkable level of consensus over the need to keep wearing masks and they have become part of the fabric of life, with people looping them over their elbows or slipping them into a handbag when they are not needed.Office workers who have returned to work have their temperature tested on arrival and are required to wear masks in communal areas of their offices.Bottles of hand sanitiser and pedal-operated dispensers are ubiquitous and companies have cut the number of people allowed to occupy offices.As Italians flock to the coast for their holidays, even beach bars require people to wear masks as they line up for a cold Peroni or a café macchiato in their bikinis and board shorts– and the majority comply.“It’s clear that we won’t return to normal living until we have a vaccine. It will be found, but it will probably take two years before it is available to everyone,” said Giorgo Palu, a professor of virology at Padua University and a former president of the European Society for Virology.The popular stereotype of Italians being unruly, undisciplined and resistant to following rules and regulations has been turned on its head in the last five months.There may have been cultural factors at play. Italians tend to be anxious over their health – children are told not to run around and sweat too much in the summer and ordered not to swim within an hour or two of eating adults obsess over the dangers of catching a chill or worse from air-conditioning or draughts.Angst over personal health may have encouraged widespread respect of the anti-virus measures.“The trend is positive, thanks to the containment measures that were taken,” Marcello Tavio, the president of the Italian Society of Infectious Diseases, told La Repubblica newspaper.But the hard-won gains of the last few months could easily be lost if people drop their guard and start relaxing.Health experts and ministers are constantly warning that disaster lurks around the corner if Italy becomes too complacent.There is alarm over young people going out at night, crowding into piazzas to socialise, drink and flirt.“We are seeing too many gatherings, with people not taking the necessary precautions,” said Dr Tavio.The holiday island of Capri, near Naples, was so alarmed at the number of tourists congregating in its piazzas that it ordered masks to be worn outside as well as inside.The colder temperatures of the autumn and winter could lead to a dramatic spike in contagions unless health protocols are maintained, said Dr Tavio.“We have to be very careful in the autumn, when the favourable climate conditions of summer will end. The health system will need to intercept new cases at the earliest possible stage.”There is also concern over immigrant workers from Eastern European countries like Romania, and Asian countries like Bangladesh, bringing new cases into the country. A new wave of illegal migrants arriving from Tunisia and Libya is also causing alarm, with some of them found to have Covid-19.Mr Speranza, the health minister, says Italy is by no means out of danger yet.  “We cannot lower our guard. We may be out of the storm, but we are not yet in a safe harbour.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beirut explosion chemicals abandoned russian businessman triggered","story":"The timer was ticking from six years ago, when 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were taken from an impounded ship and stored in the port of Beirut. It was a massive bomb just waiting to go off a disaster equivalent to an earthquake measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale.At least 100 are dead and an astonishing 4,000 are injured in a catastrophe in one of the Middle East’s greatest cities. About 300,000 more are homeless.And all because Igor Grechushkinof, the Russian owner of the Rhosus ship, carrying the deadly cargo from Georgia to Mozambique, declared bankruptcy on an unscheduled stop, and was forced to abandon it there. It left the authorities with a fearsome problem, and one they appear to have dealt with by crossing their fingers and hoping for the best.  Not for nothing was ammonium nitrate, used in farming as a powerful fertiliser, the explosive  of choice for the IRA during the Troubles. The high-profile mainland bombings at the Baltic Exchange and Bishopsgate in the City of London in 1992 and 1993, and the blast at Canary Wharf in February 1996, bringing the first IRA ceasefire to an end, were all fuelled by it. Even the most potent of those devices contained just one five-thousandth of the ammonium nitrate which exploded in Beirut on Tuesday. It was also used by Timothy McVeigh in his two-tonne bomb that claimed 168 lives in Oklahoma City in 1995. And it is the Taliban’s preferred option too. For all that, ammonium nitrate can be safely stored. It is stable, under the right conditions. There are international protocols on how much can be held, where, and under what security precautions. It must be kept away from fuel and sources of heat, and many countries require carbon carbonate to be added, which makes it safer.Leaving it dumped in one place since 2104 and in such quantity was always likely to end badly, said Stewart Walker, associate professor in Forensic, Environmental and Analytical Chemistry at Flinders University in south Australia. Philip Ingram, an explosives expert and former military intelligence officer, said: “Ammonium nitrate can degrade over time, all the more so if it is stored badly. If it starts to degrade, it gives off heat, and that tends to self-perpetuate. Pressure builds.”All it needs then is an appropriate spark, serious enough ignition. The IRA used small amounts of Semtex. Here, according to reports, it came when a welder was making repairs to improve the security at the warehouse. It is suspected that the building contained fireworks. When the explosion ripped through the port, the firefighters trying to contain the initial blaze are believed to have been incinerated. Jeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey California, said the footage supported the firework-as-ignition theory: “Some of the videos show munitions what I call popcorning, exploding like ‘pop, pop, pop’. It’s very common to see fires detonate explosives. If you have a fire raging next to something explosive, and you don’t put it out, it blows up.” First, the video footage shows a fire with white smoke, consistent, says Professor Walker,  with ammonium nitrate burning. Then, there is a massive blast, orange and brown in colour, consistent with nitrous dioxide, given off when ammonium nitrate explodes.  And finally there is a massive white mushroom cloud, which evoked comparisons to Hiroshima, when the Americans dropped the nuclear bomb to ended World War Two in August 1945. In fact, according to Mr Ingram, it is water condensation, common in massive explosions in humid climates, created by the explosion’s massive supersonic waves.  Those waves then blasted out through Beirut, causing apocalyptic scenes of damage up to 10km away. According to reports, the blast could be heard 150 miles away in Cyprus, while the info-graphic below shows the destruction felt across the city:Mr Ingram explains: “With high-end detonations, supersonic pressure gets magnified, and the bigger the explosion, the more it gets magnified. There are two effects: blowing and sucking.“The over-pressure wave blows everything over in its way, and then there’s a big following dip in pressure. That sucks everything back in. “The bigger the over-pressure wave, the bigger the under-pressure one. Floors rise on the over-pressure wave, and fall on the under-pressure, and it explains why high rise buildings can collapse.”Mr Ingram says: “It really does depend how close. But as the over-pressure wave passes over, the inidual would feel the air being sucked from his lungs. And if very close, it is possible that his organs would explode. The effect is similar to being in a major car crash.“But that will be very, very few. Most of those who have died will have been hit by falling buildings or debris, and it is the glass and shrapnel that are responsible for such a massive toll of injuries The big shortage at the hospitals will be for blood supplies.” The nitrate came from the Rhosus cargo ship, which was carrying the explosive chemical from Georgia to Mozambique in 2013 when it made an unscheduled stop in Beirut, according to reports from the time. While commonly used as an industrial fertiliser, ammonia nitrate is also a component in mining explosives. Mozambique has significant mineral and mining industries.Mr Grechushkin declared bankruptcy and was forced to abandon the ship there after Lebanese authorities prevented it from sailing on, crew members said. Several sailors were stranded in the country for months.“Owing to the risks associated with retaining the ammonium nitrate on board the vessel, the port authorities discharged the cargo onto the port’s warehouses,” a shipping report from 2015 said.“The vessel and cargo remain to date in port awaiting auctioning andor proper disposal.”Lebanese customs officials repeatedly asked for the matter to be handled but said they had received no reply. The  attempted to contact Mr Grechushkin for comment.Lebanon has not tied the Rhosus’s cargo to the blast.Port General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV on Wedeneday the material had been put in a warehouse on a court order, adding that they knew then the material was dangerous but not to this degree.It is negligence, an official source familiar with the findings of early investigations told Reuters, adding that the issue on storing the material safely had come before several committees and judges and nothing was done to order the material be removed or disposed.Professor Walker told The : “There were a host of circumstances which should never have been allowed to happen: there was too much in one place it needs to be compartmentalised to leave it there for so long is bad practice, and, of course it was a place with a high population density. It could and should have been avoided.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beiruts explosion years making","story":"God knows the Lebanese have suffered.

I fear it is more than anyone - evenly the famously resilient Lebanese - can bear.I spent more than four years in the capital, Beirut, as a Middle East correspondent for this paper. It’s a complicated and tumultuous place where tempers and passions run high. If you don’t fall in love with it, you’ve misunderstood it. If you don’t hate it, you’ve probably done something wrong.Anyone who has ever left it - which I did in February - knows you leave a piece of your heart.Checking in yesterday on friends and old neighbours who had become more like family, there was no good news. Most live in and around the historic entertainment district of Gemmayzeh, which is so close to the port it was effectively a ground zero.One friend took shards of glass to her head and needed stitches, while one was found badly concussed by the site after he had raced down on his motorbike to report on the initial fire.My “Lebanese mother” Christina broke her arm when she was thrown by the blast’s force. Beirut’s health minister urged people to leave the city in case of any residual noxious fumes, but the 52-year-old mother-of-three - like most others - had nowhere else to go. She swept up the window fragments and put the broken frame back on her broken bed and tried to sleep.Another sobbed down the phone to me as she walked through a hole in her apartment where her front door had been. “Kil shi, kil shi (everything, everything) my whole life is gone.”  There’s little left of the places we used to frequent: gone is Anise bar where we used to drown our sorrows after a tough day reporting as is the little fruit and veg shop on the corner and the New York Times reporter’s French colonial era apartment where I had my farewell party.It is hard to overestimate the damage done to a country half the size of Wales. More than 300,000 people - a fourth of Beirut’s population - have been made homeless overnight. The anaemic state, without serious international help, is incapable of rebuilding. Many in Lebanon had predicted an explosion, though few could have imagined it would come in the form of the 2,750-tonne blast that would devastate half the city.It’s hard to pinpoint exactly where it all went wrong for Lebanon. The country - described in better times variously as the Paris of the Middle East for its glamour and the Switzerland of the region for its exemplary banking sector - had looked to be thriving in recent years.Tourist numbers were up, the beaches along its beautiful Mediterranean coastline were packed. The middle classes appeared more comfortable than they had ever been.For those who had money at least, Beirut was a pleasant enough place to live. But it belied a much more complicated reality.Lebanon had borrowed up to its eyeballs and it was only a matter of time before the bubble burst. Corruption and greed among its ruling class - warlords who had gripped onto power since the end of the civil war in 1990 - had helped bleed the country dry. The politicians didn’t even bother trying to hide it, simply blaming one another.Constant spats between the competing religious sects over who would be awarded the spoils had left them virtually incapable of governing.The problem with Lebanon, as Marwan Muasher, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, put it, is that “corruption has been democratised, it’s not sitting centrally with one man. It’s all over.”Beirutis on Tuesday began cursing their politicians before an official investigation was even underway. Experience had taught them that either incompetence or negligence would be behind the disaster, which has claimed the lives of at least 100 people and injured thousands more.Initial reports suggested that authorities had seized several thousand tonnes of highly combustible ammonium nitrate and had been storing it at the port. The blast was suspected to have been triggered by a fire started by a welder.Questions will soon be asked as to who signed off on keeping such a large quantity of a volatile and explosive substance stored in a densely populated civilian area. “What exploded today in Beirut is not just ammonium nitrate. It is above all corruption, mismanagement, incompetency and cynical disregard for the security and lives of people,” wrote one local, Dyab Abou Jahjah, who expressed the thoughts of many of his countrymen.Karl Sharro, a well-known Lebanese architect and satirist, tweeted: “Negligence, incompetence, complacency, corruption, nepotism this immoral and parasitical political class has destroyed Beirut and the whole country.”Lebanon had for months been teetering towards ruin.By the time I left Beirut in February there were daily street protests against government corruption. Saad Hariri, the prime minister (the son of a previous premier), stepped down only to be replaced by another equally loathed businessman.Then the coronavirus hit. Lebanon had the sense to shut down - fearing that its already beleaguered hospitals would not be able to cope with a major outbreak. But the lockdown sent its poorest - rendered jobless - spiralling into even deeper poverty.At the same time, the country was beginning to feel the full effect of its freefalling economy. The country’s currency lost 60 per cent in value in a matter of weeks. Last month it became the first in the Middle East in history to experience hyperinflation.Its once proud and thriving middle class have been forced to sell their possessions in online markets.There was no point looking to the government for help, it had been unable to provide the basics to its people - including water and electricity - even during the “good times”.On Monday, the country’s foreign minister resigned, warning that a lack of vision and a will to implement reforms risked turning Lebanon into a “failed state.” There is little to suggest it can do much now to avoid its wretched fate.Thousands in the Lebanese capital would have had a restless sleep in their dark, hot and windowless homes on Tuesday night. The windows may have been knocked out by the blast, but the darkness was of the country’s own making.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pub regulars abandon local quarter have not returned since lockdown","story":"Pub regulars are abandoning their locals, with one in four saying they have yet to visit since lockdown restrictions were eased.Amid fears over coronavirus, and with social distancing restrictions still in place, more than 40 per cent of pub-goers said they are visiting less often than before the virus pandemic struck in March.The survey, by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), has led to calls for Boris Johnson to cut tax on the price of a pint in order to save the industry.It comes in the first week of the Government\u0027s Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which is offering a 50 per cent discount to diners in order to kick start the restaurant industry. However, the offer does not include alcohol.The survey of nearly 4,000 CAMRA members found that, since the pubs reopened, 23 per cent are not visiting at all, 42 per cent are visiting less frequently and just three per cent are spending more time in their local.It comes amid warnings that the revenue lost during lockdown, and decreased capacity due to social distancing measures, could force tens of thousands of pubs out of business.Nik Antona, CAMRA\u0027s National Chairman, said: These figures show that there is still a long way to go to return to pre-lockdown levels of trade.The beer and pubs industry needs certainty and support in the long-term – which is exactly why cutting tax on beer served on tap in pubs would give the sector stability, support jobs and encourage people to drink responsibly in the regulated setting of the community pub.Mr Antona called for a lower rate of tax on draught beer, with the savings passed on to consumers and pubs so that pubs can compete with supermarkets and ensure jobs in the long term.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news two cruise lines discover cases covid 19","story":"Holidays have resumed in Greece since it appeared on the UK\u0026#39s \u0026#39travel corridors\u0026#39 list last monthCoronavirus latest: Pubs and shops don\u0027t need to close, says ministerHow to get travel insurance should you choose to ignore FCO advice​The best options for a last-minute holiday ​Sign up to  Travel\u0027s newsletterGreeks and holidaymakers have been told to stick to rules aimed at controlling Covid-19, as cases creep up in the country. Greece recorded 121 new cases on Tuesday, which is the highest daily tally since April 22. The surge is believed to be mainly among Greek nationals.In the early stages of the pandemic, Greece controlled the spread of Covid-19 with targeted lockdowns and nationwide social distancing measures introduced in March.Mitsotakis has described the registered rise in infections as worrying.Total cases in Greece have now reached 4,855 and there have been 209 deaths. The average number of cases per 100,000 (fortnightly average) is 7.52 – almost double what it was this time last week.“Strict adherence to the rules is demanded even more at this crucial turn, to prevent a new significant rise in cases in August and the adoption of possible new restrictive measures which will hurt the economy and society,” Mitsotakis said.The news could mean stricter social distancing and hygiene measures for holidaymakers arriving in Greece.

Moving overseas at this time should of course be treated with caution (as with all travel during the pandemic).

We are trying to awaken people with messages and daily announcements on additional measures, Government spokesman Stelios Petsas told Mega TV. The virus is here, it feeds on our complacency.Over 380 new infections have been announced in August by the national public health organisation. Only 10 per cent of cases in Greece can be traced to foreign arrivals, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told a cabinet meeting today.We have located three sources of concern: very regular crossings from Balkan countries by ethnic Greeks and residence permit holders... social gatherings, including clubbing youths, weddings and baptisms, and public transport, Petsas said.I left England more than two decades ago to live here in Australia, so I can’t speak for the mood in Britain at the moment.

She added the changes will be reviewed next Wednesday, when she hopes they could be removed, either in entirety or in part, but they could also be extended beyond that seven-day period if necessary.The Azores Islands, 1,400 km from the Portuguese coast, breached the national constitution by demanding air passengers quarantine for 14 days, the country’s Constitutional Court has ruled.The court said authorities on the islands treated people as if they were serving a short prison sentence by confining them in hotels, regardless of whether they had symptoms or not.“The competence to legislate on rights, freedom and guarantees lies with the parliament, or the (national) government - and only with those two sovereign bodies,” the court ruled.The regional government of the Azores made the decision in March that all arriving air passengers must go into a two-week quarantine on arrival. Switzerland\u0027s health authorities have added mainland Spain to its list of countries that must quarantine on arrival.Anyone travelling from Spain to Switzerland must go into self isolation for ten days, to help curb the spread of Covid-19.The measure will take effect from Saturday, and (unlike the UK\u0027s travel ban on Spain) excludes the Balearic and Canary Islands.“For the first time we did not put an entire country on the list, but rather those areas where we can say the geographical separation and above all the passenger flows — and that is decisive — can really be differentiated,” said Patrick Mathys, head of crisis management for the federal public health office.Italy has – so far – avoided the kind of second wave that has caused such concern in other countries. This has made it one of the safest bets for last-minute holiday this summer.Read our article to find out: how did they do it?While some remain reticent to travel, millions of Britons have already returned from their first post-pandemic holidays - indeed, around 600,000 of us were in Spain when the Government put the entire country on the quarantine naughty step last month.  Travel’s writers have filed postcards from France, Malta, the Greek islands, Iceland and Amsterdam in recent weeks, as well as various corners of the UK, and they reported both pros and cons when it comes to Covid-era holidays. On the plus side, beaches and attractions are often quieter, and - deprived of income for four months - tourism workers are rolling out the red carpet. On the other hand, the new rules around masks and social distancing can make relaxation difficult, while some locals - those that don’t rely on visitor spending - haven’t been so welcoming. There’s also the form-filling faff once you’re back on British soil. So what was your first post-lockdown break like? Where did you go and what did you learn? Was it worth the four-month wait or did you find it hard to get into the holiday spirit? Were the locals pleased to see you?

No airport staff or Border Force officers were wearing face masks everyone in Portugal was,” he said. “After I left the aircraft a member of staff from Heathrow asked me if I completed the form and that’s it, no one actually checked if I really did or not.“Since I arrived home no one from the Government has been in touch with me at all.”Read the full report from Hugh Morris, here.What constitutes seaside perfection, for you?Latin America has surpassed Europe to become the region with the highest number of Covid-19 deaths worldwide, according to Reuters.Brazil, the Latin American country most affected by coronavirus, recorded a total of 95,819 deaths as of Tuesday. Mexico, the second-most affected country in the region, has reported 48,869 deaths.The spread of the pandemic has also accelerated in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Peru.Last week, Latin America also became the most-affected region by number of cases – surpassing 5 million on Monday.With some scorching days ahead, and millions of Britons understandably keen for a dose of seaside fun, crowds are likely at many of the UK’s best-known beaches.

Arguably the high point of his Russophilia came in the aftermath of the Salisbury poisonings two years ago, when he declined to criticise Moscow in the face of incontrovertible evidence that the attack was carried out by Russia’s GRU intelligence service.Mr Corbyn’s natural inclination to side with one of Britain’s most committed foes was entirely in keeping with decades of anti-British activity, from supporting the IRA at the height of its terrorist campaign against the British state to his more lucrative association with Iran’s ayatollahs, where he earned around $30,000 as a contributor to Tehran’s Press TV – until the channel was banned by British regulators for its part in filming the detention and torture of an Iranian journalist.Now, as revealed by The Daily  yesterday, it transpires that, during last year’s general election campaign, Mr Corbyn made use of classified documents that had apparently been stolen from the email account of Dr Liam Fox, the former international trade secretary, by Russian hackers.The documents, which Mr Corbyn did not know had been obtained through hacking, referred to sensitive details concerning US-UK trade negotiations and were used by the Labour leader during an election rally to attack the Government for putting the NHS “up for sale”.The fact that Mr Corbyn had employed material stolen by Russian hackers to gain the advantage in a British general election was made public last month by the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, who revealed that “Russian actors” had sought to influence the election result by leaking illicitly acquired government documents.What makes Mr Corbyn’s conduct even more contemptible is that it now appears the documents were obtained after Russia hacked the private emails of a serving cabinet minister.Dr Fox himself is not entirely beyond reproach when it comes to safeguarding sensitive material, as he has something of a reputation for being accident prone in terms of breaches of sensitive information. On the eve of the 2010 general election, when Dr Fox was shadow defence secretary, he prompted a major security scare when his laptop computer was stolen from his London flat.On another occasion, as defence secretary, he was forced to call in the police after a personal letter to David Cameron warning of “draconian” defence cuts was leaked to this newspaper.The suggestion that Russian hackers were able to access Dr Fox’s account multiple times between July and October last year certainly raises some important questions as to whether measures put in place by the National Cyber Security Centre to protect government communications are effective against hostile states, such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.Moreover, there is no shortage of useful idiots operating at the highest level of British politics who have no qualms about associating with hostile states.For example, the most striking conclusion reached by the recent investigation conducted by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) into Russian meddling in British politics was Moscow’s involvement in attempts to influence the Scottish independence referendum in 2014.At the time Alex Salmond, the then SNP leader, made no secret of his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he “publicly admired” certain aspects of his involvement in Crimea, which led to Moscow’s unlawful annexation of the province.Since standing down as SNP leader, Mr Salmond has become a regular fixture on Moscow’s state-run RT propaganda channel. Moreover, Mr Salmond has resisted pressure to end his association with RT, despite the ISC report accusing the channel of putting out “serious distortions” in its coverage of British politics.Nor is the willingness of Britain’s useful idiots to champion the interests of hostile states confined to Moscow. The recent political controversy over the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has exposed an array of senior political and business figures who appear quite comfortable defending the interests of Beijing’s communist rulers.Indeed, it is entirely feasible that Britain’s sizeable pro-Beijing lobbying community would have succeeded in protecting Huawei’s stake in the country’s 5G network, with all the implications that would have had for our national security, had it not been for the intense pressure Downing Street came under from Washington to end the company’s involvement.It is crucial, therefore, that we do not underestimate the importance of useful idiots like Mr Corbyn in helping hostile states like Russia and China to achieve their nefarious objectivesMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/11/18/germany.jpg","title":"schools reopen coronavirus test trace system headteachers","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.All students are expected to return in SeptemberThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A more effective test and trace system is needed to make schools and parents feel more confident as students return in September, headteachers have told The Independent following a recent study into the programme. Simon Smith, who leads a primary school in Yorkshire, said test and trace was a “key element” in keeping schools safe. “Parents need to feel all the systems are there,” he told The Independent, ”and that if something does happen, things will happen very, very quickly in terms of the actions that schools will take”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Track and trace is a key part of that,” the headteacher at East Whitby Primary Academy said.His comments come after a study has suggested the government must scale-up its test and trace system - which tells people if they have been contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus and to isolate for two weeks – to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections as schools fully reopen. What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyOne of the authors, Chris Bonell, professor of public health sociology at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said the current testing system has “about 50 per cent coverage”.A government minister said the plan for English schools to welcome all students back next month is “not up for debate” on Tuesday following the study’s publication. Speaking about test and trace, Mr Smith from East Whitby Primary Academy said: “As a headteacher, I feel very little confidence at the moment around the fact we would be informed, or everybody is being informed that should be informed.“It may be people are wandering around with the virus without knowing.”Pepe Di’Iasio, a headteacher near Rotherham, said a scaled-up test and trace system would help his school feel better prepared for the September return. “I think we would all feel better if we had confidence in the system and obviously with four weeks to go,” Mr Di’Iasio, who is also vice president elect of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), told The Independent. “We would rather have that confidence as quickly as possible.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers from University College London and LSHTM simulated various scenarios to examine the possible implications of schools reopening in the UK coupled with broader reopening of society, such as more parents returning to the workplace and increased socialising within the community.The authors of the modelling study – published in The Lancet Child And Adolescent Health - found that “with increased levels of testing... and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.“Reopening schools fully in September, alongside reopening workplaces in society, without an effective test, trace, isolating (TTI) strategy could result in a second wave of infections between two and 2.3 times the size of the original wave,” Mr Bonell from LSHTM said.“Currently, TTI is not achieving the levels that we modelled. Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage,” he added.The NAHT, a school leaders’ union, said the new research showed “just how many factors there are to preventing a worsening Covid-19 outbreak, most of which are entirely outside a school’s control”.Efficient test-trace-isolate system needed to reopen schools- studyMinisters still planning to open all English schools in SeptemberMPs criticise school meal voucher scheme for covering M\u0026ampS but not LidlPaul Whiteman, the general secretary, said: “The success of September’s return to school rests as much on what happens outside the school gates as within.”He added: “The government needs to ensure that everyone knows what actions they should be taking to keep everyone safe – we’re all going to need to work together to be successful.”Meanwhile, Richard Bettsworth from ASCL said: “It is very clear that an effective test, trace, and isolate strategy is vital in suppressing the rate of infection, and keeping schools open.” The director of public affairs added: “The government has to make sure that this works at the scale that is necessary.”Schools are expected to fully reopen to all students in September.  A government spokesperson said: “We have rapidly built, from scratch, the largest diagnostic testing industry in British history. Over 16 million tests have been delivered so far and we have the capacity to carry out more than 330,000 tests per day, growing to 500,000 per day by the end of October.“Plans have been put in place to ensure schools can re-open safely. Local health officials, using the latest data, will able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases.They added: “The NHS Test and Trace service has now and contacted more than 218,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, or recently been in contact with someone who has tested positive – in order to break the chain of transmission.”Additional reporting by Press Associationtest and trace\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Ammonium nitrate appears to be the cause of the huge explosion that has left large parts of Beirut ruined and at least 100 people dead.Some 2,750 tonnes of the material had been stored in a warehouse for six years without proper security measures, according to Lebanese president Michel Aoun.The scale of the blast – which could be felt as far away as Cyprus – appears similar to other incidents where ammonium nitrate has exploded, experts have said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the chemical, which is used as an agricultural fertiliser, is unable to explode on its own. While it is a powerful fuel for explosions, because it includes both the fuel and oxygen required for a fire – and has been used as such in terror attacks – it still needs to be ignited by heat, since it cannot detonate on its own.Early videos suggest the fireworks could have played that role. Videos show a small initial fire, accompanied by the small sparks and pops of fireworks going off, before the large explosion happens and engulfs the city around it.Search for survivors as Beirut wakes up to huge devastation - updatesThat larger blast had all the hallmarks of being caused by ammonium nitrate. After it had cleared, orange clouds could be seen, which are probably toxic nitrogen dioxide gas that is released by explosions that involve nitrates.The white cloud that came alongside the massive blast and quickly spread through the city appears to be a condensation cloud. Those typically accompany massive explosions in humid conditions, following the shock waves, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California.The repeated betrayal of Beirut\u0027s suffering citizens is a travestyAerial footage of Beirut explosion reveals extent of devastationFormer aide slams Trump for \u0027spitballing\u0027 cause of Beirut blastsAmmonium nitrate is typically used for agricultural fertiliser. It is a relatively simple and inexpensive way of providing plants with nitrates.It is naturally occurring, and comes in the form of a white solid that dissolves in water that is also known as saltpetre. It is mostly made synthetically, in industrial production that allows it to be produced relatively cheaply for agricultural use.Another legitimate use is in controlled explosions, such as those during mining and civil construction work.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut ammonium nitrate is not explosive in itself, and still needs something specific to ignite it. In its pure state, it is actually relatively hard to ignite, though if it is mixed with something like oil it becomes much more dangerous.Once it is detonated, however, it produces oxygen, meaning that it can very quickly increase the scale of an existing fire. As such, in many of the intentional and accidental disasters it has caused, it has acted to escalate explosions rather than as the first cause of them.The particular way that the explosion happened will change the number and types of casualties that will be expected, said David Caldicott, an emergency consultant and senior clinical lecturer in medicine at the Australian National University.This explosion can be considered as a ‘high order’ explosion, with an obvious blast wave seen to be propagated from a massive secondary explosion, that followed on from the event, he said.Primary injuries are blast-related, as a consequence of the overpressure wave interacting with the hollow space in victims lung injuries are often survived, but subsequently fatal, and bowel injuries are common.Secondary injuries are caused by flying debris effectively environmental shrapnel.Tertiary injuries are as a consequence of being thrown by the blast, and quaternary injuries by other features such as inhalation.Many famous bombing incidents – including those carried by the IRA in London through the 90s – made use of the explosive powers of fertiliser.As a result, the chemical is tightly regulated in many countries. Though it cannot be banned as a result of its use in agriculture, both the purchase and storage of ammonium nitrate is governed by tightly-defined health and safety legislation.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Germans believed that Royal Navy ers had entered the vessel and had recovered crucial intelligence information, including a detailed map of German minefields.However, the University of Southampton investigation, led by archaeologist Dr Rodrigo Pacheco-Ruiz, has now assessed the wreck\u0027s approximate depth in November 1917 (48-51 metres) – which suggests that er penetration of the vessel was extremely unlikely.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The only way to recover intelligence information was therefore to repeatedly depth charge her in the hope that additional holes in the vessel could be created – and that, as a result, important documents might then float to the surface.Although there are no surviving British records of any such intelligence-gathering coup, senior German naval officials did know about it (although they wrongly assumed that the crucial papers had been recovered by Royal Navy ers – rather than as floating debris).But how did they know? German historians, working in collaboration with the University of Southampton, are now planning to search the German archives to try to find an answer.It is conceivable that the German Navy had obtained the information by listening to Royal Navy wartime radio communications – or they may have somehow obtained it from British naval sources after the war.During the First World War, it was notoriously difficult to sink German U-boats. However, in late 1917 and 1918, the Royal Navy developed a number of techniques to reduce the impact of German submarines and to increase the number being sunk.To reduce the German U-boat kill rates, they introduced the convoy system for UK merchant vessels – and to increase British success in destroying German U-boats, they fitted strengthened bows to Royal Navy anti-submarine vessels (to enable them to ram U-boats) and they developed the first effective depth charges.Both new technologies were employed in the sinking of UC47.And the repeated depth charge attacks on the sunken German submarine seems to have enabled the British to gain crucial intelligence information that would in turn have enabled them to locate and clear the mines that UC47, had laid (thus saving many UK merchant vessels from destruction).The Germans primarily used their U-boats to damage the UK\u0027s war effort – by seeking to blockade Britain and by trying to prevent the UK transporting vital coal, steel, timber and cement (much of which had to be transported from northern Britain to southern Britain by coastal cargo vessels).It was in the second half of 1917 that the Royal Navy began to defeat the U-boat threat – and the sinking of UC 47 was an important part of that process – particularly so because that particular submarine was one of the most effective in the German Navy. Prior to its sinking, it had sunk 56 UK and allied ships in just 13 months.UC47\u0027s end came on 18 November, 1917. All 26 of her crew went down with her. The historical record shows that, through sheer chance, the British patrol boat spotted the German U-boat about 200 yards away, approximately one hour before sunrise. Within 15 seconds, the Royal Navy vessel launched a devastating surprise attack on the German submarine by ramming her. The impact, at 17 knots, tore through the German vessel\u0027s hull, causing her to start filling up with water. The British vessel then dropped two depth charges on the stricken sub – and quickly marked the position with a buoy.Orkney’s shipwreck graveyard is bursting with lifeA third depth charge was then dropped on the sunken U-boat – and a fourth was targeted at the German vessel as she lay on the seabed at 4pm on 19 November. Large amounts of oil and air bubbles continuously rose from  the wreck to the surface. HMS P57 remained at the attack site for around three whole days. Even as late as 20 November, two days after the attack, personnel on board the British vessel saw very large air bubbles rising to the surface – so there were obviously still sizeable pockets of air in the sunken sub as she languished on the sea floor.The two unmanned ultra-high-tech modern submarines used in the University of Southampton investigation of the German U-boat are operated by the Swedish offshore survey company, MMT – and owned by the Norwegian firm, Reach Subsea. The investigation into the wreck is being carried out by the university\u0027s Centre for Maritime Archaeology, as part of that centre\u0027s Offshore Archaeological Research programme.“As our investigation continues, we hope to progressively shed more light on this long-forgotten deadly North Sea drama,” said the project\u0027s historical adviser, Stephen Fisher.University of Southampton\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The European Research Group of Tory MPs which drove the UK to a hard Brexit is branded “a corruption of Conservatism” by a senior party figure, in a new book.The organisation – which wrecked Theresa May’s agreement, leading to Boris Johnson’s hardline EU exit – is made up of “climate change deniers” who “were quite happy to see Trump win”, a former colleague says.The book, by the journalist Peter Geoghegan, seeks to map the transformation of the once little-known ERG into an ultra-powerful player in Conservative politics, as the Brexit fight developed.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDespite not taking a public stance at the 2016 referendum, it then campaigned for a clean break from Brussels and was instrumental in defeating Ms May’s attempts at compromise.Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister who stood down last December, told the author of Democracy for Sale: Dark Money and Dirty Politics: “It morphed into a no-deal Brexit sect.”Fears of dead chicks in lorries and 10 months of chaos after BrexitAnd Tom Tugendhat, the influential Tory chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, was damning in his verdict of the group, now led by the outspoken Mark Francois.“It’s a corruption of Conservatism.

It’s the very opposite of what it means to be a Conservative,” Mr Tugendhat said.The ERG – formed way back in 1993, to oppose closer EU integration – was attacked as a “party within a party” for its trench warfare against the former prime minister.It ran its own whipping operation to defeat her deal, prompting Anna Soubry, then a Tory MP, to say Jacob Rees-Mogg was “running our country.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers, from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that with increased levels of testing and effective contact tracing “an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyHowever, they warned: “Reopening schools fully in September, alongside reopening workplaces in society, without an effective test, trace, isolating (TTI) strategy could result in a second wave of infections between two and 2.3 times the size of the original wave.”“Currently, TTI is not achieving the levels that we modelled. Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage.”Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, a lecturer in mathematical modelling at the Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL and lead author of the study, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that if test and trace is “not done effectively, then there is a risk of an occurrence of a second wave later this year”.Pressed on the study, Mr Clarke told Sky News: “It’s obviously vital that we always continue to keep up the progress that we’re making with test and trace, which is a massive national undertaking and it is working, I really would emphasise that.” The housing minister said over 184,000 people have so far been contacted by the NHS test and trace programme after a contact tested positive for the virus. He added: “Those people have been allowed to self-isolate, be removed from the community at a time where they could be at risk of spreading the virus and that’s obviously a massive success.

So this is a programme, which is delivering and which is helping to keep us all safer. There’s always more to do, we continue to work very hard to boost our testing capacity – we’re on track to deliver half a million be the end of October. “But one thing is clear: schools are going to reopen in full in autumn, that is not up for debate.”Speaking in the Commons after the decision to drop the target of returning all primary school children back to classrooms before the summer holidays, Boris Johnson said “primary and secondary education will recommence in September with full attendance”.No 10 yesterday reiterated the prime minister’s commitment, adding: “That’s vital for their education and development. We are planning for all pupils to return to school full-time from the beginning of the autumn term.”Schools reopening ‘risks second Covid-19 wave twice as big as first’Mr Clarke added: “There’s nothing gung-ho about getting schools back. There is little doubt about the major damage that it does to children’s education not to be in school. We’ve lost half a year now to this virus and some children’s education and it’s disrupted every child’s education.“It’s an absolute priority that we get on with this, it is a basic matter of social justice, there is a generation of children whose performance will be inhibited throughout the rest of their time in education unless we get this right and we’re confident that we can.”Speaking to Times Radio, former prime minister Tony Blair also urged the government to appoint a senior minister to be put in charge of testing, adding: “From the very beginning mass testing has been the only thing that gets you through this. “It allows you to avoid the severity of the very blunt instrument of lockdown and gets you to a place where you can more or less get your economy moving while you contain this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Many Kashmiris would prefer the region be granted independence from both countries, but there is no clear opinion polling on where the majority view lies.India said it revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and removed protections on settlement from the rest of India in order to foster greater investment in the region and bring its people equality with the rest of the country.Kashmir’s internet shutdown is risking lives during the pandemicDeadly clashes erupt between Kashmir protesters and Indian troopsLabour MP Abrahams denied entry to India and ‘treated like criminal’Modi challenged in court over ‘draconian’ use of colonial-era lawsHundreds protest India’s treatment of Kashmir in LondonBut many ethnic Kashmiris see the move as an attempt to use settlers to engineer a demographic change in India’s only Muslim-majority region. And they have been left feeling disenfranchised by a move in which they were not consulted, and which was accompanied by the house arrest of the leaders of all the major local political parties.Speaking to The Independent, residents of Kashmir described how a year of crackdown followed by pandemic lockdown has frozen their economy and denied them basic rights to justice, freedom of speech, access to education and the internet.It is not known exactly how many people were arrested in Kashmir just before and in the aftermath of 5 August 2019, mostly because they were detained under the controversial Public Safety Act (PSA) which allows suspects to be held without charge or any due process for up to two years.While court records suggest 662 petitions challenging PSA detentions were filed in 2019, Habeel Iqbal, a 34-year-old human rights lawyer from South Kashmir’s Shopian district, said he believes detentions over the last year number in the “thousands”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While some internet services were restored in January, faster 4G mobile networks remain blocked and business leaders say 2G services are too slow for most commercial enterprises to operate on.Anam Khan, a young Kashmiri businesswoman who returned to the region to acquire the Books and Bricks cafe in Srinagar just two months before the August 2019 crackdown, said bricks-and-mortar businesses have ground to a halt as well.Even when movement restrictions eased a little in October, the cafe “struggled to keep afloat through the winter months”, she said. Then, just as business started to pick up in February, “the pandemic broke”.India’s top court rules ban on internet in Kashmir ‘unconstitutional’“For a young entrepreneur who invested in her dream and in a city she loved, I feel crushed every single day. For a Kashmiri, our loss is not just monetary, it is emotional as well.”Ms Khan said she had been receiving mental health treatment after the uncertainty and emotional strain reached a threshold “beyond what I could have handled”. “It is very hard to go on with each day when you feel torn on the inside, but what options do I have?”The lack of internet access has hurt all aspects of Kashmiri society, but students have been particularly badly affected, according to Aabid Mustaq, a 21-year-old fourth year law student at Kashmir University.Being unable to access online resources has impacted “the whole process of researching for our studies”, he said. “I have found myself stagnant as I can’t access realtime time new judgements. If the internet is barred, that ultimately directly jeopardises our whole degree.”Monitoring groups say that India has become the world’s leading country in internet shutdowns, with the majority taking place in Kashmir.Anuradha Bhasin, the editor of the region’s largest English-language daily newspaper in the Kashmir Times, told a panel discussion marking the anniversary that the internet ban had “pushed a certain population behind an iron wall”.“The world is talking about work-from-home culture, talking about online. These kind of things do not work in this place. I think that very notion of equality, on the basis of which the people of Jammu and Kashmir were deprived of their special status, has been violated.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But nothing was done, the condition of the material in Hanger 12 continued to deteriorate, and then came the devastating explosion killing more than a hundred people and injuring 4,000 – a blast so powerful that it was felt in Cyprus 120 miles away.President Michel Aoun declared a three-day mourning period, and said the government will release £ 50.5 million in emergency funding.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe called the failure to deal with ammonium nitrate “unacceptable” and pledged “harshest punishment” for those responsible.Lebanon’s cabinet announced later on Wednesday it would be placing all of Beirut’s port officials who were responsible for storage and security since 2014 under house arrest.Lebanon declares state of emergency over Beirut explosion – updatesThere will also be an investigation into what happened, but the denouement of “harshest punishment” is likely to take a long time. A verdict is expected this week by a UN backed court into the killing of former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri – 15 years after his death.The ammonium nitrate, a substance which can be used to make bombs as well as for commercial use such as fertiliser and mining explosives, had arrived in Beirut in September 2013 on board the Russian owned, Moldovan flagged bound for Beira in Mozambique from Batumi in Georgia.It had docked in Beirut after reporting engine trouble. Lebanese officials prevented the ship from continuing its journey citing safety concerns by Port State Control officers. Most of the Ukrainian crew were repatriated on the grounds that they were in “imminent danger” due to the material on board. The vessel was eventually abandoned by its owners.The Lebanese authorities impounded the cargo and put it in the hangar, a large structure which faces the highway at the main entrance to the capital.There the material stayed there for months. Then, leaked official documents show, the director of customs, Shafik Merhi, sent a letter to the ‘Urgent Matters Judge’ pointing the need to decide what to do with it.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailCustoms officials, according to these records circulating in Lebanon, sent at least five more letters between 5th December 2014 and 27th October stressing the need for the ammonium nitrate to be moved. The options proposed were exporting the material, selling it to a privately owned Lebanese Explosives Company, or asking the army to collect it.One letter sent in 2016 said: “In view of the serious danger of keeping these goods in the hangar in unsuitable climatic conditions, we reaffirm our request to please request the marine agency to re-export these goods immediately to preserve the safety of the port and those working on it or to look into agreeing to sell this amount” to the Lebanese Explosives Company.The letter recorded that there had been no replies from judges to previous requests. There was no reply to this letter either.A year later, in October 2017, a new customs director, Badri Daher, sent another letter to a judge asking for a decision in view of “the danger... of leaving these goods in the place they are, and to those working there.”The Reuters news agency reported that the issue of storing the material had come before several committees and judges and “nothing was done”. It also stated that a team that inspected the cargo six months ago warned that it could “blow up all of Beirut” if not removed.Officials said a fire appears to have started at Hangar 9 and spread to Hangar 12 detonating the ammonium nitrate. The substance, however, is not an explosive by itself, but an oxidiser, drawing oxygen to a fire and making it rage faster and further.Beirut port officials to be put under house arrest following blastsTimeline of events leading up to Beirut explosionsBeirut explosion: Before and after pictures show extent of damagePriest dodges falling rubble as Beirut explosion hits during massPollutants would also add to the flames. “That’s what may have happened, the ammonium nitrate got something added to it accidentally, possibly oil or some other flammable compound. Ammonium nitrate smoke is more yellow, this is rather red.  An investigation would ascertain if that is the case and where contamination took place,” said Robert Emerson, a British security analyst.Ammonium nitrate has been used in explosive devices by military forces in many countries. It has also been used in several terrorist attacks, including the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 by right-wing extremists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nicholls, which destroyed a federal building and killed 168 people.Donald Trump told reporters at the White House: “ It would seem like it was based on the explosion. I met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not a – some kind of manufacturing explosion type of event... They seem to think it was an attack. It was a bomb of some kind, yes.”The Pentagon refused to comment on Mr Trump’s claims, referring it back to the White House. Defence officials told several American media outlets that there was no evidence that the explosion was a deliberate attack. State Department sources said Lebanese officials had raised concern with US diplomats about the President’s choice of language.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For hundreds of thousands in Beirut, the wreckage caused by Tuesday’s colossal explosion came as a shock that will take some time to process. For the former crew of a Russian-owned vessel abandoned in the docks in late 2013, it came as less of a surprise. On Tuesday evening, local media reported the blast was caused by the explosion of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been transferred from the Rhosus cargo ship in 2014. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Rhosus sailed under a Moldovan flag but was reportedly owned by Igor Grechushkin, a native of Khabarovsk in Russia’s Far East, and was manned by a crew of Russians and Ukrainians.According to contemporary reports, the Rhosus was scheduled to transport its cargo from the Georgian port of Batumi to Biera in Mozambique in late 2013. But along the way it fell into technical problems, and failed a safety inspection in Beirut. Some time later, the ship was seized after its owner apparently ran out of money or willingness to pay port fees. Search for survivors as Beirut wakes up to huge devastation – updatesIn July 2014, with his crew essentially hostages and running out of provisions, Captain Boris Prokoshev warned of the dangers of his cargo. “We’ve been here since October, with a cargo of ammonium nitrate, an explosive substance, in the hold,” he told a journalist of the Ukrainian Sailor newspaper. “We’ve been abandoned, living with no wage on a powder keg for the last 10 months.”A Russian newspaper that reported on the situation carried a headline that reads especially eerily today: “Crew of the Rhosus cargo ship are hostages aboard a floating bomb.” According to Captain Prokoshev, the owner of the vessel ended up owing the crew upwards of US 200,000 dollars in wages. Social media posts about the reported owner, Mr Grechushkin, and his company, Teto Shipping Ltd, contain several claims of non payment.Natalya Klamm, director of the Odessa-based Assol foundation, which assisted the sailors at the time, told The Independent the situation the men found themselves was not unique.

Yes, people were happy when they were eventually released, but it was six years ago and frankly it wasn’t so unusual to remember an awful lot about it.” Following representations by Ukrainian diplomats, local authorities agreed to release five of the sailors. The Russian captain and three senior Ukrainian crewmen stayed onboard — and would only be allowed to travel home in September 2014. Around that time, authorities granted permission for the dangerous cargo to be disembarked for “safekeeping” in the Beirut port’s warehouse number 12. The transfer is recorded in an article written by two lawyers in Arrest News in October 2015.Lebanon President Michel Aoun described the failure to deal with the stockpile of ammonium nitrate as “unacceptable” and said those responsible would face the harshest punishment.”A probe has now been launched, with the investigating committee expected to present findings within five days.Early reports suggest the explosion followed repair work to the warehouse, sparks from which caused unidentified pellets to explode — and following that, the ammonium nitrate.

their ground-floor flat was a prime target for criminals.She wrote: Though I envied David and Fiona with their sea view, being on the ground floor meant we didn’t have to worry about the children’s safety on a balcony.Later, we were told by the British police that the ground-floor location, access to roads front and side, secluded entrance and partial tree cover made our apartment a prime target for burglars and criminals.The book has resurfaced for the latest push to find Madeleine and solve her disappearance - with Christian B currently the prime suspect in the case.Follow our live blog for all the latest news and updates.Madeleine McCann was three when she disappeared while on holiday with her family in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May  .German investigators have alleged that Christian B, , killed her soon after abducting her from a holiday apartment in the resort.That’s despite British police continuing to treat her vanishing as a missing persons probe.He is in jail in Germany for drug dealing, and is appealing against a conviction for the  rape of a -year-old woman, also at Praia da Luz.The paedo is a suspect in a string of unsolved crimes, reportedly including an alleged attack on a -year-old British girl in the resort in , one of a series of incidents where young girls were targeted.German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the investigation into him, previously told the PA news agency that prosecutors have “concrete evidence”, but not “forensic evidence” that Madeleine was killed by the suspect.He said they may “know more” than Scotland Yard, who are still treating the case as a missing person investigation.There has also been search activity in Portugal.Earlier this month police and ers in the Algarve examined three disused wells around  miles from Praia da Luz.The new suspect in the Madeleine McCann case once lived in a squalid villa in Portugal – just a few miles from where the youngster went missing in The Algarve.Pics of the “disgusting and vile” farmhouse-style property show rubbish scattered outside and a badly overgrown garden.Neighbours in Portugal described its former resident as an “angry” man who vanished suddenly after leaving a bizarre collection of wigs and exotic clothing.One told Sky News: “He arrived in the mid-nineties and rented the place from the English owner.“He went back to Germany at one stage and moved another German guy in to look after it, then came back and threw him out on the street.“He was always a bit angry, driving fast up and down the lane, and then one day, around , he just disappeared without a word.#The woman then added: “About six months later I was asked to help clean up the place and it was disgusting, absolutely vile.“It had been trashed, with broken stuff like computers all over the place.“We found a bin bag and inside were wigs and exotic clothing, whether just fancy dress or something stranger I couldnt tell.”She revealed she was later contacted by Scotland Yard who quizzed her about her former neighbour.Madeleine McCanns disappearance from the holiday resort of Praia da Luz  years ago sparked one of the biggest missing person hunts in modern history.Praia da Luz, known simply as Luz, is a parish located around four miles from Lagos in the Algarve, Portugal.The community had a population of just , when a census was last carried out in .Once a small fishing village, its been dubbed #little Britain# for the concentration of Brits who take holidays there.Julia Meyer, a spokeswoman for the prosecutors office in Braunschweig, told The Sun today that there is still #no comment# in regards to last weeks dig of an allotment in Hanover.She added: #We currently have no plans to issue a statement about the search.#We are currently not commenting on the ongoing investigation.#Kate McCann made a “horror” discovery while combing through police files on her daughter’s discovery.The heartbroken mum revealed in her book how the family’s routine with friends they were holidaying with could have been easily monitored by anyone watching them.A friend of the family had made a block booking at a tapas restaurant close to their apartment so they could check on their young children intermittently.She wrote: “It wasn’t until a year later, when I was combing through the Portuguese police files that I discovered that the note requesting our block booking was written in a staff message book, which sat on a desk at the pool reception for most of the day.“This book was by definition accessible to all staff and, albeit unintentionally, probably to guests and visitors, too.“To my horror, I saw that, no doubt in all innocence and simply to explain why she was bending the rules a bit, the receptionist had added the reason for our request.“[It was because] we wanted to eat close to our apartment as we were leaving our young children alone there and checking on them intermittently.”Madeleine McCann was three when she disappeared while on holiday with her family in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May  .German investigators have alleged that Christian B, , killed her soon after abducting her from a holiday apartment in the

but not “forensic evidence” that Madeleine was killed by the suspect.He said they may “know more” than Scotland Yard, who are still treating the case as a missing person investigation.In her book Madeleine: Our Daughters Disappearance and the Continuing Search for Her, Kate McCann details how their ground-floor apartment was a “prime” spot for criminals.She wrote: “Though I envied David and Fiona with their sea view, being on the ground floor meant we didn’t have to worry about the children’s safety on a balcony.”Kate continues: “Later, we were told by the British police that the ground-floor location, access to roads front and side, secluded entrance and partial tree cover made our apartment a prime target for burglars and criminals.“Never once did this occur to us when we arrived.”Christian B kept kids’ clothes and swimwear in his mobile home, it has emerged.Convicted paedophile Christian B, , bought the red and white Allegro Bay RV in early  — three years after moving back to his native Germany from Portugal.Pals said he used it to drive regularly back and forth between Germany, Spain and Portugal and once boasted how he could allegedly “carry children and drugs” inside.Cops found the clothes and swimwear after seizing the RV as part of their probe into missing Inga Gehricke, who disappeared in  during a picnic with her parents.Christian B used a derelict crate factory at Neuwegers­leben as a weekend pad where he kept the RV.The items were found there in  along with USB sticks containing images of child sex abuse.Other images on the sticks included some of Christian B partially naked or wearing stockings performing a solo sex act.The six data sticks and two memory cards were found buried under the body of his dog at the factory, wrapped in a carrier bag.The prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann has been cleared of involvement in the rape and murder of another young girl.Christian B had been a suspect in the  killing of Claudia Ruf, , whose partly burned body was found  miles from the German town of Grevenbroich.She had been kidnapped while walking a neighbours dog.In an update this week, however, it was confirmed that he couldnt have been Claudias killer.#After comparing the information obtained, it can be said that Christian B was not in Grevenbroich at the time of the crime in the case of Claudia Ruf,# a police spokesman told Bild.#In addition, a DNA comparison is said to have been negative.#Last year, police in Grevenbroich started DNA tests on hundreds of men as they hoped for a breakthrough in the unsolved murder investigation.It will probably take until the end of  to complete the DNA screening with approximately  samples, Bild reports.Kate McCann still buys birthday and Christmas presents for missing Madeleine in the hope she will one day come home to open them.She has told how she carefully chooses gts every year that are the right age for her daughter # who would have turned  in May.Madeleine was nine days short of her fourth birthday when she was abducted on a family holiday in Portugal on May , .Kate, husband Gerry and their twins Sean and Amelie hold a birthday tea party every May  and put presents in Madeleines unchanged pink bedroom.On the tenth anniversary of Maddies disappearance, ex-GP Kate said: “I do all the present buying.#I think about what age she is and buy something that, whenever we find her, will still be appropriate so there’s a lot of thought goes into it.”She referred to the birthday of her eldest child as a #dficult time because that’s when you really feel her absence.”Cops from Britain, Germany and Portugal worked together in secret for three years to track down the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.Officers revealed in June this year that a -year-old German paedophile is their top suspect following a -year investigation.He was living in a campervan in Praia da Luz in Portugal around the time the youngster was abducted on May , .It wasnt until , ten years after the little girl went missing, that he became a key suspect after police appealed for information on where Madeleine could be.The call for help sparked a tip-off about a German man who was known to have been in the area at the time.And Thereports that, for the past three years, officers from the Met have been secretly working with Germany’s Bundeskriminalamtand Portugal’s Policia Judiciaria to track their man down.The Met’s Operation Grange team, led by Detective Inspector Mark Cranwell, spent months working on the tip about the unknown German, before contacting the BKA in November  to ask for their help.Madeleine McCann’s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, said on their website http:wwwmadeleine that their hope of seeing their daughter again had not faded.“All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice,” the couple wrote.“We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know as we need to find peace.”They added in a June  update: “We would like to thank the police forces involved for their continued efforts in the search for Madeleine.”Police searching the cellar of Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B are looking for evidence of a murder, the editor of Bild newspaper has claimed.Cops in Germany last week excavated an allotment known to have been used by Christian, and are rumoured to be planning a search of a second.Convicted sex offender Christian B, , was named by police as a prime suspect in the McCann case in June.He is known to have been living in the Praia de Luz resort around the time of Madeleines disappearance in , and at some time after to have ed to his native Germany.Julian Reichelt, editor of German tabloid Bild, has claimed they were searching for evidence of a murder.#What we are hearing from our sources is that they have moved into the direction of recovering and finding evidence that will make this a murder case clearly to everyone,# he told Good Morning Britain.#The German investigation has declared this a murder case but so far it is completely unclear to the public how that is, what proof makes this a murder case and not a case of missing child to them.#Our sources have told us they are now looking at this one allotment and possibly the second one for that piece of evidence that will clearly publicly turn this into a murder case.#What they have found there they have not commented on.#In Luxembourg, a court opinion is being sought in an appeal involving Madeleine McCann

I loved the portrayal of the young princess in the Netflix series: Down to earth, feisty and straightforward, which I suspect is accurate to a tee.I have always wondered whether the royals watch the drama and Princess Anne revealed she did and found it “quite interesting”.She was followed for more than a year by the filmmakers of Anne: The Princess Royal At , which also featured unseen family footage and interviews with her loved ones.I loved the stories from her children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, describing how she wouldfrom royal s in her glamorous outfits and head straight to their farm to tend to the animals.Zara said: “She’d come home from engagements in exactly what she was wearing, make-up on, put her welly boots on, jacket on, do her chickens and get her eggs.”The appealing thing about Princess Anne is her work ethic and how happy she is to stay in the background.Her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, said: “She’s not a person that is constantly looking for praise. She gets on and does her work regardless because she thinks it’s important.”So it came as no surprise when Anne declared in the documentary that she would not go on Twitter “evenyou paid me”.Princess Anne is not the only hard-working royal, of course.Her brother Prince Edward and his we Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, do loads of good work and are similarly modest in their approach.These members of the Royal Family are in stark contrast to Harry and Meghan, who claim that work is more important than anything , but rarely get on with it quietly.After all, Princess Anne does her job brilliantly, with no whinging or whining, and still remains out of the spotlight, which proves it can be done.Another appealing trait of Anne’s is her modesty about how hard she works. She has no intention of slowing down, despite being old enough to retire.She’s a credit to her family and the Queen — and the two of them clearly have a lot in common.I loved watching them interact and seeing that mother-daughter bond. You can see there’s real affection there. And what a great, dry sense of humour they both have.So it’s nice to watch something positive about the Royal Family these days.By simply being herself in the documentary, Princess Anne has generated more positive PR for the monarchy than it has had in a very long while.LOOKING at pictures of Gwyneth Paltrow on Instagram promoting a ready-to-drink brand of organic cocktails, I found myself thinking that no matter how much some people want to hate her, Gwyneth comes across as enviably wholesome, gorgeous, healthy . . . and probably a really nice person.The bottom line is that anyone who says they hate her is almost certainly just jealous.I AM so proud our national game has signed up to the Mentally Healthy Football Declaration, which urges young men – and men of all ages, in fact – to talk about their feelings, which is something males traditionally seem to struggle with.We can talk about the THEORY of mental health all we like but the power of role models, particularly for young guys, is immense.So it is lovely to see some footballing greats being open and honest about their own mental health – and the fact things haven’t always necessarily been rosy in the garden throughout their lives.Spearheaded by the Duke of Cambridge, the campaign is designed to make mental health a priority across all levels of football.So kudos to former England captain David Beckham, Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings, Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend and Manchester City and England skipper Steph Houghton for talking frankly about their own mental health and the state of play in football more generally.Beckham, in particular, yields great influence. Hearing him talk about the effects of being vilied and abused by fans after he was red-carded against Argentina in the  World Cup was very powerful.“When I look back on it now, I didn’t realise how hard it was,” he says. “The times I’ve faced adversity throughout my career – and ’ was by far the toughest – did I feel OK to go to someone and say I needed help  No. I felt I had to keep it all in and deal with it myself.“Now I’m preaching to my kids and to other kids that it’s really important to talk. It’s OK not to be OK and it’s OK to say that. It’s OK to come out and say, ‘I need help’.”Let’s hope young men everywhere take that on board and realise it’s good to talk.People with a negative outlook about the present or future die two years earlier than the average person, according to new research.According to the Aussie team that did the research, from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, one reason for this might be that pessimists do not look after themselves as well, which has an impact on their health.The world is half-full of pessimists . . . or half-empty, depending on how you look at it. But the bottom line is that a positive mind and spirit equal positive outcomes, while a negative mind and spirit equal negative outcomes.So let’s all start looking on the bright side, shall we  Good. I am SO glad we had this chat.HEARING what it takes for models to look the way they do is always interesting.And by “interesting”, I mean it gives us a helpful reminder of how unrealistic expectations can be for women over their appearance.Brazilian model Vanusa Freitas,  – who clearly DOES look amazing – has shared the secret of how she looks the way she does.In preparation for a Playboy Portugal shoot, Vanusa exercised for eight hours a day and ate only egg whites.She said she was inspired by Kim Kardashian, which perhaps gave her the necessary discipline to deny herself food and, by the sound of things, time to do much  but work out.If spending the day in the gym and eating only egg whites is what is required to look like her, well . . . frankly, I’d rather have a le.Just reading the story made me feel sick.Roger Spackman, , was a Labour member of Exeter City Council until his arrest in  and worked at a secure children’s home.But the judge assessing his case this week decided Spackman would not himself commit abuse – so handed him only a suspended jail term.Yet the reality is that, by possessing these images, he is part of a cycle of horric abuse.Forty days of rehab is not going to change his desire to look at this kind of material.Time in prison would be a more fitting consequence – and perhaps some deterrent for the people who produce horric, disturbing images of children being harmed.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The source said a fire had started at warehouse  of the port and spread to warehouse , where the ammonium nitrate was stored.Badri Daher, Director General of Lebanese Customs claimed customs had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger.We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why, he said.Another source said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned thatit was not moved it would blow up all of Beirut.The explosion erupted next to a towering building called the Beirut Port Silos, which could be seen partially collapsed amid the rubble of nearby buildings.The intensity of the blast threw victims into the sea and rescue teams were today still trying to recover bodies.Many of those killed were port and custom employees and people working in the area or driving through during rush hour.The blast also knocked out a crater some  metersacross that filled with seawater.Those leading the rescue effort today chillingly warned the death toll is likely to rise.Images taken from the scene showed a thick cloud of gray smoke hovering over the Mediterranean before an enormous burst of red and orange fumes exploded into the sky.Up to , people have also now been left homeless by the explosion which caused around £bn of damage, claimed local reports.At hospitals across the city people had been waiting all night for news of loved ones who had gone missing or were wounded.

This “shock wave” is essentially a wall of dense air that can cause damage as it spreads. A mass of exploding ammonium nitrate produces a blast that moves at many times the speed of sound.This wave can reflect and bounce as it moves destroying some buildings while leaving others relatively undamaged.The explosive power of ammonium nitrate can be as high as about  percent of the power of TNT.At  percent the power of TNT, the detonation of , tons of ammonium nitrate could produce a shock wave felt over a mile away.The same explosion would produce enough force at a range of  feet to destroy most buildings, and kill people either through direct trauma or being struck by debris.In , a ship carrying an estimated , tons of ammonium nitrate caught fire and exploded in the harbor of Texas City, Texas, starting a chain reaction of blasts and blazes that killed  people.Its like a war zone.

There will be people who refuse to pay.”Four and a half million pensioners will be sent a -page letter and application form when then their licence expires.Each household should submit photocopies of their documents from the Department for Work and Pensions or the Pension Service to prove that they are in receipt of pension credit.A bank statement will also be acceptedthey don’t have access to a photocopier.The BBC agreed to make over-s exempt from the fee back in  after an agreement was hammered out with the Government.The subsidy will continue to be offered to over-s on pension credit – which includes those on a weekly income below £. and couples on less than £..But Corporation bosses have since said the BBC cannot afford to continue the universal entitlement, which would hit programmes and services.The move has been slammed by campaigners and politicians with Boris Johnson saying the Beeb has made the “wrong decision”.An official spokesman for the PM said last month: We recognise the value of free TV licences for over-s and believe that they should be funded by the BBC.Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said it was a “sad day” for elderly Brits who feel like they are being “let down” by the government and the BBC.She said that more than half a million of the poorest pensioners will still have to pay for a licence, cut spending on other essentials like food or heating, give up TV altogether or keep watching without a licence, in breach of the law because they still do not qualy for pension credit.It is deplorable that any older person should have to make such a horrible choice.”However, the BBC said maintaining the subsidy would cost £million a year and would lead to the closure of BBC Two as well as other channels and radio station.A spokeswoman said: It was the Government that ended funding for over-s TV licences and that the BBC has made the fairest decision possible to support the poorest, oldest pensioners.She added: Critically, it isnt the BBC making judgments about poverty - the Government sets and controls pension credit.The decision to start the new scheme in August has not been easy but delaying the introduction has cost the BBC over £ million and we cannot afford to delay any further.Continuing with the Government scheme would have cost £ million a year and rising and would have meant the closures of BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland channel, Radio  Live, and a number of local radio stations.These closures would profoundly damage the BBC for everyone, especially older people who use the BBC the most.A Department for Digital, Culture, Media  Sport spokesperson said: We are bitterly disappointed by the BBCs decision not to extend the over  licence fee concession beyond August.The BBC remains responsible for the concession and for setting out what those affected will now need to do. It must now look urgently at how it can use its substantial licence fee income to deliver for audiences of all ages, including by making efficiencies.The DCMS says the Government agreed a deal with the BBC in , which the director-general said provided financial stability.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I believe this was a show trial.Being well known should not allow special treatment, but should not allow making an example of someone.Caroline killed herself on February , a day after she had learned the CPS was pursuing charges that she allegedly attacked her boyfriend Lewis Burton, , with a lamp.Her mum blasted the claims today and told the inquest she had received a written apology from the chief crown prosecutor over the lamp accusation. She added: A lamp was never involved in the assault. It was a phone. I feel that the prosecutor was unkind to Caroline and to my family.I was threatened with arrest when I tried to speak.Her sister Jody said this morning Caroline was in a very anxious state of mind before her death, adding in a statement an ambulance had been called for her four times previously.An ambulance had been called to Carolines house the night before she died due to pals concerns for her - but she told paramedics she didnt want to go to hospital.Jody told how the TV star spent the last few months of her le at home after being arrested, adding: Caroline seemed very sad the day before her death - she seemed to have lost her fight.Detective Inspector Lauren Bateman and Lisa Ramsarran, deputy chief crown prosecutor for the CPS, spoke today about the decision to charge Caroline.Coroner Mary Hassell said nobody is on trial here, least of all Caroline, as she warned she would not try the case of the original allegation.Caroline had pleaded not guilty to assault by beating and had strongly denied the charge, with her family and management slamming the CPS for pursuing the case.The stars family had increased concerns about her mental state as the trial loomed, while Mr Burton also pleaded to the CPS to drop the case.The inquest heard Caroline had left a handwritten note referencing boyfriend Lewis.

We thought about phoning the police but knew the landlady... We got the key and let ourselves into the flat.Mr Teasdale added: We were giving CPR for somewhere between five and ten minutes, then the police took over.Lewis today said Caroline was devastated when he last saw her - worrying about losing her job on Love Island and not being able to see him.In a statement read to the inquest he said: The last time [I] saw Caroline she was very upset, in fact devastated, she was not in a good place emotionally.Sometimes she talked about taking her own le when she was extremely upset.Caroline was declared dead at the scene and her body identied by her twin sister.The coroners court heard no traces of alcohol were found in her system, but there was the presence of a drug used for insomnia.Tamsin Lewis, a psychiatrist and lestyle medical practitioner, said in a statement Caroline was distressed and had been having trouble sleeping.She said: She reported having panicky feelings all day... a sense of impending doom.Mollie Grosberg, another of Flacks long-standing friends, appeared via videolink to give evidence in the inquest. She told the coroner how Flack was very loving.She wasnt like a typical celebrity, you would feel very comfortable around her. Its left a big hole for a lot of people.The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.A family lawyer previously said the television personality died by suicide.Her death prompted an outpouring of sorrow from celebrity friends, colleagues and fans, who referenced one of her social media posts from December in which she urged people to be kind.It doesnt discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.Its the biggest killer of people under the age of , more deadly than cancer and car crashes.And men are three times more likely to take their own le than women.Yet its rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.That is why The Sun launched the Youre Not Alone campaign.The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.Lets all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others...

Mr Gibb said the Government would steer clear of reimposing national school closures to curb the virus, despite warnings opening up classrooms could cause a second wave by December. He stressed that all the areas currently forced to follow stricter rules than the rest of the country would see their kids finally go back to class. But when pushed he did not rule out some schools needing to shut up shop againthere are local spikes in cases. He said: Were now looking locally at when we impose new restrictions - they will be locally imposed.But so far as the current local restrictions at the moment go including in Manchester all schools will be open in September, and indeed in other parts where there have been local lockdowns such as Leicester.Mr Gibb said schools would be safe - even after the warnings of a second spike - and they had introduced hygiene measures including hand washing and staggered lunch breaks to stop the spread of Covid-. Childrens Commissioner Anne Longfield has demanded kids education is made a national priority and is put before pubs and restaurants. She called for regular testing of pupils and teachers - regardless of whether they show symptoms. Laying down a marker on future closures, she wrote: “If the choice has to be made in a local area about whether to keep pubs or schools open, then schools must always take priority.”Ms Longfields briefing paper says keeping schools open should be the absolute priority, adding: Education should be prioritised over other sectors: first to open, last to close.When only a limited amount of social interaction is feasible, the amount accounted for by education must be protected - at the expense of other sectors activities.Responding to Ms Longfield, Mr Gibb said this morning: Anne Longfield is right. Its very important for children to be in schools. Its best for their education, its best for their wellbeing, its better for them to be with their friends and with their teachers.And that is the Governments clear policy.   To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was originally reported by some as a hit and run, but investigations indicated that racist language was used at the scene and it was then treated by the police as a racially aggravated attack.“The victim’s family were anxious the incident should be seen and understood by the wider public.“It’s, for this reason, they asked us specically to show the photos of this man’s injuries and were also determined that we should report the racist language, in full, alleged to have been spoken by the occupants of the car.”The statement added the decision to use the word was made by “senior editorial figures”.It added: “Notwithstanding the family’s wishes, we independently considered whether the use of the highly offensive word was editorially justied given the context. “The decision to use the word was not taken lightly and without considerable detailed thought: we were aware that it would cause offence.”The bulletin, which originally aired last Wednesday, was quickly removed from the BBC website after viewers expressed their outrage on Twitter.One person said: “I really don’t think that word was necessary. Saying racial slur would have been enough.”Another wrote: “As a woman of colour I am highly offended at this! Such a demonstration of poor judgement and zero sensitivity exercised here especially in light of the times we are currently facing, completely disgraceful!”Others were also horried to hear the word on day-time TV and shared their disbelief online.

The rule not to travel further than five miles away from your home has also been reinstated in the Aberdeen City Council area and residents have been told not visit each other in houses.Single adult households who have joined up in a support bubble with another household can continue to visit. Ms Sturgeon also told people not to travel to Aberdeen.It comes just days after the Queen arrived in Scotland to spend time at her Balmoral estate over the summer.Her Majesty is staying around  miles outside of Aberdeen, and flew into the citys airport from RAF Northolt.The new rules in Aberdeen are far tougher than local lockdowns in Greater Manchester and parts of northern England - where people are no longer allowed to visit indoors, but can still head to the pub.There were  new cases of the virus Scotland wide. Nicola Sturgeon announced today: She said this lunchtime: So, a precautionary and careful judgement is that we need to take decisive action now - dficult though that undoubtedly is - in order to try and contain this outbreak and prevent further harm later on.This high number of cases certainly heightens our concern that we are dealing with a signicant outbreak in Aberdeen that may involve some community transmission.Now, the main link identied in this cluster has been the Hawthorn Bar in Aberdeen city centre, however more detailed analysis by NHS Grampian and Test  Protect has shown that this one venue does not account for all of the positive cases.The First Minister said changes will be reviewed every seven days starting next Wednesday when she hopes the restrictions could be removed either entirely or partially. Staff suddenly out of work will be able to be re-furloughed under the job retention scheme. The harsh restrictions could be extended to parts of Aberdeenshirethey need to be, Ms Sturgeon said.She added that the outbreak was a sharp reminder of what happenspeople let their guard drop and start behind like normal again. She said:should serve as a warning to all of us. It comes days before all kids are set to go back to school in Scotland from August .Ms Sturgeon said she took the decision after being struck by comments from the Childrens Commissioner for England Anne Longfield demanding schools should be allowed to open at all costs - evenit means shutting pubs. She said: As I said earlier, this is also about doing everything we can to ensure our children canto school next week.Aberdeen schools are holding orientation sessions next Wednesday, with schools due to open fully the following Monday, th August.Acting now, we judge, gives us the time and space to protect the ability of our young people toto education.Ms Sturgeon said the decision to close hospitality venues was not taken lightly but extreme caution was necessary to tackle any growth in coronavirus cases. She said: Im also mindful of the need to act quickly and decisivelywe are to succeed in our aim of keeping transmission as close to elimination levels as possible.Local MP Stephen Flynn tweeted following the announcement: Restrictions being put back in place in Aberdeen is what we all feared. However, they are an absolute necessity in order to protect public health. Everyone must adhere to the guidance being put in place by the First Minister today.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No parole, no reductions.Currently defendants under the age of  receive lower sentences, but Mrs Adlam believes this should end.Debbie added: As far as their age and the reductions go, my personal thoughts are there is no sense whatsoever in being  or  and getting time off your sentence.My gut turns when I think about that because you can change your gender, you can get a mortgage, you can serve in the Army, and the thing that really bugs me is you can be on a jury - yet you are not treated as an adult until youre  in the judicial system.That cant be right.It comes as PC Harpers widow, Lissie Harper, has launched her own Andrews Law campaign for full-le prison terms for those who kill emergency services workers.She said: I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference that this country clearly needs.I vow to stand strong and firm with so many other honourable people in our country to make the changes that we clearly know to be justied.Lissie shared a new picture of herself and PC Harper as she launched the campaign.Her cause is being backed by the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents thousands of officers up to the rank of chief inspector.The three teenagers were convicted of manslaughter over PC Harpers death, after he responded to a reported burglary.They were found not guilty of murdering the police officer after the jury had deliberated for almost two days.Henry Long, , Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both , hugged each other to the sound of their cheering families as the verdict of not guilty to murder was read out in court.Bowers and Cole were instead convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter - which Long had previously admitted.Long, who was driving the car when the Thames Valley Police officer was dragged to his death while responding to a quad bike theft on August , was caged for  years.Bowers and Cole were handed  years in prison and banned from driving for two years.But Attorney General Suella Braverman will now look into whether the jail time handed down was too lenient after a request to review the case.Lissie added: As a widow of a police officer - a title in which I would give everything to not have - I have witnessed first-hand the lenient and insufficient way in which the justice system deals with criminals who take the lives of our emergency workers.“I have grown close to our under-appreciated protectors ever more since the death of Andrew, I have been enveloped in love and support from not only the police and other emergency workers but so many of the general public too who I know fully support my feelings over the verdict and sentences in which Andrew’s killers have received.“The people responsible for wreaking utter despair and grief in all of our lives will spend an inadequate amount of time behind bars. These men who showed no remorse, no guilt or sorrow for taking such an innocent and heroic le away will find themselves able to live out the rest of their lives free and able to commit more crimes and continue to put people in danger when they are released in a very small number of years.”It came after the court heard a car driven by Long at breakneck speed swung PC Andrew Harper like a pendulum along a country lane on August , .PC Harper was in the process of apprehending the teen gang during a botched robbery near Reading, Berks.The jury came back with the verdict after deliberating for two days, which left his tearful widow Lissie in tears.Jurors were told how the traveller teens had tried to steal the £, bike from the home of Peter Wallis in remote Bradfield Southend, when they were apprehended by PC Harper.The gang had cased the property earlier in the day and later ed masked and armed with an axe, crowbars and aof pipe to use against anyone in their way. PC Harpers devastated widow Lissie wrote an open letter to Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Priti Patel and former Labour Home Secretary LordBlunkett urging them and others to right such a despicable wrong for our country.At sentencing, all three were warned they will not be eligible for release until they have served at least two thirds of their sentence - meaning leader of the gang Long could be back on the streets in just ten years.And his accomplices could be out in just eight yearsthey serve the minimum - despite Mr Justice Edis telling them the killing was very close to murder.The Attorney General has no power to order a retrial, and prosecutors would either need new and compelling evidence to apply for the acquittals to be quashed, or there would need to be proven interference with the jury.A spokesman for the Attorney Generals Office said: The Attorney Generals thoughts are with the family and friends of Pc Andrew Harper at this dficult time.I can confirm that we have received a request for the cases of Henry Long, Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole to be considered under the unduly lenient sentence scheme.The Law Officers have  days from sentencing to consider the case.In her letter to the Prime Minister Lissie Harper said she implored him to hear her request.She wrote: If there is even the slightest chance that this abominable injustice can be rectied then I will do everything I possibly can to ensure that it is.Lissie added: I implore you to hear my words, see the facts that are laid out before us, and I ask with no expectations other than hope that you might help me to make these changes be considered, to ensure that Andrew is given the retrial that he unquestionably deserves and to see that the justice system in our country is the solid ethical foundation that it rightly should be. Not the joke that so many of us now view it to be.The PMs spokesman said he would respond to Mrs Harpers letter formally once legal proceedings have concluded.”The killers families wept and gasped as the sentences were handed down, while Lissies mum Julie Beckett applauded.Sentencing, the judge said nothing he can do can “restore Andrew Harper to his loving we or family, adding: His devastating loss in terrible circumstances will follow his family for ever.”Describing the killers as young, unintelligent but professional criminals, he added none of them had shown anything resembling remorse.The soft sentences dished out to Long, Bowers and Cole were met with fury by social media users.One person wrote: Absolutely disgusting, no justice for him, his family or his beautul we. Another failing by the system.Another read: Disgraceful sentencing.One person fumed: So thats all his le was worth then  I feel sick at this verdict.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ornaments. Ephemera that gave colleagues, friends, family, or viewers suddenly spending % of the day in front of the television, an idea of your personality as you broadcast from the back bedroom.We established, or rearranged, our home offices, and removed things that were rude or incriminating from shot. The Royal Family had their staff set up the Zoom calls, and organise hundreds of photographs in strict order of precedence and favouritism. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, on the other hand, went with a bare wall.  To be fair, it is an million wall, in a mansion theyaposve been loaned, and it is probably the only background which didnapost have some gold in it. But their minimalist approach to public le is not only in stark contrast to the Royalsapos rather cluttered one - that wall weaposve seen so much of says everything about why Meghan and Harry have had such a bad pandemic. Their escape from protocol has not given them freedom - it provided an extra barrier, behind which they have little idea of the current mood. When coronavirus meant people were denied contact with each other, they yearned to connect remotely, and for background info to fill in the blanks. All the Sussexes gave them was another blank.William and Kate gave us only a cream wall and half-open door, but it at least raised possibilities of a small Royal child bombing in to demand some foie gras. And they did oversee some elderly gambling while using bingo lingo, which is up there on the list of top Royal moments that includes parachuting into the Olympics.Harry and Meghan do a good line in earnestness. Theyaposve spoken out on issues, like Black Lives Matter and repeated Joe Bidenaposs campaign slogans, which would have been deemed too politicalthey were still aposinapos the monarchy. But, as court filings have proven, they havenapost made the best decisions. They moved to the USA  hours after Donald Trump declared a national emergency, and now find themselves at the deadly epicentre of a pandemic. Theyaposve become mired in expensive court cases on two continents, and even in their protected private enclave are so plagued by drone-operating paparazzi that they havenapost just been locked down and sealed off, theyaposve barely been into the garden.Twenty two acres, a massive swimming pool, and they canapost step off the terrace to enjoy any of it. They say their young son, whose welfare is of the utmost concern to them, hasnapost left the building once.  And while theyaposve struggled to set up a new foundation and been embarrassed by revelations the last, pointless, one cost Princess Dianaaposs charity £, to set up, the monarchy they left behind has not put a foot wrong. The Queen has Zoomed. Anne marked her th with a documentary about her le that did not involve a single complaint. Charles recovered from Covid-, and avoided criticism for importing it to Scotland. Camilla has spoken out, forcefully, about domestic abuse. And Wills and Kate have had an absolute banger - bingo, baby banks, and a curry with Peter Crouch. The things they do and say are amplied by their status. And by wearing masks in public, Camilla and Kate have done more to protect and promote public health messaging than the entire Cabinet.Harry and Meghan delivered food parcels early on, but even George and Charlotte did that. The Sussexes have since concentrated on sucking lemons and delivering speeches, which has not had the same impact since they gave up the status which gave them a loudspeaker. Prince Andrew, of course, hasnapost gone away, and nor have the allegations about his friendship with a billionaire paedophile. But they have become repetitive, and with alleged pimp Ghislaine Maxwell under lock and key some of the heat is off him, for now.The monarchyaposs popularity, and its usefulness, are in robust health. Andrew is its only weakness, and heaposs been hidden away on the Royal estates which Harry and Meghan felt didnapost hide them enough.The Sussex machine, meanwhile, is graunching its gears. Itaposs shown all the grace and timing of Ann Widdecombe spinning on her bum across the Strictly dance floor. As millions struggle to survive, physically and financially, these two gave the thumbs-up to a book that cemented their petulance in the public mind. A long list of complaints about this girl and her baggage, the sacrices they made which few of us can see, the sensible advice they ignored, and the bruised egos of a couple who thought they would inherit Dianaaposs sainthood, without having to earn it or die for it. Despite being favourable to them, it even indicates they may have lied to the world about their engagement. And the Queen comes out of it looking like she has better manners than either of them. Letaposs be frank - without Royalty, the Royals are nothing. Just an expanding group of well-fed, over-privileged, people who would not be able to earn, represent good causes or holiday for free as they do now. What Harry and Meghan are learning, the hard way, is that applies to them, too. Their star power as Royals was immense - but outside the monarchy, it is waning. They have less protection, higher costs, and the same, stratospheric expectations of the good they can do and the le they will lead.And with the book, theyaposve just burned the one-year probation period negotiated before their departure. How can they ever appear on the balcony again, with the world knowing the details of a common family ruckus, in a family thataposs not supposed to be common  The Royals hate the goldfish bowl too, but they trade the state benefits for doing things useful to the state. They hobnob with whatever nobs the Prime Minister tells them to, co-ordinate their Press appearances, share out the charity work. Their continued existence as Royals, however right or wrong it may be, is strangely socialist, and protected by that of all the others. The Sussexes left the goldfish bowl, and found themselves in a shark tank. Their only friends will be friendless celebrities, the staff less loyal, the public more sceptical, and thereaposll not be a single person able, or authorised, to protect them from what will necessarily be a nakedly capitalist descent towards, inevitably, a line of vegan lingerie.And itaposs all a damned shame, because the day that Meghan walked herself down the aisle to marry a prince with little purpose, it seemed like they would do wonders for us and each other.Instead, they were unhappy, they left everyone  unhappy, and they seem to still be unhappy. Their future holds infinite further amounts of unhappiness, with court cases that, eventhey win, will air more dirty laundry than any sane person would want, and a le that will be lived undercover."},{"url":null,"title":"samsung galaxy note 20 series","story":"NewsSamsung Galaxy Note  launched - and its cheaper than the iPhone  ProThe new Galaxy Note  and Note  Ultra G phones will come with the series signature S Pen stylus built-in, with increased responsiveness to better mimic using a real pen and paperShareCommentsByJoseph WilkesReporter:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsThe new phones are here \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Oliver Crozier was running through the bushes near his home in Clovenstone, Edinburgh, when he was momentarily exposed to the plant. The weed has been sprouting across the UK, leaving kids with burns in north-west England, the West Midlands, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland, to name just a few. The invasive species has been dubbed Britainaposs most dangerous plant. Oliveraposs dad Scott, , thought it was sunburn when he saw Oliver’s leg the next day, but then blisters formed overnight. He said: “The blisters caused me concern because he has never had anything like that before. “He also had a blister on each wrist and one up on his inner thigh. “All the small blisters kind of got bigger and started forming larger blisters.” Scott took the lad to the AE at Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline, where his wounds were treated and medication was prescribed for the itch. He added: “The pictures then got emailed to his GP and they phoned saying they wanted him down to the surgery so they could pop the blisters and cut the flap of skin off as well.” Even though the exposure lasted only an instant, Scott said the skin took two weeks to heal. And for some it takes longer still.  One mum from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said she could still feel the burn even now after lting her two-year-old son away from a giant hogweed in late April. She said: “We were walking along the Bridgewater Canal and my son loves walking but he was tired and had a tantrum. “When he does this he throws himself on the floor – unfortunately on top of a young giant hogweed plant. “I picked him up thrashing about still… it wasn’t until the next day that I noticed the odd burn patches on both myself and my son. “At first I thought the sun cream had wiped off but then both the patches on myself and my son started to bubble.” The -year-old, who asked not to be named, urged other parents to be on their guard. She said: “Please don’t let your children go near it, and be vigilant – even a young plant can cause damage. “And take baby wipes everywhere with you!” "},{"url":null,"title":"hero dog saves dad iams","story":"AdvertorialDad milliseconds from death - but hero dog senses danger and drags him to safetySuper Schnauzer Betzi Boo realised something bad was about to happen and took actionShareByDave Masters:,  JUL Updated:,  AUG AdvertorialMark at the scene of the accident, which closed a busy road for hours\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Weekly #TeamDogSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The sentences are to be reviewed by the Attorney General, which Debbie Adlam said is the “right thing to do”. She added: “We walked out from court... feeling so let down. Andrew deserves so much better. “We can’t bring him back but we can hope there’s something... to give him the justice he deserves.” Henry Long, , and Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , were jailed for manslaughter for a crime the judge described as being “very close to murder in its seriousness”.

Cole and Bowers, the passengers at the time, were each jailed for  years, so they could be out in eight. Speaking about the killers’ joy in court at being convicted of manslaughter rather than murder, Debbie said: “That was very insulting. To see them jumping and celebrating was hard enough. They got away with it really. “But now hopefully the sentence can be increased to something that is a little more realistic for the crime that they’ve committed. “Losing Andrew has been above and beyond what we could even imagine. It’s knocked us sideways.” A spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office confirmed it has received a request for the jail terms to be looked at under the “unduly lenient” sentence scheme.

Miss Bunker was in a happy mood as she celebrated her th birthday with pals at Snobs nightclub in Birmingham after attending a performance by rapper Aitch. Mobile phone footage released by Staffordshire Police shows her and her killer Wesley Streete, , inside the city centre club, where she raises her hands in the air while dancing near her eventual killer and another pal. Streete, who was found guilty on Wednesday of rape and murder, is seen messing around with people seated nearby as he jumps close to them, extends his backside towards them and then laughs and points. Miss Bunker was walking home with her “trusted” childhood pal when he “forced himself on her sexually and strangled her in a park in Tamworth, Staffordshire, at around am on September  last year, the prosecution said. Just minutes earlier, aspiring schoolteacher Miss Bunker had told her best friend, Monique Riggon that she would be “safe” with Streete escorting her. He changed his story at least four times after he was arrested, initially telling Miss Bunker’s distraught family and police that they parted ways, and later claiming to jurors he accidentally killed her as they had sex in a park.He admitted dumping her body in a brook and covering her with branches at Wigginton Park, but insisted he did so in a panic. The jury rejected his lies as they found him guilty after a three-week trial. He ed to the site a number of times in the following hours to put more branches on Miss Bunkeraposs body. The barmaid, who had turned  just days earlier, was found dead that evening by her uncle, Jason Brown, after worried relatives, friends and police launched a search. Streete had met up with Miss Bunker after she and a friend had watched rapper Aitch perform at Birminghamaposs O Institute earlier that night.  The trio went clubbing in Birmingham city centre before taking a taxi back to Tamworth. Miss Bunkeraposs friend, Monique Riggon, offered her a bed at her home for the night, but Keeley declined, Stafford Crown Court heard. Miss Riggon tearfully told the court: “She said she was tired and wanted to go home. She would walk home with Wes. She said ‘I’ve got Wes, I’ll be fine, I’ll walk back with him, I’ll be safe’’.” The prosecution told the jury that Miss Bunker “trusted” Streete to get her home safe during the -minute walk from Miss Riggon’s home.  After she failed tohome, her family and friends became increasingly worried as she failed to answer her mobile phone and didnapost attend a job interview at a local infant school, which she had been excited about. Streete had lied to her worried dad Christopher, , who reported her missing to Staffordshire Police. Miss Bunker’s family and friends quizzed Streete, who insisted they had parted ways at a telephone box. However, he was later arrested. The court heard he changed his account at least four times between arrest and trial.  At one point he claimed Miss Bunker fell and hit her head on a gatepost, and he tried to massage her head and chest to save her. Giving evidence in court, he told the jury he accidentally killed Miss Bunker as they had sex in a park. He told the court: I put my arms around her neck and accidentally killed her. We were having sex. He admitted dumping her body in the brook and covering her with branches, but insisted he did so in a panic.  The jury heard he ed to the body quite a few times throughout the day to cover Miss Bunker with more branches. Streete also admitted to lying to Miss Bunker’s family, friends and police about what happened because he was scared and embarrassed. The prosecution said CCTV, mobile phone data and DNA all proved he was lying, with Miss Bunker’s blood, saliva and make-up found on his top. After her bag was found in the park, her uncle Mr Brown focused his search there and tragically discovered her body face-down in the brook.  He had spotted a “red object” and then hair as he moved closer to investigate. Mr Brown told the jury: Then I saw an arm with a bracelet. I knew what it was in front of me. I just started shouting ‘no’.” Dean Reynolds, an off-duty police officer who was nearby during the search, said in a statement that Mr Brownaposs agonising shouts were the most horrendous screaming I have heard in my le. Forensic pathologist Dr Brett Lockyer told the court a postmortem revealed Miss Bunker had injuries to her face and neck that were consistent with strangulation.

Mr Justice Warby said that both sides have been fighting a tit-for-tat PR battle outside the High Court courtroom. Todayaposs decision in the ongoing -month legal fight between the duchess and Associated Newspapers was a victory for Meghan, as the judge ruled that the identities of her five friends who spoke to a magazine should remain protected.But handing down his decision, Mr Justice Warby criticised both the claimant and the defendant. He wrote: It is... clear that neither side has, so far, been willing to confine the presentation of its case to the courtroom.Both sides have demonstrated an eagerness to play out the merits of their dispute in public, outside the courtroom, and primarily in media reports. Warning both sides he said: This will be a judge-alone trial, not a trial by jury. But to fight proceedings in court and through litigation PR or sensational reporting at one and the same time is not designed to enhance understanding of the legal process. For a party to file and immediately publicise prejudicial and partisan characterisations of the other’s litigation conduct in the media before a hearing certainly does not assist.  He said that the coverage has selectively highlighted aspects of the defendant’s case and features of the claimant’s case that are novel and interesting to the public. The focus is on sensational reporting of information that happens to be contained in the claimant’s statements of case. Meghan is suing the publisher of the Mail On Sunday and MailOnline over an article which reproduced parts of a private and confidential handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father Thomas Markle, , in August .  At a preliminary hearing in London last week, Meghanaposs lawyers applied for the five friends who gave an interview to People magazine to remain anonymous in reports of the proceedings. In a ruling on Wednesday, Mr Justice Warby said he had concluded that for the time being at least the duchess should be granted an order which protects the identities of the five iniduals. In the People article, published in February last year, the friends spoke out against the bullying Meghan said she has faced. They have only been identied in confidential court documents.  The duchess, , says her friends gave the interview without her knowledge, and denies a claim made by ANL that she caused or permitted the People article to be published. At a hearing last week, Meghanaposs lawyers argued that the friends - referred to as A to E - have a right to anonymity both as confidential journalistic sources and under their own privacy rights. In a ruling today, Mr Justice Warby said he had concluded that for the time being at least the duchess should be granted an injunction which protects the identities of the five iniduals. He described the ruling in favour of Meghan and her legal team as an “interim decision”. ANL won the first skirmish in the legal action on May , when Mr Justice Warby struck out parts of Meghanaposs claim, including allegations that the publisher acted dishonestly by leaving out certain passages of the letter.

Lissie Harper is calling for Andrewaposs Law, which would mean those convicted of causing the death of police, fire or emergency medical workers would spend the rest of their le in prison. The couple were married for just four weeks before her husband was killed. PC Harperaposs mother Debbie Adlam is also backing the campaign and said that something needs to change after the thugs who killed her son were handed sentences that could see them spend as little as eight years in jail. Lissie said: I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference that this country clearly needs. I vow to stand strong and firm with so many other honourable people in our country to make the changes that we clearly know to be justied. The campaign is being backed by the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents thousands of officers up to the rank of chief inspector. PC Harper was killed as he tried to stop three thieves fleeing after they stole a quad bike from a remote house in Stanford Dingley, Berkshire, on August  last year. Henry Long, , and -year-olds Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers were jailed for the -year-old newlywedaposs manslaughter after they were cleared of murder. Long, who drove the car that dragged PC Harper to his death, was sentenced to  years, meaning he may be out in less than .  Cole and Bowers, the passengers at the time, were each jailed for  years, so they could be out in eight. But the terms could be increased after they were referred to the Attorney General for review. PC Harper was on duty when he was caught in a strap and dragged for a mile behind Longaposs car after trying to stop the gang. Long swerved violently at speeds of up to mph. PC Andrew Harperaposs mother is backing the campaign to ensure all police killers serve at least  years in jail. Heartbroken Debbie, , is calling for a minimum term for all of those who take the le of an officer with “no parole, no reductions”. She said: We want to bring in something called Andrewaposs Law - we want to change this so that you are sentenced to a proper amount of time and that defines the crime that youaposve committed. Weaposre hoping for a mandatory sentence with no early release, no reductions for being a certain age. Youaposve killed somebody who is out there to do a good job, to protect the country, and you have taken their le. You need to pay for that.

Parts of the country will be hotter than top holiday destinations in the Caribbean, including the Bahamas, Jamaica and Barbados. The sweltering temperatures are expected to continue until Sunday and are the result of hot air moving in from southern Europe. It means Britain could pass the threshold for a heatwave, which requires three days of temperatures over C across most of the nation and C in London. Temperatures in London and the south east on Friday may even surpass the .C recorded in Heathrow on July  - the hottest day of the year so far, and the UKaposs third warmest ever. Met Office forecaster Oli Claydon said: Thereaposs a strong likelihood London and the south east could see a heatwave this week, with four or even five consecutive days of incredibly warm temperatures reaching a high of C on Friday.It is the result of southerly winds moving from Europe and parts of northern Africa, which will push the temperatures up. Thursday is expected to begin overcast for most of the country, but will be a dry day for all, with the sun appearing through the clouds by the afternoon and temperatures pushing to C in the capital. However, rain is expected in the north west of Scotland and Northern Ireland on Friday, with highs of C. Wales and the north and south-west of England will be sunny, with temperatures reaching around C. Mr Claydon added: Saturday will likely be another hot day for southern and central parts of the UK, with heatwave conditions potentially continuing in parts of southern and south-east England.  Sunday should be the last of the heatwave conditions, before cold air moves in overnight leading to some thundery showers on Monday. UK  day weather forecast Today: Rather cloudy with outbreaks of rain moving east across central and northern Britain. This heavy at times over Wales, the Midlands and northern England. Sunny spells developing across southeast where it will be very warm Tonight: Outbreaks of rain and drizzle will gradually fade. Rather cloudy with some mist and low cloud. Feeling humid in south.

Paulo Dos Santos the Brazilian acro-bat is flipping his ft ins frame around the ring and the aerial artists are hanging about high on pre-show excitement. I, however, am standing against a white board gouged with deep blade marks, trying to stop myself shaking. “It’s important you don’t move,” says Toni Novoltini, the High Speed Kne Thrower from the Czech Republic, stating the bleedin’ obvious. “My we is my usual assistant and I’ve never hit her – but I did pin her dress to the board once.” Before I can askhe has practised much recently, a huge metal kne whistles past my face close enough to trim my eyebrows. Six more thud into the target and, as I check my limbs are intact, a huge cheer goes up from the assembled ensemble. I have passed my in-tents audition for Zippos Circus, the spectacular family show that is finally back in action after four months of corona lockdown. The big top is up again on Southsea Common, in Hampshire, ahead of a nationwide tour, and the -strong community have been working flat out to make things safe. As circuses are classed as outdoor venues they have now been allowed to reopen ahead of theatres. So, roll up, roll up, ladies, gentlemen and children and take your socially-distanced seats for the greatest covid-compliant show on earth.  “We are absolutely thrilled to be back,” says founder and director Martin Burton, aka Zippo the Clown. “We are calling this the Rebound Tour as we’re determined to bounce back to our brilliant best. “We’ve had to comply with stringent social distance and safety regulations but I’m confident our big top is now safer than my own home.” Rows of seats have been removed but families and households can sit in bubbles and, as seats all face forward, the wearing of masks is voluntary. But juggling safety concerns mean Martin and his we Julia are inevitably walking a commercial tightrope. He says: “We’re going to take a big hit. We usually seat , but now it’ll be .  Then there’s the expense of hand-sanitiser stations, PPE and the ‘deep-fogging’ machine we’ll use to disinfect between performances. “But everyone is just relieved and delighted to get back to work.” During lockdown the  artists –many from overseas and working on contracts – faced a tricky balancing act to make ends meet. Martin and Julia provided a safety net by allowing them to live at their winter quarters in Newbury, Berks. But circus folk aren’t used to sitting around doing nothing so, visas permitting, they found other jobs. The Kenyan tumblers became care-home assistants, a juggler and her family did night shts in a chicken factory and other performers worked as drivers.  “That’s the circus work ethic,” says Julia. “But our Mongolian acrobats didn’t speak English and couldn’t find jobs – so local charities helped raise the money to get them home.” Even the Ringmistress went to work in a meat-packing factory. Tracy Jones, , from Oswestry, North Wales, is the circus’s first female in the role. She is covering for veteran star Norman Barrett MBE who, at , is still shielding at home with his famous performing budgies. At  Tracy got a summer job as a stunt rider’s assistant then ran away to join the circus as a bareback rider, trapeze artist and snake performer. “I’d try anything,” she says. “My mum was mortied when I packed my bags but I just had to do it. “It’s the sense of community and the audience’s excitement. That’s why we’re so thrilled to be back. It’s not a job but a way of le. You get the bug.” But now, as well as compering, Tracy has a responsibility to keep the performers and audience safe from coronavirus.Sadly, that means no more audience participation – something that has hit the show’s French clown Emilion especially hard. “He had brilliant routines involving audience members,” says Julia. “Kids love to see their parents being dragged up. But it’s just not possible now. There are also no panto-style, ‘He’s behind you!’ routines either because of the risk of aerosol emissions. But gasping should be OK. That’s the usual reaction to the staggering first-half finale, which sees the Lucius Team of daredevil Brazilian motorbike riders hurtling round a metal cage at mph.  Although Martin is thinking of changing the Globe of Death’s name to the Globe of Speed… in case anyone is offended after the pandemic. “The perform-ers can’t line up at the end and shake hands or pose for photos,” he says. “It’s sad but it’s just the new normal and we are used to adapting. The show will still be absolutely amazing.” It turns out Emilion isn’t too down in the mouth – because today’s clowns don’t wear thick make-up any more. “That’s because of the whole killer clown nonsense,” tuts Martin who is president of Clowns International. “You can’t risk scaring the kids. Clowns got hijacked from comedy into horror, thanks to Stephen King. It’s really not funny but what can you do ” Circus people are superstitious folk. Green is rarely seen, you shouldn’t sit with your back to the ring and there must be no whistling or peacock feathers in the big top.

When the dispute turned ugly Crystal moved from Connecticut to Michigan in the US - where state law meant she could be recognised as Seraphinaaposs legal parent. The little girl was born with a rare condition called heterotaxy syndrome, which meant internal organs such as her stomach and liver were in the wrong place.

Rene said: She had the most confident, self-assured personality, and she told everyone what to do. In her letime she underwent three major heart surgeries and a number of minor procedures. Seraphina died after complications following necessary surgery, her family said. In a heartwarming obituary, her loved ones wrote: Seraphina’s larger than le personality only grew throughout her le, and you never had to guess what she was thinking or feeling.At least once a day, someone would snuggle up to her and repeat the Seraphina family motto: aposFor a girl who can’t talk, you sure are never quiet!apos She couldn’t walk by herself, but she persisted in turning everyone in the house into her personal mobility assistants.

Claire Malleson, from Dorset, has been working for the American University in the city for two years and was on the campus at the time. She told the PA news agency: I just felt this enormous explosion - I thought it was somewhere on campus because it felt a lot closer than the three miles away. I could see damage to the buildings near me and a glowing red cloud and a plume of smoke. I couldnapost really move, I was rooted to the spot. My first thought was to go to a phone and call my parents, in case they saw a newsflash. I found my way back to one of the campus apartments. Everyone was walking in a daze. As soon as I got near the campus housing buildings, I could see there was panic. Everyone was saying they felt earthquake-like shakings and buildings had been shaking before the explosion. The Foreign Office has said that Embassy staff were injured in the blast. None of the injuries suffered were le-threatening. An FCO spokesman said: “All Embassy staff are accounted for. A small number have sustained non- le-threatening injuries and where necessary are receiving medical attention.”  Asked how many British nationals had been affected, the FCO said: “It is a fast moving situation and we are monitoring the situation closely. We stand ready to offer consular support to British nationals affected. “People should check FCO Travel Advice which is updated regularly, and includes contact details for those requiring consular assistance.” "},{"url":null,"title":"beirut explosion hero nurse saves","story":"NewsBeirut explosion: Hero nurse saves three newborn babies as blast rocks hospitalWARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: A viral photo shows the nurse crading the three infants in her arms in a reception area \"surrounded by dozens of bodies and wounded\" at Beiruts Saint George HospitalShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video doctors-treat-patients-hospital-car-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news beirut-explosion-hero-nurse-saves-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The woman is wearing blue scrubs and a protective face mask, due to the coronavirus pandemic, in the snap taken by photographer Bilal Marie Jawish at the Lebanese capitalaposs Saint George Hospital University Medical Center.The photographer wrote on Facebook that he has covered lots of wars but he had never witnessed anything like the Beirut blast - and the hero nurse - before.Have you been affected by the explosion  Email webnews@mirror He wrote:  years of press photography and lots of wars. I can say I didnapost see what I saw today in Ashrafia area, especially in front of the rum hospital and this aposheroineapos caught me inside the hospital and was accelerating to call despite the suspension of communication holding three newborn babies and surrounded by dozens of bodies and wounded. The explosion killed four nurses and injured about  patients, visitors and staff as it left the hospital non-operational. It suffered signicant damage and was without electricity in the hours after the explosion, which killed about  people, injured about , more and left dozens missing.  There were so many patients that doctors and nurses had to treat people in a car park outside after shattered glass and debris was cleared. The Lebanese Red Cross sent teams to transport patients to other hospitals.A doctor at the scene told Al Arabiya English: “We’re bringing the patients to the emergency building, and from there, we’re trying to send them to dferent hospitals because the urgent care is also full. What can we do ”Sleiman Haroun, head of the Syndicate of Hospitals in Lebanon, said mass injuries occurring amid the Covid- pandemic was“catastrophic. Hospitals were so overwhelmed that the walking wounded were turned away so medics could focus on those with le-threatening or more serious injuries.One local report claimed hospital morgues were full of bodies after the explosion occurred amid the coronavirus pandemic. There was an appeal for blood donations as stocks were depleted in the aftermath of the disaster. The explosion is thought to have been triggered by a fire that was sparked by a welder, according to local media. More than , tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, exploded in a warehouse where it had been stored without safety measures for six years, according to officials. As teams searched the rubble for survivors and bodies, photos from the blast site showed apocalyptic scenes with a massive crater and buildings flattened by a blast that is said to have had a fth of the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb.A preliminary investigation revealed Tuesdayaposs blast occurred after a fire was sparked by someone welding a small hole to prevent theft from the warehouse, the Lebanese TV station LBCI reported. A security source told Reuters it was started by welding work being carried out on a hole in the warehouse located in the Port of Beirut. Video posted on social media showed slashes and pops as the fire raged just moments before the explosion sent a shockwave through the city on the Mediterranean, leading to speculation the blast occurred at a fireworks storage site. Badri Daher, director general of Lebanese Customs, said it appears fireworks were being stored close to the ammonium nitrate. The explosive material was seized from a ship in . A shockwave that obliterated buildings and knocked people off their feet was felt as far away as Cyprus, some  miles from the blast site.  What we are witnessing is a huge catastrophe, the head of Lebanonaposs Red Cross George Kettani told broadcaster Mayadeen. There are victims and casualties everywhere. Prime Minister Hassan Diab promised there would be accountability for the deadly blast at the dangerous warehouse, adding those responsible will pay the price. A number of British nationals, including embassy staff and journalists, were caught up in the disaster, with a small number suffering non-le-threatening injuries. Schools minister Nick Gibb told Sky News all embassy staff based in Beirut are accounted for.Mr Gibb added that we donapost know yet how many British nationals are affected and that the Prime Minister of Lebanon has asked for assistance. Dozens of people are feared to be missing and the death toll is expected to rise as search and rescue teams look for victims buried under twisted metal and debris from buildings. Dazed, weeping and injured people walked through streets searching for relatives.  Worried residents have been posting photos of the missing on social media as part of desperate efforts to find them. An Instagram account created after the blast now has dozens of appeals and more than , followers.There are many people missing. People are asking the emergency department about their loved ones and it is dficult to search at night because there is no electricity, Health Minister Hamad Hasan told Reuters. A number of countries have promised to send aid to Lebanon as thousands of residents were left homeless or forced to sleep in high-rise flats that suffered signicant damage. Business Secretary Alok Sharma confirmed the UK Government is working to send a package of support."},{"url":null,"title":"brits cancel holidays cyprus due","story":"NewsBrits cancel their holidays to Cyprus due to nightmare entry requirementsHolidaymakers set to travel to Cyrpus this summer have cancelled their holidays due to the expensive coronavirus tests required for people entering from the UKShareCommentsByRosaleen FentonExclusives Reporter:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsMany people have cancelled their holiday \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

On August , Cyprus reported just  new cases with the number of overall cases standing at ,. The popular holiday destination has recorded just  deaths after it locked down swtly. Travellers must also complete a Cyprus Flight Pass before travelling which must have your PCR test result uploaded within  hours of your departure. The popular holiday destination has welcomed UK tourists since August , as it upgraded the country from category C. As a category B country, all travellers from the UK must provided a negative test. People coming from category A countries can enter Cyprus freely, whilst holidaymakers in category C cannot visit at all. The tough restrictions are having an impact on bookings.  Noel Josephides, owner of Sunvil Travel, said lots of holidays are being cancelled. He told the Cyprus Mail : “We had people booking trips to Cyprus in the past months but almost all of them have cancelled their plans.“In fact, we have close to zero new bookings for this summer. For Britons with family and children, the tests and forms that need to be completed are a nightmare.” Travel agent Harry Kyrillou, who owns Planet Holidays, said he had no bookings for Cyprus last month. “Cyprus has opened up to British tourists only in theory,” he added. “Realistically, the entry requirements demanded to British tourists scare them away.

So the idea of anyone causing harm or distress to a cute little pup is incredibly upsetting.But one family did just this to their dog, throwing the elderly animal out like rubbish when they decided to move house.The poor unwanted pooch, named Athena, was left tied up by a deserted café in Nikolaevka, Bulgaria, abandoned by those she loved most.To make matters worse, the cruel owners had also put a heavy chain around the dogaposs neck, meaning she was unable to go very far to find food or water. According to Paws  Hope, who shared her heartbreaking story, Athena survived off of scraps she was given by truck drivers who occasionally drove by her.Unsurprisingly she became extremely malnourished and her fur was soon riddled with fleas and ticks. Tragically while she was chained up, she also lost the sight in one of her eyes. However her sad story does in fact have a happy ending!  Laurica Nagel, who worked as a volunteer for a dog rescue organisation, heard a story about a dog tied up in the middle of nowhere and went to investigate. She found Athena and was horried as she took in the depressing scene before her. The dog was immediately taken for medical help and given food and drink as well as a much needed bath. Soon she recovered and it came time to find her a new, loving, place to live.

It’s been a long time coming. I can’t wait to get started and meet all the boys.“Now I’m here I want to prove to the manager and prove to the team I can help the club get where they want to be.“I know the league well, I’ve done well in the league before and I can see myself doing well at a club like this. It’s a massive club and the players here are top quality so I’m really forward to getting going.”The -year-old came very close to joining James McPake’s men back in January, only for time to run out at the end of the transfer window.And he says knowing the Dens boss has been an admirer for some time helped make the decision to sign up for the Dee six months later.He added: “It was really close, just didn’t quite work out, but I’m here now and happy to be here.“I think it’s half the battle being at a club that the manager likes you.”Mullen, who will wear the number nine jersey, will already have won over some fans after his play-off goal helped keep the Buddies in the Premiership at the end of season - at the expense of local rivals Dundee United.Meanwhile, former Dens loan ace Christophe Berra insists he is ready to revive his Hearts career after being unceremoniously axed by former boss Daniel Stendel.Berra, , remains baffled by the German’s decision to strip him of the captaincy and farm him out on loan to Dundee in January, emphasising that he was willing to fight for his place.He was excellent for James McPake’s side, who kept five clean sheets in six games featuring the veteran stopper.But Berra will go up against Dee with the Jambos in the Championship this season after reporting back for duty following the shutdown with renewed confidence.The defender, who is contracted to Hearts until next summer, is determined to battle his way into the plans of ing head coach Robbie Neilson, his ex-Tynecastle team-mate, and prove that age is no barrier.Reflecting on his enforced exile, Berra told the BBC: “I could understandI was a bad egg but I’m not.“I was happy to stay and fight for my place but the manager came in and you’ve got to respect his decision.“I went to Dundee and, looking back, that was a great thing for me. I played in six games, undefeated, kept five clean sheets and enjoyed my football.“I know I can still play at a good level. I don’t care about age #you are learning every day, putting in the sht and performing well then you can play far beyond your years.“I’ll do my utmost in training and, come the first game of the season,the manager decides to pick me, then great.“There are no guarantees in football no matter who you are. It’ll be down to me, in terms of how I perform in training and pre-season games.”Dundee and Hearts go head to head at Tynecastle on October , the Championship’s opening day, and Berra acknowledges the capital club are favourites for the title.However, he warned against anything approaching complacency.Berra added: “We have expectations as a club and, there’s not point hiding it, everyone expects us to go up.#We’re the hot favourites but in football, and sport in general, you need to earn the right to go up.“Every team we play against will be trying their hardest # and there are good teams down there good players.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Cycling has become ever more popular during lockdown and swimming in rivers and lakes is another wonderful way to get the blood pumping and improve your health. A survey taken at the start of lockdown revealed that one in four of us admitted that we were more active than before lockdown.This increased to one in three as lockdown continued, with combatting lockdown weight gain and helping mental health given as the top reasons many people are turning to some form of physical exercise.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

to provide additional space for physical distancing to protect public health, work has started on a temporary cycle route between Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton which will run parallel to the main B Edinburgh Road.The three-metre wide path will be created by laying hard surfacing down on the grass verge on the north side of the carriageway between the two communities.The path will run alongside the footpath between the boatyard access at Prestonpans to just past the old power station with a white line separating the cyclepath and walkway.This is the councilrsquos latest project to improvesocial distancing in the wake of the Covid- crisis.The local authority received pound.million from the Scottish Governmentrsquos Spaces for People fund to introduce ious countywide measures to make it easier to social distance in town centres and improve cycle and pedestrian paths.As well as the roadside cycle route, the speed limit on Edinburgh Road, which is normally mph, will be reduced to mph and speed limits in the twocommunities reduced to just mph.The plan for the cycle path has seen dozens of painted stones created by local schoolchildren, which line the footpath, move across to the other side of the road.The stones are a symbol of hope and unity during the Covid- crisis, and many similar displays have been created throughout East Lothian and the whole country.Councillor Norman Hampshire, environment spokesperson at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe received many comments in the public consultation around Spaces for People on the need to provide suitable space for people cycling.ldquoMany people are currently cycling this route and we need to cater for the current increase in cyclists during the pandemic period.ldquoIn common with other Spaces for People measures, this route is for temporary use as we gradually move out of restrictions and will also provide a viable alternative to the use of the private car and or public transport for shorter-distanced essential or leisure trips in the area.The works also include the introduction of temporary crossings of Edinburgh Road at either end of the route through the use of lsquobuildoutsrsquo and bolt-down bollards.In addition, the proposals also include traffic calming measures on Edinburgh Road to slow down traffic with a temporary reduction in the speed limit to mph between the two communities, in tandem with the introduction of mph limits within the communities themselves.MrHampshire added: ldquoWe were aware of a collection of painted stones that have been carefully laid by local schoolchildren alongside the existing footway along Edinburgh Road and recognise that these are important to the local community.ldquoThe community council arranged for these to be carefully collected prior to the start of the works and they have been relocated on the other side of the road."},{"url":null,"title":"pans-snake-slithers-across-road-new-home","story":"The Pans

I was hooked straight away by the topics writer and broadcaster Emma Gannon covers in Olive, her first foray into fiction particularly, how its still a taboo for a woman to say she doesnt want children. The story follows the eponymous character and her three best friends, Isla, Cecily and Bea. Moving between their s and present-day - as they navigate their early s - we see how their lives have taken very dferent paths. Gannons characters feel comfortingly familiar, and their ious struggles many women will be able to identy with. I loved the exploration of how messy friendships can get, and how much warmth, empathy, and understanding Gannon displays throughout. My only criticism would be some plot developments felt a little rushed, the writing a little hurried. However, that doesnt take away from how enjoyable it is the fact I devoured it in one weekend says it all.GEORGIA HUMPHRIESIf I Had Your Face  by Frances Cha is published in paperback by Viking, priced pound. .If I Had Your Face is the debut novel from Frances Cha, which follows four women who live in the same apartment block in Seoul, South Korea. All of them placing unrealistic expectations of beauty, success and romance upon themselves. Plastic surgery devotee, Kyuri, works as a room salon girl where she entertains the ludicrously wealthy men of the city, Miho is an artist with connections to the upper echelons of Korean society, K-Pop obsessed mute, Ara, is a hairdresser and their pregnant neighbour, while Wonna, is stuck in an uninspiring and underpaid office job with fears over how she will afford to be a mother. Each chapter alternates between the four protagonists, told in the first person, the trouble is I had a hard time distinguishing whose voice I was hearing. All of them are struggling to get by in modern day Korea a place where birth, marriage and unemployment rates are at an all-time low. They are looking for a le as far away from their disadvantaged beginnings as possible and the s they are willing to go to achieve that are ruthless. The book ends a little prematurely and with multiple loose ends left hanging. Ultimately, this is an entertaining book you wont struggle to get through, but it might leave you feeling slightly unsatisfied.FRANCES WRIGHTThe Hungover Games by Sophie Heawood is published in hardback by Jonathan Cape, priced pound. Unexpectedly pregnant in Los Angeles, where she has been living in a bubble as a celebrity journalist, Sophie Heawood s to the UK to have the baby she had not planned for. What follows next is a frank memoir about shedding ones old le to nurture another, trying to date and hold down a freelance career while bringing up a newborn, with a few big-name interviews thrown in along the way. The brutal precision in which she describes prolonged singledom is so accurate it leaves the reader winded the love for her daughter, sublime. This is in turns gorgeous, unflinching, tender, sad, affirming and cackle-worthy. You dont need to be a mother, have one in your le or hope to become one, for the razor-sharp observations chronicled here to ring true.JEMMA CREWChildrens book of the weekThe Wild Way Home by Sophie Kirtley is published in hardback by Bloomsbury Childrens Books, priced pound. Sophie Kirtleys debut is a thoughtful and gentle musing on how to cope with change, and control the feeling of fear when it floods your system. Its Charlie Merriams th birthday, and his new little brother Dara has just arrived, but the baby is poorly, and Charlie doesnt know how to love him just yet. So, Charlie runs away to the forest, where he and his friends have built a whole world of their own. Except this time, the forest feels and looks dferent - and then Charlie finds a boy in animal skins face down in a stream. There are broad echoes of David Almonds Kits Wilderness, but The Wild Way Home is not so darkly complex and tangled. Charlies adventures lack a certain amount of peril, while the lives of those he encounters in this ancient version of his forest could do with more fleshing out. However, its a solid story about facing what terries you, feeling your feelingsand protecting the ones you love. Plus, it will make you desperate to get out into the forest.ELLA WALKER"},{"url":null,"title":"tv-preview-sensual-moving-daring-little-birds-feels-different-anything-else-tv","story":"\"They really affected me, and woke a sexual sort of fire that I didnt know I had\",\" notes the London-born star, who grew up in Somerset, and has been acting since she was a young teenager.Now,  years later, the quirky actress is playing the lead role - New York heiress Lucy Savage - in Sky Atlantics adaptation of Nins book.\"I made a lot of notes of little things that I wanted to add into the script, trying to get actual one-liner direct quotes from Little Birds, and I got a couple of them in there, which was really exciting,\" reflects Temple, star of films such as Atonement, St Trinians and Maleficent, plus Netflix series Dirty John.\"That was cool that everyone was open to me doing that.\"Little Birds is a six-part series, written by Sophia Al-Maria - an American-Qatari filmmaker and artist - and directed by Detroit-born Stacie Passon, whose previous projects include House Of Cards.When her husband Hugo does not greet her in the way she expected, she finds herself on a journey to freedom and independence.We see Lucy discovering the surprising, erse and degenerate world of Tangier, in Morocco, a country quivering on the cusp of independence. Along the way, she meets a myriad of characters including a scandalous dominatrix, Chera Lamorwho particularly captures Lucys imagination.Seeing as the show is based on a volume of erotica, you can expect to see some bold sex scenes on screen, which look they could be quite awkward to film.Was there anything the cast drew a line under when it came to depicting characters in intimate situations \"I was very clear from the very beginning of what is allowed and what is not allowed,\" declares Marwan, who was born in Lebanon, but grew up in Beirut and then Iowa.\"Im still scared to this day, to right this second, for when Little Birds comes out, how many family members Im going to lose.\"It sounds like Marwan being quite jokey at first, but then she stresses: \"Its funny, but its not funny even though I made sure that I would never show my breasts or my ass or I would never be in a scene where Im having sex, its still like I did too much for what my family would expect from me.\"The production [team], the director, were very, very understanding... It just felt like any boundary that the actor would set during the scene was accepted immediately, which made me comfortable to be able to do the scene.\"\"Stacie has been quite attentive to any conversation we would want to have with her, related to any intimate scenes,\" follows Raphael Acloque, who portrays an Egyptian aristocrat named Adham Abaza.\"She was always available, whenever we needed to discuss anything about it.\"Hugh Skinner - known for shows such as Fleabag and WA - plays Hugo, who is not only trapped in a relationship with Lucy, who he doesnt love, but we also see trying to become an arms dealer.\"Its so hard because when you put it like that, he sounds dreadful,\" quips London native Skinner, .\"But there are a lot of external forces weighing down on him and, in that sense, hes a bit of an emotionally stunted pinball.\"But despite being gay and deciding to marry a woman, hes really lucked out with Lucy actually because she proves to be incredible.\"All the characters, theyre all sort of outsiders in a lot of ways, taking ownership of their otherness and transcending the situation, and hes lucky to be with Lucy as she finds liberation.\"This may be a period drama, but theres no denying that the themes will resonate with modern audiences.For example, the idea of people being desperate to shake off the shackles of society still very much exists today, I suggest.\"Yeah, I think power struggles will always exist and I think this show is all about people fighting for their own agency, or struggling for their own independence whether thats personally, or politically, thats always going to be relevant,\" -year-old Nina Sosanya, who plays eccentric entertainer Lili Von X, nods in agreement.\"Its going to have a wide audience, because its set in a particular period, but its a period thats incredibly attractive to us anyway, just visually,\" continues the Londoner, who starred alongside Skinner in WA, and is also known for BBC One drama Last Tango In Halax.\"And youre going to have people that have lived through those changes - a section of the audience that might sometimes be overlooked, which is the people that are older than us, -plus who have actually seen those changes, who have lived through the sexual revolution of the s... This is going to be very interesting for them.\"The show was shot in Tara in Spain, as well in Manchester.While on location, did the cast have any particularly memorable cast nights out after filming had finished for the day \"When wasnt there one !\" Temple quickly replies, grinning.\"Lots of dinners, lots of conversations, lots of laughter, lots of tears, lots of screaming, lots of hugging. It was great. It was also just an incredible learning experience.\"\"I always say that I am always surprised by how much we liked each other because Ive done so many projects with people that I absolutely hated,\" Marwan follows candidly.\"At the end of the day, its a job. But something about this felt dferent... This felt like a very, very special project where, for some reason, most of us felt very connected to each other.\"There was something about just all of us being there together that helped me a lot during the process of filming.\"\"Which makes it extra cruel we have to be doing press for this via Zoom, because of a pandemic!\" cries Temple. \"It really would be nice to be together to do this for real.\"Little Birds launches on Sky Atlantic on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"five-best-new-cars-towing-caravan","story":"Whether its a caravan, boat or trailer ndash or anything  in-between ndash having the right car for the job is essential when it comes to towing.Here, weve taken into account the maximum braked trailer towing capacity. However, always check both the kerbweight of the car youre using to tow with, as well as the weight of the caravan. For safe towing, its usually recommended to only pull a caravan which weighs % of the tow cars total kerbweight. Be extremely carefultowing a caravan which exceeds this % rule.Weve been through the latest models, to see which cars are the very best for towing. Lets take a look.... Volvo XC DVolvos stylish XC won the Towcar of the Year award for , so its only fitting that it kicks this list off. Capable of towing up to ,kg of braked trailer, the XC is just as practical as it is good-looking.An optional retractable towbar means you dont need to disturb the cars clean lines when youre not hauling, while the interiors solid fit and finish should mean its up to the task for any adventure. It isnt overly large either, which means that when not towing, its relatively easy to park and position.. Volkswagen TouaregThe Volkswagen Touareg is a big, luxurious, high-riding SUV, which is capable of wolfing up hundreds of miles without a moments hesitation. It also - handily enough for this list - is excellent at towing.Its able to tow up to ,kg of braked trailer, and a silky-smooth turbocharged six-cylinder diesel engine makes it a refined way of getting about.. Jaguar I-PaceIf youre looking to tow, then an electric vehicle might not immediately spring to mind. However, Jaguars I-Pace was designed to be capable of towing from the off, putting it in line with the firms go-anywhere mentality.As a result, itll tow up to kg. Well admit that its certainly on the lighter end of the scale, but its still admirable from an EV.. Skoda KodiaqThe Kodiaq is an excellent, well-valued choice in the seven-seater segment. Not only is it immensely practical but its also well priced, packing plenty of on-board technology and a vast suite of standard equipment.Plus, a .-litre turbocharged engine helps the Kodiaq to deliver a braked towing capacity of ,kg. Despite this load-lugging ability, the Kodiaq CO emissions are impressively low - just g km.. Land Rover DiscoveryThe Land Rover Discovery is a mammoth of the road, providing a luxurious, high-end driving experience for all on board. Its also packed with off-road technology and a iety of features which help it to keep going even when things get tough.Its impressive when it comes to towing too, thanks to a braked trailer rating of up to ,kg - which means its got more than enough pulling power for most occasions.Jack Evans"},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  The unanswerable question for every Scottish Tory leader","story":"Few voters outside Moray know who Douglas Ross is. Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seemingly without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them. They are shackled to a UK party that appears to revel in acting against the best interests of Scotland.Those most committed to the Union will still cast their votes for the party next May. They have nowhere  to go.But polls over the last few months have detected a sht. The size of this steadfastly pro-Union group looks like it is decreasing, largely due to Brexit. Younger voters remain overwhelmingly in support of independence.In a bid to counter this, Mr Ross refers throughout the aforementioned article to patriotism, a term associated with the sort of brash Brexiteers most in Scotland canrsquot stand, and is surely no less problematic than ldquonationalism.The architects of his campaign - among them Michael Gove - have little choice but to focus on ldquosaving the Union. But how do you even begin to do this when your own party works against you at every turn  That remains the enduring, unanswerable question for whoever leads the Scottish Tories."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-old-ones-worst","story":"ACH, well.

Therersquos two big reasons TikTok has achieved the whirlwind success it has in an already busy field: Firstly, TiKTok provides a suite of surprisingly capable video-editing tools, free of charge on your mobile phone. You can create, edit and mody videos up to  seconds long, as well as add on popular music, songs and audio from a large library of recordings. Popular genres include comedy sketches, dance routines, make up, and fitness, alongside all sorts of other niche content creators.Secondly, it acts as a social media  by sharing usersrsquo videos to each other. Over time, the  develops an understanding of what sort of content each user enjoys, and creates a curated ldquoFor You page full of videos it thinks yoursquoll like. While most users are unlikely to reach a wide audience, successful creators can go viral and become ldquoTikTok famous. It may seem a little complicated but my -year-old sister insists itrsquos really quite simple.So why has it been so controversial TikTok stands accused of mistreating its underage users: fostering addiction, damaging attention spans, and failing to protect children from cyberbullying and inappropriate messages from adults. In February  the  was fined over M by the US FTC for collecting data on users under . Since then, the UK Information Commissionerrsquos Office have opened an investigation, alleging that the app fails to adequately protect children.Last November, TikTok admitted that it suppressed the content of disabled, ugly, deprived and LGBT users, allegedly in an effort to cut down on cyberbullying. Most damaging of all accusations has been that the app is influenced by the Chinese government.So is TikTok owned by China Itrsquos complicated. Ostensibly, ByteDanceis a private company based in mainland China. In reality, however, the Chinese Communist Party maintains a management committee over ByteDance and collaborates with it on CCP initiatives, blurring the line between the state and private sector in typical Chinese fashion. TikTok has been repeatedly accused of assisting the Chinese state by suppressing information about Chinese human rights violations, the Uighur genocide and the ongoing repression in Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as well as promoting pro-CCP propaganda.Worst of all, the app has been charged with passing along personal, biometric and location data to Chinese intelligence services, an allegation the company strongly denies.

But it was just that sense of familiarity that was oh-so welcome.I would have happily handed over my pay-per-view fee to have Scottish football back on my TVI wasnrsquot in a position to go along to a game too.And going by the reaction of supporters on social media, screenings from across the country seemed to go down without any major hiccups.Of course there are going to be teething problems and it will probably take some of Scotlandrsquos top flight teams a few weeks before they are churning out industry standard streams ndash but remember these are unprecedented times for everyone.I have to tip my hat to Dundee United too. The Terrors were extremely well organised and made a potentially nerve wracking experience stress free for those of us who were lucky enough to take in their first game back in the Premiership.They would have loved the stands to be full of adoring supporters for the unfurling of the Championship winners flag, but with the stadium decorated in tangerine flags and supporter cutouts, they certainly made the best out of a bad situation.As much as it was great to be back at a live game, the lack of fans was the one big disappointment and I believe it certainly had an impact on those out on the pitch.United played against the  men of St Johnstone for the best part of  minutes on Saturday and threatened Elliott Parish in the Saints goal only once.If the stands had been packed with Tannadice followers urging their team on to attack, it could have quite easily been an opening day three points for Micky Mellonrsquos side.Therersquos talk of it being September before supporters are able toto their seats in stadiums across Scotland, albeit in reduced numbers.In my opinion this stage, with empty stadia, could have both positive and negative effects on teams.Dundee United, as previously mentioned, are a prime example of the way a lack of supporters can have a negative impact.But for a team like Rangers, I think an empty Ibrox for the opening period of the season could work as an advantage.Nobody can disagree that it takes a special player to perform week in week out in front of , and in recent seasons some Gers players have been guilty of finding that pressure too much.In contrast, having no one in the stands, players can focus fully on the job in hand ndash getting three points on the board week in week out.Consistency will grow confidence and when the time comes for supporters to make their way back through the Ibrox turnstiles, players should not find the weight of expectancy as heavy as usual.Only time will tellsupporter absence will play a key role in deciding where the title ends up this season, but letrsquos just take a minute to appreciate that our game is back.The league we love and adore, the teams we, in normal circumstances, would follow across the country every week are back on our screens.There was pressure on the Scottish game last weekend to get it right after a summer of squabbling between clubs and the SPFL about how the season was ended.It featured on our televisions and computer screens almost as much as the pandemic we are experiencing.But again I will reiterate, nobody has experienced anything like this before and cut-throat decisions had to be made.Those at the top got it right at the weekend and we must continue to showcase football in Scotland in the best possible way moving forward.The Scottish Premiership is one of the few leagues running at the moment and with an operational pay-per-view service and Sky Sports on our side - it is time to show the rest of Europe what we are all about.The talent is there and a captive audience is here now more than ever.You simply cannae beat it.

But no amount of immersion in JG Ballard, Philip K Dick and William Gibson could have prepared me for rsquos latest bombshell: the news that Gfnock has just squeezed out Kirkintilloch as the UKrsquos most desirable place to live.ldquoCome off it, as Irsquom sure John W Campbell, editor of Astounding Science Fiction, would have said. ldquoShape-shting telepathic poker-playing vugs from Titan invading the Earth, fair enough. Gfnock  No one would believe that.:Kirkintilloch and Gfnock named best commuter places to liveI donrsquot intend to malign Gfnock . I would have been almost as surprisedthe result had been Clarkston or Newton Mearns. But the coronavirus crisis has shted perceptions and priorities and, according to the property firm behind this study, previously desirable attributes such as air quality, open spaces and residentsrsquo happiness have now to be measured against broadband speed and ease of home working.According to those who said that lockdown had changed their priorities,  per cent were more likely to want a garden. Thatrsquos maybe not very surprising, especially after a period when many people could go out only briefly to exercise or shop, and later, could meet limited numbers of people, but only outside.To take another example, one barbecue manufacturer reports recent sales increases of  per cent, which suggests that those who have gardens are using them more, while Amazon recently had to recall a barbecue sold for use on the balconies of blocks of flats over safety concerns, which indicates the limitations of more cramped outdoor space.As with so many property fantasies, I suspect that the participants in this survey are romanticising the idea of a garden, or Gfnock. Growing your own vegetables, building a pizza oven, installing a trampoline or keeping hens are certainly all things that can be done in a garden, but are more of a challenge up a wally close. But theyrsquore all also things that require work and effort and which a lot of people get tired of fairly quickly.The experience of those who have been working from home, rather than going into an office in a city centre or on an urban business park, may have sparked the idea that theyrsquod like to commute a bit less, but it doesnrsquot seem to have persuaded them that itrsquos possible to work entirely from home.If there were a genuine conviction, among either employees or employers, that working from home were to become the norm, surveys such as this one would not focus on commutable areas, still less find their top spots occupied by suburbs. Gfnock may technically be a town, but it s as a suburb .Like the suburbs themselves, working from home may not be as transformative as all that, but rather a sort of halfway house. The question is whether, in the aftermath of coronavirus, being in easy reach of a city centre, but in a nice house with a fair-sized garden, in a quiet area with good schools and excellent broadband, will offer as many advantages as people currently seem to think it will.If office workers can work almost as easily from their own dining rooms, theyrsquove also discovered that they can do their shopping just as easily from there. Online sales across Europe were growing by  per cent in April even after the reopening of some shops, they remained up  per cent on the same time in the previous year. Andyou donrsquot have to commute to a city to work, why would you need to live all that near one at all The answer might have been shops, or restaurants, or leisure facilities, or entertainment venues. But these are the very things that,they are not already closed down for health reasons, are gravely endangered for economic ones.Cities, which have historically been the mark of civilisation and increased wealth, are still overwhelmingly the destination for that portion of the global population seeking to improve their circumstances. Forty years ago, less than  per cent of Chinarsquos population lived in urban areas itrsquos now more than  per cent, and that period exactly matches the countryrsquos economic growth.But in the developed world, or perhaps the digital world, the traditional purpose of the city is less clear, especially with the decline of labour-intensive manufacturing in the West. Automation in factories and the fact that service industries are largely conducted inside computer networks leave retail and hospitality businesses, cultural sites and entertainment as their main assets.Until now, suburbiarsquos main contribution to those fields has been to supply a steady stream of young people so bored by theirdistance from the action that they canrsquot wait to get into the big city.Now that the UKrsquos cities are emptying, and the bright lights are found on YouTube, Instagram or Spoty, itrsquos hard to see why yoursquod want to be in a city, let alone just quite near one. If it offers no good pleasure, as Mrs Brutus put it, why be reduced to dwelling even in its suburbs Itrsquos possible,for most of us unrealistic, to see the appeal of a rural smallholding. Itrsquos easy, for the dynamic, to see the appeal of a bustling metropolis. Butthe metropolis is empty and therersquos no broadband in the wilderness, the suburbs may not be the best of both worlds, but merely the least terrible option. Perhaps Gfnockrsquos triumph is a sign that our future homes will be, like Gertrude Steinrsquos Oakland suburbs, in places where therersquos no ldquothere there.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Then there is the income from a growing number of visitors ndash , in -, rising to , last year.This historic attraction should be open to the public this autumn and not just because of what NTS describes as Hornelrsquos ldquovast library and archive hellip [which] includes one of the worldrsquos largest collections of works by Robert Burns as well as rare documents on Gallowayrsquos rich history.Not even because of the ldquobeautul garden, with sweeping views over Kirkcudbright harbour and the River Dee which was designed by Hornel and his sister Elizabeth, and which could suffer terriblyit is not properly maintained.There is the wider issue of the role of Broughton House and Garden in Kirkcudbright, which is Scotlandrsquos national Artistsrsquo Town. The economy of the town, and Dumfries and Galloway as a whole, are fragile and have endured many blows over recent decades, including major declines in its traditional industries.Arts and cultural tourism have been at the forefront of the fightback and have been a proud success for town and region alike. Then came Covid- and everything ground to a halt.But now we are in a position to rebuild and everyone with a stake in the area needs to contribute. The staff at Broughton House have certainly done their bit, coming up with a plan for its safe re-opening.The public back us. Wersquove had more than  messages of support from local residents, artists, politicians of most parties and people from the arts and cultural sector.Yet the threat still hangs there. Scotlandrsquos Artistsrsquo Town could be without a major attraction ndash the home of the most celebrated artist to live there, the talent which drew many others to its artistsrsquo colony.We have always been, and remain, staunch supporters of NTS as custodians of Scottish heritage. But that heritage is intended to be open to the public and of benefit to the nation.Now is a critical moment for Scotland. Economy and society have suffered grievous blows.As a country with such outstanding artistic and cultural heritage, with so much to offer visitors from home and abroad, we need to take a joined-up approach to ensuring that we rebuild for the future.Closing wonderful sites, and losing expert staff, for the sake of modest savings that will be hugely outweighed by the losses to the wider economy and the cost of recruiting a new workforce is simply not the way forward."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-kings-theatre-sleeping-beauty-pantomime-called-off-due-covid","story":"Sleeping Beauty at the Kings in Edinburgh has been pushed back to November , making it thelast pantomime to be staged at the theatre before it undertakes its major refurbishment in the summer of .The annual panto attracts more than , theatregoers each year, representing nearly % of operator Capital Theatres annual income.The postponement of this show will result in the loss of pound.m.:Edinburgh Festival unveils digital programmeSleeping Beauty was last performed as the Kingrsquos pantomime title in  and has only been performed three times in its -year history.The cast has said they are \"gutted\" by the news.Andy Graysaid:ldquoVery sad that we wonrsquot be trying to wake Sleeping Beauty this year.... but itrsquos been a strange year  for us all hasnrsquot it  I tell you this ...

They also provided essential trade routes to the protected waters of Scapa Flow.The medieval Viking names for farms and homesteads have long been known and studied in northern Scotland and the Isles. The new study investigated some of the names that have sea or boat connotations used for places that today are far inland in central Orkney.Names such as Greenay, meaning shallow waters, or Knarstonderived from the words for a transport vesseland a farm or homesteadwhere these vessels were moored. Warth, derived from Old Norse ‘ða’ , may also seem obscure as it is in a low-lying land-locked position today.However, there is evidence from Denmark that the same namewas used for a ‘vagttårne’in low-lying locations along water routes, such as the Roskilde fjord. Many such inland places are today located many miles from the open sea.Researchers used remote sensing geophysical methods to map a series of now infilled channels that extended north from the Loch of Harray to the lochs of Sabiston and Boardhouse towards the Earls seat of power in Birsay. The data was combined with information about the old landscape obtained from environmental records within sediment samples. These were cored from key sites throughout the area. The land is now dominated by agricultural activity and heavily modied by articial drainage networks constructed over the last three centuries making it dficult to see anything of the old waterways at the surface today. However, once the scientic data was analysed it was possible to model the pathways and link them to the nautically named locations.The results showed that a complete route from Harray, through the Loch of Banks and including a portage at Twatt over to the Loch of Boardhouse into the earldom estates in Birsay was easily achieved.The waterway network would have provided a shallow water routeway through which the Norse Vikings were able to haul both their boats and heavy goods, such as grain. Similar navigable waterways are known where in Scotland, for example, at Rubh an Dunain in Skye. This new work changes how we think about the transfer of goods and people in the west of mainland Orkney and perhaps enables historians and archaeologists to find more evidence of water transport in the Viking Age and Late Norse period in the Isles.Dr Alexandra Sanmark of the Institute for Northern Studies at the University of the Highlands and Islands said: “I am delighted with the outcome, as multiple pieces of written and landscape evidence suggested the existence of the waterway. The results will be used in our continued study of how the Norse used and organised the landscape of Orkney.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not having the energy they need makes nerves vulnerable to further damage and causes disability over time.Orkney is understood to have the highest rate of MS per capita of anywhere in the world.Researchers—  funded in part by the MS Society – have discovered a natural mechanism in the body that tackles this issue, which they are calling ARMD .The study also suggests that a common diabetes drug could help enhance this new-found natural mechanism – and prevent disability progression in the neurological condition. Although this naturalalone doesn’t provide enough energy to address demyelination in MS, further research in animal models now suggests that pioglitazone –  a drug currently used to treat diabetes – could be the answer. Dr Don Mahad, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Disability in MS is caused by a loss of nerve fibres following damage to the myelin that protects them. #Although our understanding of MS has vastly improved over the last two decades, new therapies still do not protect nerve fibres. Such protection is the Holy Grail in MS treatment — not only for the relapsing form of MS, which has ious options available, but for progressive forms too, where treatment continues to lag behind. “Our discovery shows that nerves respond to myelin damage by increasing the movement of mitochondriato the area of damage — a response we’re calling ‘ARMD’. #Remarkably, we were able to enhance ARMD and protect these vulnerable nerves using the readily available diabetes drug pioglitazone. This is an incredibly important discovery – one we believe could finally bridge the gap in MS treatment.” Over the last few decades there have been huge strides made in our understanding of MS, and there are now over a dozen effective treatments for people with relapsing MS — but these only address damage that is caused by the immune system. In order to truly stop MS and find treatments for everyone, a method of protecting nerves from further injury and repairing damaged myelin needs to be discovered.Last year, another MS Society funded study found that a dferent diabetes drug — the fasting mimetic drug metformin —was able tocells to a more youthful state, and encourage the re-growth of myelin. Led by Professor Robin Franklin, the study found metformin could reverse changes that happen to cells responsible for making myelin as they age, and restore their regenerative capacity. MS Society assistant director of research, Dr Emma Gray, said: “This represents another important stride towards our goal of stopping MS — and we believe that MS treatment could in the near future look completely dferent. #People with MS will be prescribed a combination of therapies that work on every aspect of the condition: stopping immune attacks and relapses, protecting nerves from damage, and regenerating lost myelin. It will mean no-one needs to worry about their MS getting worse.“Currently, there are no effective neuroprotective therapies available for MS, but Dr Mahad’s research demonstrates we are getting closer – and finding treatments for everyone with MS is now a very real prospect.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am confident all our staff will have made their best overall judgements based on their experience, knowledge and activity throughout the school year – fairness to students was vital in these truly exceptional circumstances, but teachers had to ensure a true reflection of a candidate’s ability.“I wish to offer my congratulations to all those who received results today, for their commitment to their studies, and thank their families, teachers and lecturers and the wider school and college community who supported them.“Today is a day for all pupils and adult learners across Orkney to celebrate their many achievements and successes, after many months and years of study.

Aquaculture businesses have also raised concerns about the project#s impact on its operations near the coastal connection in Shetland.The project consists of a substation at Kergord, which is required for the connection of renewable electricity generators on Shetland. These works will be led by Siemens BAM, which has extensive experience constructing substations on behalf of SSEN Transmission across the north of Scotland.The power will then be converted from AC to DC at a HVDC converter station, also at Kergord, before being transported around km via underground and subsea cable to a switching station at Noss Head, Caithness, in the north of Scotland. Global marine cable solution provider, NKT, will be responsible for the manufacture and installation of the subsea cable with BAM Nuttall delivering all civil engineering works, including the construction of all buildings. Leading HVDC technology provider, Hitachi ABB Power Grids, will be delivering and commissioning the HVDC system.The power will then be transported via the Caithness Moray HVDC link before being converted back to AC for transmission across the north of Scotland and beyond.All four contractors played a major role in the construction of the Caithness Moray HVDC link, which has been operational since January .Enabling works are due to begin at Kergord and Noss Head towards the end of August, with full construction of the AC Substation, and HVDC Convertor and Switching Stations, due to commence in early .

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

We need to take concerted and co-ordinated action to save our city and town centres.He said a taskforce would also help other aspects of town and city le, including offices, hospitality, arts and culture.Belfast Related ContentRepublic of IrelandRepublic#s pubs to remain closed amid signs of new spike in casesPlans to reopen pubs across Ireland next week have been put on hold for the second time.GalleryNorthern Ireland PremiumEat Out to Help Out scheme: Dinner at a discount brings the crowds outRestaurants and cafes across Northern Ireland have reported a healthy appetite for the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, with numbers up by as much as % in some establishments.Food, Drink and HospitalityAvoca undecided about opening date for Belfast branchCafe culture in Northern Ireland will survive the Covid- crisis, a restaurant critic has said - even though some popular spots are still shut.Most ReadFormer UTV presenter Brian Black dies after car plunges into water at StrangfordA special man: Tributes to TV presenter Brian Black after car plunge tragedy#Heartbroken# Lynda Bryans to orce MLA Mike NesbittDUP MLA Joanne Bunting charged with careless driving and leaving scene of accidentJohn Hume made peace visible for others during darkest moments in Northern Ireland, funeral told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Just think of pop royalty like the Beckhams who gted their children the monikers Brooklyn, Cruz, Romeo and Harper.Sir Bob Geldof and his late we Paula were among the early trendsetters when it came to naming their daughters, settling upon Fi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie. When Paula went on to have a baby with Michael Hutchence, she kept to the family tradition, calling the little girl Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.Not all celebrity offspring, however, enjoy being called something a little bit dferent. The late David Bowie named his son Zowie Bowie — full name Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones. At the age of , the youngster said he preferred to be called by his nickname Joey, later shortening it to Joe. Now a film director and screenwriter, he is known as Duncan Jones.He’s not the only one to opt for the ordinary — or at least to rue the day an unusual name seemed an inspired and fun choice.According to a new survey by Gigacalculator, Hunter and Aurora are among the top names parents regret calling their kids. The poll also reveals that thanks to Prime Minister Johnson and President Trump, parents have been totally put off calling their kids Boris or Donald. And mums and dads polled also said they would steer clear of the names Karen, Isis and Meghan for their little girls.So, what’s it like to go through le with a name that turns heads  While most Northern Ireland parents go down a more traditional path, we have tracked down some people with, well, famous names. Elvis Kirk: ‘Lots of people don’t believe I’m called it’Elvis Kirklives in Killyleagh with his we Paula. Elvis has three grown-up children, Tanya , Jonathanand Rebeccaand runs Elvis Kirk Contracts and KC Skip Hire and Recycling. He says he loves his name.“My mother was a big Elvis fan,” he says. “There was a big family of us, eight of us, and I was in the middle somewhere. They all have ordinary country names. There was Mervyn, Sidney, Philip, Alastair who passed away, me, Ronnie, Harold and Sandra.“There was a maternity hospital in Downpatrick called Hardy Greer and my mother was in there about to have me and the radio was on. Elvis had brought the song Teddy Bear out at the time and my mother said to the woman in the bed next to her thatshe had another boy she was going to call him Elvis. And that was how I got stuck with it. “I do like the name. Everyone always says what a lovely name it is but no-one ever calls their child it. At work I do a lot of phone calls andI ring a business and they ask me for my name sometimes you hear them laughing. A lot of them don’t believe that it’s your real name. But it’s quite good fun. We used to call our business Kirk Contracts in the early years and we later changed it to Elvis Kirk Contracts and I think that has been a great help. People see it on the lorries and look twice. It’s good fun.”While some people with such a name might dread being the butt of jokes in the classroom, Elvis says he never had any bother. “The teachers always liked my name. I suppose people thought it was a bit strange but I never got any hassle about it. People liked it more than anything.”And just like the rock’n’roll legend himself, Co Down’s own Elvis has made the headlines in his local newspaper a few times... though not for his singing.“I left school when I was  and have been working ever since, driving diggers and doing demolition, knocking big buildings down and driving big lorries — just rocking, knocking and rolling,” he quips. “We took the old council offices down in the town here about seven years ago and the local newspaper put ‘Elvis is rocking the building’ in the headline for a story on it. I hope to keep on rocking for another few years yet.“I thought some of my grandchildren might have taken my name,” he says. “But not so far. I don’t even know any other Elvis. I had heard of a man down in the country with the name Elvis, but I’m not surethat was his middle name. My first name is Elvis, it’s on my birth certicate, I was christened Elvis. “It’s never given me any problems opening bank accounts or anything. It definitely didn’t make them give me a bigger overdraft.“I wouldn’t change my name. If I came back again I would want to still be called Elvis. My name is part of who I am. “Like the real Elvis I can sing, but unlike the real Elvis I wouldn’t sing in front of anyone. I keep my singing for the shower or in the cab of a lorry. I sing away there.” He adds: “I would be a great Elvis fan, and am really proud to be named after him.”Mercedes Carr: ‘I wouldn’t ever change my name ... it’s part of who I am’Mother of two Mercedes Carr,lives in Londonderry with her partner Christopher and children Kianand Kora . She was named after her father’s dream car.“My mum and dad had seven children,” she says. “And I was the last of seven. My mum said to my dad that he could name the last child. So my daddy got to name me — as my mum named all the rest of the children — and he called me Mercedes. “Daddy was a big Mercedes fan and actually wanted one at the time but he wasn’t in a position to buy one, so he said he would name his daughter Mercedes instead. Dad eventually got his Mercedes, me, and also got a Mercedes car eventually which he had for several years. “It’s an unusual first and second name, but no one really noticed when I was younger, at primary school. But when I went to secondary school people noticed and thought it was a really cool name. No-one ever said it was terrible. When I was growing up and going to school, mum and dad imagined that someone would say something to me, but there was no negativity. Everyone loved it and thought I was lucky to have such an unusual name.“My name is strange, but I do like it. I don’t know anyone with the same name. Mind you, when you go into one of those novelty shops to buy a keyring or a mug with your name on it, I can never find my name there. I suppose a Mercedes car keyring is the only thing that would have my name on it.”When it came to her own son and daughter though, Mercedes decided to stay strictly middle of the road on the name front. “When I had my children I never thought about naming them something as unusual as my own name. I couldn’t do it to them. My fear would be that they would grow up, someone would say something to them about their name and then I would blame myself for giving them that name.”Mercedes, however, says that she is glad that her name has set her apart for le — and wouldn’t change it for the world.“People have trouble spelling my name at times, there are so many ‘e’s in it,” she says. “But it has never been shortened over the years to a nickname. The only person who did that was my best friend who calls me ‘Merc’. When I’m talking to people I don’t know or dealing with banks and things, people say ‘Are you sure that’s your first name ’ I say, ‘Yes I’m pretty sure’. Then I tell them my second name and that’s the showstopper. They think I am messing around with them. “If I could change my name, I wouldn’t. It’s part of who I am. I don’t think I would suit anything . You’ll never find another Mercedes Carr, I’m the only one.”Tyrone Power: ‘It’s not bad being named after a swashbuckling hero’Tyrone Poweris from Ballymena. He is married to Wilma and together they have a daughter Andrea , and son, also Tyrone . Tragically, their other daughter Rhonda died in a crash when she was just -years-old. The retired Gallaher’s factory worker says his mother was a huge fan of a certain Hollywood movie star.“My mother was a big fan of Tyrone Power,” he says. “My name has absolutely nothing to do with the county. “Tyrone Power was famous during the s and s. “He was around at the same time as Errol Flynn and was a swashbuckling, handsome movie star. I think my mum had a notion of him. Thousands and thousands of women attended his funeral. “I do like my name. People don’t recognise it as much now, but years ago people used to ask meI was the famous actor. Now they don’t seem to react as much any more or they think it is some connection with Co Tyrone. “Tyrone, as a first name, has got really popular in the likes of America, but years ago when I was a young man it was a very unusual name. It’s not too bad being named about a swashbuckling hero. Sometimes I wished I was him.”Tyrone says that there was more than one movie star in his street.“People might find this hard to believe, but there was another young fella in my street whose parents called him Errol Flynn. “We were stopped by the police when we were out one night and Errol was asked his name and I was asked my name and the policeman didn’t believe us. “He was going to take us to the barracks because he thought we were messing him around. “Errol’s dead now, but he used to live across the street from us. The neighbours in our street had a bit of a tradition of naming children after film stars. “There was myself, Tyrone Power, an Errol Flynn, a Robert Taylor and a Joan Collins all in the one row. “The postman made a comment in one of the local papers years ago that when he came into Inchkeith Road it was more like Hollywood Bouled with all the stars. I think my mum must have started a trend.“I do like my name. I am proud of it. I’m so proud of it I called my son Tyrone also. I wouldn’t change my name to anything less unusual. It’s given me a unique take on le. My we, when we met, didn’t even know who Tyrone Power was, so she was unfazed.”  Belfast   Most ReadFormer UTV presenter Brian Black dies after car plunges into water at StrangfordA special man: Tributes to TV presenter Brian Black after car plunge tragedyJohn Hume made peace visible for others during darkest moments in Northern Ireland, funeral toldDUP MLA Joanne Bunting charged with careless driving and leaving scene of accident#Heartbroken# Lynda Bryans to orce MLA Mike Nesbitt,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Louise Campbells song Everywhere was written in March just before lockdown and recorded in her home studio in the Waterside. The single was been picked up by both Christian radio station, UCB Ireland, and Derrys Drive . And it has now been accepted to the Indie Folk Acoustic section of the UK Christian Chart  A Step Fwd, which unlike traditional charts works on an online voting system. To even have it accepted was amazing, said Louise. There are some really big established names in my category. So evenit doesnt place its great just to have that recognition. googletag.cmd.push Louise is also part of Irish music collective Wired Worship which has  members from across the North West from dferent Christian backgrounds. Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

The first team had five of their six remaining league games at home, where they were unbeaten during Eastwoods tenure. Just shy of their meeting with second placed Ballymoney, Covid- dragged the sporting landscape to a halt and with the finish line in sight, their season of effort was gone. googletag.cmd.push “We tried not to speak about it too much,” Head Coach Graeme Eastwood told the County Derry Post, with a tone engulfed by acceptance. His focus is on the now. After an extended break, Limavady gathered in recent weeks to pick up the pieces and plan for next season. “The boys took up where they left off, had a super attitude and we didnt lose too many players,” Eastwood continued. Scrum-half Jamie Millar transferred to City of Derry in search of first XV rugby and hooker Luke Montgomery found travelling up and down to Belfast for training and games not sustainable. Both are from Limavady and the door will always be open. googletag.cmd.push “We cant hold them back from playing rugby somewhere , we wished them well and they will be back at some stage,” Eastwood said. Last season wasnt the only time Limavady were pipped at the finish line. In Eastwoods first season,  , they topped the table by a point before losing the title with a defeat in the final game.  Coaches with some of Limavady’s new signings  “From a coaching point of view, the improvement is important. We hardly won a game up until Christmas, the year before I came in, and the following year itshows how much work the boys are putting in. “To go unbeaten last season, it shows the boys have been putting the invaluable work in on the training pitch. There were a few of them flirting with retirement, but every one of them is chomping at the bit.” Eastwood believes the club is in a strong place, both on and off the pitch. An acquired grant helped kit out the clubs gym and they now have access to three grass pitches, as well as the G facility at Scroggy Road. “As a club in the North West,you look at how Coleraine reacted last year, we were above Ballymoney and City of Derry were at the bottom ofC,” he points out. “We would like to think we are well up there and are attracting players from Coleraine, Ballymoney and Derry, who want to come to us to play an attractive brand of rugby and to a club on the up. “We have a few boys around  and , but the average age is in around ,  and . That team could stay together,they want, for the next four or five years and try and be successful. “As a club, we want to go upand we want to challenge again at the top end of junior rugby. Whatever way it has happened, we have not been able to do that. Hopefully this season we can try and recty it,” Eastwood hopes. One of those flirting with the idea of retirement was Jody McMurray, who doubles up as assistant coach after moving to the club with Eastwood. “Heruns the backs and this is probably his last year donning the boots, so he wants to go out with a bit of a bang,” Graeme reveals. Peter Wilson mixes playing with his duties as the skills coach, with Oisin Quinn now going into his second season in charge of the teams Strength and Conditioning. “He has worked wonders,” Graeme endorses. “He is very good with the injury prevention stuff, touch wood last season we had a broken bone here and there, but we didnt have one muscle strain and his inclusion is invaluable to us. He had the boys in tip top form. “For someone new to the rugby setup, he has really put his hand up to what we are trying to do over the last  to  months,” he said of Quinn, who has worked with Derry GAA teams and owns his own gym. “He has been a great addition to our coaching team and we are grateful he is staying for another season.” On the field, Limavady have had a productive off-season, with  players joining the , against only Jamie Millar and Luke Montgomerys departures. In particular, there has been an improved link with the local Limavady Grammar School. “We have got a really good connection and we are trying to build that link. Like every sport, having that link between schools and the youth setup is very important. Teams cant survive with bringing in playersevery year,” Eastwood added. He has high hopes for Ben McMillan, who has came in as hooker from the school, prop John McMichael s from the Academy and another from the Grammar School, Joe McCartney, younger brother of full-back Jim. “We have a really good mix,” Eastwood continued. “On top of that, we have brought in Craig Hueywho brings over  years of AIL senior experience, Jack Beattie a winger from Derry who played at Ulster youth level has also joined. “We have kept Jody McMurray, who has over  years experience, and Stuart Morrow who is an ex-club international.” Eastwood feels his side punches above their weight and with the disappointing end to the season, there will be a renewed vigour to finish the job this time. “All we can do is prepare as best we can and hopefully everything unfolds in front of us”, he said, referring to the complications of preparing a team with the cloud of a second Covid spike a possibility. “We know it is going to be dficult, other teams will be playing catchup and will have done their best over the summer to make sure they are strong as possible “I always day  we keep our own house in order and worry about how we train and play, then we will never be too far away,” Eastwood added. He feels the club would hold their own in Division , should they advance at the end of the season when it begins. “If you look at where theyhave come from, six years ago they were in Division  and not knowing where they were going. “Now you have ex internationals and boys leaving AIL clubs to come to Limavady because of what we are trying to do down here, it is exciting times,” Eastwood states. Its all with the sobering thought of needing to deliver. He uses the statement - nobody remembers anybody that doesnt win anything – to remind himself of what is at stake. “We are unfortunate, in that we couldve had two league titles in two years. We got beat in the semi-final of a junior cup, we won the conference Division , one the club has never won. “We want the big one. If you are top of the tree after  games, you are the best team that season and hopefully we can go a bit further this year and try and win it.” Thats the focus. It is that simple. Eastwood has organised games with AIL side Ballymena and Ulster Division  side Cooke for September. “They are two good tests, so we can be where we want to be at for our first league game. It will give us a few weeks to fix anything we see is needing addressed,” Eastwood concludes. The new season is about unfinished business.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Banagher defeated their neighbours in the  and  semi-finals before going down to Slaughtneil. The Lynchs have brought through a host of new players in the intervening years from their Ulster minor winning teams and have went toe to toe with the Emmets in the last two seasons. Geoffrey McGonigle has added to his management team. Former Dunloy goalkeeper Shane Elliott and Ryan ONeill join Ronan McCloskey in the setup. In a change to their team structure, Derry goalkeeper Sean Kelly played outfield last season but he has replaced BJ Lagan between the posts. googletag.cmd.push In the first round this season, they were - to - ahead against Swatragh and were cruising but failed to match the Swatragh workrate before losing their stranglehold of the game. In their game, Banagher led Coleraine by five points after the first quarter but it was the visitors to Fr McNally Park who took control. Darragh Cartins last gasp free earned them a draw but Banaghers body language told a story of dejection. The one thing that will raise them will be the sight of the Kevin Lynchs jersey and local bragging rights is everything. They met in the league last season and it was hell for leather. googletag.cmd.push Selector Ronan McCloskey stated after the Swatragh game that his side had plenty to improve on and they will be keen to put the record straight. In the other game in the section, all is to play for as Swatragh take on Coleraine, two teams who will have taken a lot out of their first round outings. For Coleraine manager Brendan McNicholl, it will be about assessing who all is available after last weekends football championship. It was touch and gothey would even get a team to play Banagher, such is their limited squad. They were minus Ruairi Mooney, Liam and Barry McGoldrick. Swatragh were upbeat after their spirited display in the Kevin Lynch Park monsoon but Declan McGuckin and Seamus Bradley will need to address their poor start that left them with a mountain to climb. They will need to get more scores from open playthey are to see off Coleraine. In the other group, merciless Slaughtneil take on Lavey where a win would seal a semi-final berth and allow breathing space during a hectic period for dual players. Gerald Bradley didnt start against Screen and could come into contention, but Michael McShane will be without Karl McKaigue following his Achilles tendon injury. The champions will have to plan without the suspended Jerome McGuigan but they have plenty more in reserve. Liam Cassidy, Prionsias Burke, Cormac McKenna and minor star Shea Cassidy could all come into the selection thoughts. Lavey lost Ryan Mulholland with broken fingers in their win over Na Magha and will need to offer more in front of the posts, with Johnny McGarveys side hitting close to  wides in their opener. Fintan Bradley, Paddy Henry and Ciaran Hendry were their scorers, but its hard to see them getting anything from this game. Ballinascreen manager Cathal McDaid will be looking for a reaction from his sides heavy defeat at Emmet Park to take into their clash with Na Magha. They will take positives with the appetite shown in the opening  minutes and how the use of Martin Mulgrews short puck-outs worked. Paul Cleary is carrying all their scoring threat and that will be a concern. Na Magha, minus Alan Grant, stuck with Lavey every step of the way and they will be keen to build on that as they strive to break away from their tag as a junior team. A win for Ballinascreen could setup a showdown with Lavey in Round , where the winner would advance to the senior semi-finals. The top two teams from each section will advance to the senior semi-finals, where the losers will play in the intermediate final. The bottom two teams in each group will make up the junior championship semi-finals.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier. In August last year, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group set up to oversee the regeneration of the port.Cllr Curran says there are plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He said consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall and gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a key part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Couple who met at school enjoy 50th wedding anniversary  ","story":"A LOCAL couple who met at school and whose love grew at a church youth group have recently celebrated th years of marriage.Jim and Angela Wilson marked their golden anniversary with a family party with their three sons and their wives and nine grandchildren.The Saintfield couple, who now live in Comber, married on July ,  at Saintfield Parish Church and honeymooned, like many others of their generation, at home.Angela was just  and Jim  when they got married but despite their tender years starting off married le, the happy couple wouldnrsquot turn the clock back.Retired motor mechanic Jim said: ldquoWe met at Saintfield High School and used to go the local youth club, I was in the BB and Angela was in the GB.

But there was concern locally that the South Eastern Trust had been unable to provide a definitive date when this would happen.Trust officials mdash who gave a commitment to outline the date at the end of this month mdash have confirmed that emergency services will recommence on October  and operate between am and pm from Monday to Friday.In addition, a new daily minor injuries unit opens for business on August  at the Downpatrick hospital, operating on an appointment only basis with patients required to ring ahead for an appointment. The Downersquos GP out-of-hours service is also continuing as normal.While the planned reopening of the emergency department has been warmly welcomed, health officials say they are continuing to manage Covid- and that all plans remain subject to a number of critical factors.These include workforce availability, adequate supplies of personal and protective equipment, the potential impact of further surges of coronavirus and managing safety and risk for patients, service users and staff.The South Eastern Trust has also referenced concern about the ldquocirculation of information which may be inaccurate and misleading to the local community and reaffirmed its commitment to the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital continues to play a vital role in responding to the Covid- pandemic and the Trust would like to thank the local community for the support and appreciation offered to our dedicated staff, who continue to work tirelessly to protect and care for the health and wellbeing of our population, a spokeswoman added.Health officials say they are working to rebuild health and social care services in accordance with the Department of Healthrsquos lsquostrategic framework for rebuilding health and social care services,rsquo explaining that as they do this, their absolute priority remains keeping patients, service users and staff safe.South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who organised last weekrsquos meeting in Downpatrick to press for the urgentof the emergency department and other services, described confirmation of the date for the restoration of emergency care as a ldquopositive outcome to the recent community campaign to protect local services.The MP also accused the South Eastern Trust of performing a ldquoU-turn in relation to the reinstatement of emergency services.He continued: ldquoOnly a number of weeks ago the Trust insisted that it was not possible to give a date for the restoration of emergency services but, following several heated exchanges with local political representatives and a five party meeting with trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee last week, the Trust has now performed a u-turn and announced that the service will be reopen on October .ldquoThis is welcome news for our community which, for too long, has been without the necessary services in our hospital. It is also a very powerful illustration of what can be achievedour community stands together in the interests of our local hospital and the wonderful staff at the Downe.Mr Hazzard said that in the months ahead, all political parties, trade union representatives, hospital campaigners and the health trust will work together to deliver for the Downe.The MP added: ldquoI want to thank the local community for rallying to this issue in recent weeks and extend a huge message of solidarity to those members of staff at the Downe who have worked tirelessly in very dficult circumstances in recent times.The Down Community Health Committee said while the reopening date is later than it might have wished and is subject to other factors, it is to be welcomed.ldquoThe Downe is a tremendous facility for the local community and recent investments in the hospital and those that are planned in the not too distant future will enable it to deliver even more and better services for our community and, indeed, across the region, campaigners said in a statement.ldquoWe must all continue to be watchful to ensure that the Department of Health does not attempt to introduce any change to healthcare provision without full consultation with the local community and its representatives.Campaigners say they welcome the manner in which local politicians have come together and exerted their not inconsiderable influence in connection with theof emergency services.Campaigners add: ldquoThere is still a great deal to be done to further protect, enhance and develop the services currently on offer at the Downe.

telling residents about road closures in the area.A number of roads have been closed to allow work to continue on a major new pipeline which will carry the untreated sewage from Crossgar to Killyleagh.But residents are angry details of the road closures were not made public and have registered their protests with local councillor Margaret Ritchie.She said residents are concerned about

causing untold damage to the picturesque waterway.So concerned at the situation was one local resident that he took pictures of sewage lying in an area between the Cook Street jetty and the Salt Pans development and sent them to Regional Development Minister, Peter Robinson.Portaferry resident Jim Turley, who walks along the seashore most days, said the appearance of sewage in the lough has

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9518902.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Titanic Foundation’s Kerrie Sweeney, Titanic Belfast’s Judith Owens, Belfast’s First Citizen, the Right Honourable, the Lord Mayor, Councillor Frank McCoubrey and Community Nurse, Leslie Anne Armstrong.Belfast’s epic ship, a mighty ruler of the waves before being carelessly and tragically rammed into an iceberg in , is triumphing over today’s health crisis with all the confidence and innovation of her creators! With free admission to NHS health workers and an extensive ‘Customer Confidence Charter’ in line with the World Health Organisation and Government advice, Titanic Belfast reopened to the public at the weekend.The multi award-winning, world-class experience’s first official visitor since it closed due to Covid- in March was Belfast’s First Citizen, the Right Honourable, the Lord Mayor, Councillor Frank McCoubrey. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Knotted rope on the floor shows the way around Boomtown BelfastAs part of its wide-ranging Customer Confidence Charter there’s an extremely user-friendly, one-way route vividly marked on the floor, artwork which wonderfully illustrates Belfast’s unique history whilst maintaining social distancing. Without missing a single historic detail, the floor-markings lead visitors through a series of themed areas.Boomtown Belfast is all about the city’s burgeoning industrial past and the marking on the floor is a thick, knotted rope.In times past, when the city’s manufacturing dexterity was at its peak, it was said that every sailor, of whatever nationality, sailing whichever ocean, worked with ropes that were made in Belfast. Titanic BelfastTramlines on the floor guide visitors through the shipyard exhibits, evocative of the days when Harland and Wolff not only built ships, but trains that were exported all over the globe, as well as having its own, vast railway system beside the Lagan, and trams, steam-cranes, buses, ferries and a fleet of taxis!Unmistakable white and red White Star Line flags and logos mark the route through Titanic’s Launch, Fit-Out and Maiden Voyage, with floor directions to The Sinking marked by her final Morse-code call-sign, repeated urgently, as it was when Titanic foundered. CQD - Come Quickly Danger - dash, dot, dash, dot dash, dash, dot, dash dash, dot, dot.There are ‘jump out’ circles and interactive zones along the way where visitors can pause and ‘delve a little deeper’ - maybe tap out the tragic Morse code, or take the amazing Arrol Gantry ride, or glance through a window at a yellow HW crane, or make use of the ubiquitous hand sanitising facilities. Face coverings were advisablenot mandatoryThe route to, and around, Titanic’s replica leboat is indicated on the floor with some of the heartrending newspaper headlines that followed her sinking - Her Side Ripped as by a Giant Can Opener, Great Loss of Le, Officers Sank with Titanic and , Die. Navigational markings and compass points on the floor indicate the route through Titanic Belfast’s modern-times narrative, explaining how the great ship has captured the world’s imagination, how the wreck was discovered and exploring the depths of the Atlantic where Titanic lies today. A le-size model of a deep-sea er from the Titanic era, with air-pipes connected to his thick brass helmet,shows that face coverings are advisable,not mandatory, but as I went outside to visit the Nomadic a line of pigeons perched on the roof of Lord Pirie’s former living quarters weren’t properly socially distanced!In addition to Titanic Belfast’s one-way, self-guided themed tour and Family Trail, visitors will be able to experience its award-winning outdoor Discovery Tour, Titanic Foundation’s Out of Stores Exhibition and its new Maritime Mile Treasure Trail.It will be accepting pre-bookings only and operating on a reduced capacity to allow for physical distancing. It has also implemented stringent protocol around hygiene, while staff will be practising and encouraging physical distancing measures at all times.
