It will create it.\u0027  ALEX BRUMMER: Why the EU always haggles like an aggressive market trader… then CAVES IN  Long before the British people voted to leave the EU in the referendum, before the term Brexit had even been coined, it was Grexit that was preoccupying the minds of Eurocrats.Greece came close to crashing out of the single currency on at least four occasions after a vast black hole opened up in the country’s accounts in 2009.At one stage, in 2012, the British banknote printers De La Rue was asked by the government in Athens to make contingency plans to print new drachma notes (Greece’s pre-euro currency) in preparation for what many called the ‘Double D’ solution to Greek economic problems – default on the country’s debt and devaluation with the return of the drachma.Today, Greece remains one of the 17 members of the eurozone – and that fact alone should lift Theresa May’s spirits as, armed with her newly acquired parliamentary majority, she returns to Brussels seeking at the very least to put a time limit on the backstop deal she signed up to for the Irish border.Each time a Greek default loomed into view, threatening the stability of the eurozone and raising the possibility that Italy or one of the other member countries might also head for the exit, the main protagonists – the hard-line German-dominated European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt and the European Commission in Brussels – caved in and authorised a bailout.          President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (left) and the European Chief Negotiator for the United Kingdom Exiting the European Union Michel Barnier (right)Last-ditch negotiations, usually conducted over a weekend when the financial markets were closed, would typically stretch into the early hours.Late-night deals were hatched against a backdrop of TV screens showing central Athens on fire and anti-austerity protesters ripping up flagstones in the capital’s Syntagma Square.The first £38billion bailout was agreed in the dead of night on April 23, 2010, by the troika of the ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund. It was one of several rescue packages for Greece, some of which required a change of government to get them over the line.What happened to Greece is typical of the Eurocrat tendency to fudge, to muddy the waters and eventually to seek compromise in a crisis situation.Indeed, the history of the EU is littered with examples of Britain locked into eleventh-hour talks with eurocrats as the UK has sought changes in our terms of membership.John Major worked through the night in 1991 to secure Britain’s opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty which would have dictated working conditions in Britain and could have undermined the labour market reforms pioneered by his predecessor Margaret Thatcher. Indeed, she was a fierce negotiator in organising rebates from Brussels from the UK’s oversized contributions to the EU budget.In 1984, in the imperial grandeur at the historic palace of Fontainebleau in France, European leaders painfully conceded the famous British EU budget contribution rebate – or, as the French sarcastically called it, ‘le chèque Britannique’.          A new poll reveals voters support May going for talks with the EU but only one in three believe she will be successfulAnd let’s not forget that in the teeth of his promise to hold an inout referendum, David Cameron returned from Brussels in the early hours one day in February 2016 with draft reform proposals agreed by European Council President Donald Tusk which he claimed would give Britain ‘special status’.In the event, the pledges made by Brussels were so anaemic that they failed to convince British voters that sovereignty could be maintained by voting Remain – a huge mistake by the eurocrats who failed to recognise the strength of anti-EU feeling among large swathes of the UK population.Both in national negotiations and in commercial transactions, reaching an accord more often or not comes down to the wire. Today, with the clock ticking inexorably to March 29, the desperation of the leaders of the other 27 EU countries to avoid an economic and financial crisis at the very moment that Germany and the eurozone are facing the bleak prospect of recession may be Theresa May’s best hope.This is regardless of how unyielding Brussels negotiators have been to date and their willingness to play havoc with business confidence and financial stability by its brinkmanship.The potential loss to Brussels of a £39billion one-off payment to a Commission cash-starved following years of economic slowdown, could potentially be a bargaining chip for the Prime Minister in the last-chance saloon.In the final analysis, as veteran witnesses of the late-night sessions in Brussels, Nice, Maastricht and other destinations tell me, it’s mainly Germany and, to a lesser extent, France which decide.Besieged by increasingly hostile populist movements, neither Berlin or Paris will want to make political life tougher than it already is.The politics of the EU, at their most raw, are little different to those of the bazaar. The natural tendency is to relish an aggressive haggle but then to compromise – eventually.   "},{"url":null,"title":"How weeks dithering bricks use helped push cost new EastEnders set","story":"    The Carter family outside the Queen Vic pub.

It was the right thing to do.’The bricks must be tinted, moss must be applied, and the peeling paint outside the Queen Vic pub will be recreated to mimic the current set.The soap’s existing set was built in 1984 using steel frames, plywood and plaster brick panels with the intention that it would be used for two years.

There is no other choice.‘If you want to be a shining star at the BBC, you are going to have to follow this course of action.’Asked whether he accepted this, Lord Hall said: ‘Yes I acknowledge that. People were pushed into these things. We’re saying that we’ve accepted responsibility. That’s full responsibility.’The BBC previously stood by a 2012 report published by Deloitte, which found ‘no evidence of any pressure to move staff to the PSC arrangements’.But yesterday Lord Hall and his deputy director-general, Anne Bulford, accepted that there was pressure regardless.Lord Hall said: ‘Going back and trying to find records of how these PSCs were set up and people’s correspondence with the BBC about them - we can’t find any record which point to one way or the other.‘But the evidence from people I’ve talked to is... that they were asked to take up PSCs’."},{"url":null,"title":"Dirty Duchess Argyll subject TV drama","story":"    Margaret Campbell, the Duchess of Argyll, is pictured outside the law courts in London in 1960 during what became a famous orce caseA British aristocrat known as the \u0027Dirty Duchess\u0027 of Argyll - whose husband accused her of sleeping with up to 88 men including government ministers and royals - will be the subject of a TV drama. The mini-series about Margaret Campbell, whose sex scandal made headlines in 1963, will be a spin-off of the BBC\u0027s award-winning A Very English Scandal. The Duchess\u0027s orce ignited public speculation when a list emerged of more than 80 men she had reportedly slept with, said to include two ministers and three members of the royal family. Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said the scandal made her the first woman to be publicly \u0027slut shamed\u0027.  Granting the orce, presiding judge Lord Wheatley said she \u0027was a completely promiscuous woman whose sexual appetite could only be satisfied with a number of men\u0027.The Duchess was the third wife of Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll, whose family owned Inveraray Castle in western Scotland. Born Margaret Whigham, she married wealthy American golfer Charles Sweeny in 1933, having three children with him. Sorry ladies, the nation has voted for its greatest icons of...Great British Bake Off star Nadiya opens up about her...Share this articleAfter orcing him in 1947 she married the Duke in 1951 but the marriage fell apart after her suspicious husband hired a locksmith to break open a cupboard at her house in Mayfair. The search allegedly uncovered love letters and polaroid photos of her engaging in sexual acts with her various partners.           First marriage: The Duchess of Argyll on her wedding day after marrying wealthy American golfer Charles Sweeny in 1933           Second marriage: Margaret on the day she became Duchess of Argyll, after marrying Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll, at Caxton Hall in London in March 1951  Margaret Campbell is pictured left at Inveraray Castle in Scotland in 1953 and right at a party in 1961.

But it will allow Murray to live pain-free and it could open the door to him becoming a tennis coach after he retires.    Murray had previously said ahead of the Australian Open earlier this month that he intended to retire after this year\u0027s WimbledonMurray was set for a farewell six months after emotionally announcing he was in too much pain to carry on in the build up to the first grand slam of the year.After losing to Roberto Bautista-Agut in the first round of the Australian Open, he said: ‘Tonight was not comfortable in terms of my hip. At the end, I’m really struggling, I can’t walk properly at all just now.\u0027I could play another match, but if I want to try to play again, I want to improve my quality of life, because even if I take four months I still can’t walk. I’m still in pain doing just basic day-to-day things.’ But the monumental five-set tussle showed the Scot still has the ability and desire to compete at the top level, and he said he would do everything he could to keep playing. Having the surgery, which happened in London on Monday, means he might not be fit to take part in Wimbledon this summer, where he had planned to say goodbye to the sport.And if it does not allow him to return to the court, he will have played the last game of his glittering career.In the lead up to his operation, he was in constant dialogue with American doubles specialist Bob Bryan, who has just returned to the game following the same procedure last summer.Mr Bryan has said: ‘Seeing the way Andy Murray is feeling hit a nerve with me. I would love to see him do a similar surgery, feel the relief that it gives. I think our hips are pretty similar – just worn down, no cartilage.‘I’m really the only guy to be playing on with a metal hip. So he’s been watching me like a hawk, asking me how I’m feeling after matches, after practices, where I’m at.’    Murray admitted being in pain during the Australian Open this month (pictured there)   A graphic shows how Murray\u0027s hip resurfacing procedure was carried out in hospital Murray had his first hip operation in Australia in January last year. It was carried out by Dr John O’Donnell, who is regarded as one of the leading experts in hip arthroscopy.  Under a resurfacing procedure, damaged bone and cartilage inside a patient’s hip joint are removed and replaced with a metal ‘dome’ surface.Typically patients spend two or three days in hospital and should be walking again soon afterwards.The ATP Tour tweeted support for Murray, posting: ‘Yesterday Andy Murray underwent hip resurfacing surgery in London.

I had no intention to hurt anyone during my design process.\u0027My brand is about girl power, woman power. It\u0027s about attitude with a lot of emotion to the print. So using the goddess went hand in hand.\u0027Not everyone loves it but that\u0027s okay with the creative industry, you either love it or hate it. It would cost me thousands of pounds to take it out of production, something I can\u0027t afford.

Here, Beth Hale reveals the stories behind some of the iconic frocks on show.The creation fit for a princess   She called it her ‘favourite dress of all’.And in the flesh, the fabulous fairytale gown Princess Margaret wore to mark her 21st birthday — both her birthday party in August 1951 and portraits — is indeed a dress of dreams.While the diaphanous skirt is not quite as voluminous as photographs suggest and the colour an off-white rather than the lighter, brighter colour of the famous Cecil Beaton photographs, the dress is the kind of flouncing, bare-shouldered perfection that little girls imagine when they dream of princesses (although Margaret’s father George VI was rumoured to have disapproved of it).          Royal Portrait of Princess Margaret on her 21st birthday by Cecil Beaton in a dress designed by Christian Dior, part of the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition at the London attraction which runs from February 2 to 14 JulyThe differences are not due to any deterioration in fabric, but rather that the colour version of the portrait was actually painted.Even in the Fifties photographers were not averse to a little creative license.With a waist of miniature proportions (no measurement is provided, but it has to be less than 20 inches), the gown shows quite how petite the princess was.Dr Luke says Lady Gaga accused him of rape to win an Oscar...JANET STREET-PORTER: Sorry, Piers but I\u0027m with Will Young -...Could the queen of clean turn me into a domestic god?: MARK...Share this articleMargaret’s son, Lord Snowdon, was at the V\u0026ampA gala dinner to celebrate the exhibition and gave a toast, recalling how surprised he was to find his mother’s dress in the show. He said: ‘I had never seen it before and couldn’t believe that it has survived all these years and been conserved.‘Interestingly, the Cecil Beaton photograph of her shows the dress looking white when in reality it is between cream and beige. It was moving to see the dress that she wore all those years ago with its tiny waist and extraordinary lines, typical of Dior who made such a genius contribution to fashion.’          Princess Diana arrives at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Diana was attending the Museum\u0027s 1996 Costume Insitute gala, a tribute to the achievements of designer Christian DiorLord Snowdon, whose wife Serena was dressed in Dior, added: ‘This is an important exhibition for Britain, with an Anglophile designer who showed such elegance and eloquence in fashion design.’Dior admired Princess Margaret’s style, describing her as ‘so very charming’.‘She was a real fairy princess, delicate, graceful, exquisite,’ he would later write. In 1957, Dior presented the princess with a signed silk scarf in appreciation of her support, while she was a loyal customer for years.Gown almost too daring for Diana It was 1996 and Princess Diana walked into the biggest event on the fashion industry calendar in a dress that was at once ravishing and racy.So racy, in fact, Diana very nearly didn’t wear the dress to New York’s Met Gala for fear Prince William, then 14, wouldn’t like it being so revealing.Brit John Galliano had just been appointed creative director at the fashion house, and designed the dress for Diana before turning his mind to his first collection.A navy silk slip dress, with lace straps and edging, it had more than a hint of the boudoir about it and was a bold choice from Diana, who was then 35.She stopped the fashion crowd dead in their tracks, Liz Tilberis, editor of Harper’s Bazaar, would later write.A statement look for every star  From Margot Fonteyn to Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson, the house of Dior has dressed stars in abundance.At the start they were drawn to the designer’s famed Bar suit — part of his 1947 ‘Corolle’ collection. Crafted from shantung silk, crepe wool and taffeta, it has become one of the brand’s most iconic pieces.  Dior’s successors have continued to dress the brightest stars, including Natalie Portman in Hollywood last year (left) and Nicole Kidman in a beaded gown at Cannes (right)Ballet dancer Dame Margot Fonteyn was one of Christian Dior’s early muses and the exhibition features two dresses she wore, including a 1950 evening gown named ‘Debussy’, made of silk satin with hundreds of dragonfly sequins.Dior’s successors have continued to dress the brightest stars, including Natalie Portman in Hollywood last year.           Naomi Campbell pictured in Dior in 1997There’s also the silk confection Jennifer Lawrence wore to a film premiere in September 2017, a beaded gown worn by Nicole Kidman in Cannes  — and many more.Fashion firebrands who kept his name alive   A string of illustrious names followed in Dior’s footsteps.First came a 21-year-old Yves Saint Laurent, whose early designs were so strikingly similar to his illustrious predecessor that when he sent them to French Elle magazine, the then editor thought it was Dior playing tricks.Next came Marc Bohan — he assumed the helm until 1989.Italian Gianfranco Ferré became the first non-French artistic director, until 1996 when controversial Brit John Galliano took over — supermodel Naomi Campbell is pictured in one of his typically flamboyant designs in 1997.His reign came to a rather ignominious end when he was sacked in 2011, paving the way for Raf Simons and finally Maria Grazia Chiuri, the second Italian and first woman, appointed in July 2016.Anglophile and his blue-blooded fans   Christian Dior first visited the UK in 1926 and was something of an Anglophile. He admired the grandeur of Britain’s great stately homes and gardens, as well as British-designed ocean liners, roast beef and Savile Row suits.Dior’s chic little black suits of the 1940s and 1950s were beloved by the British aristocracy, and muses Nancy Mitford and Margot Fonteyn both ordered his 1947 ‘Daisy’ suit.Mitford wrote to her sister Diana Mosley later that year, of Dior’s second collection: ‘Now I’m nearly 50 I’ve decided to choose a style and stick to it and I choose Dior’s present collection. Simply, to my mind, perfect.’          Christian Dior (left) became an Anglophile after visiting Britain in 1926 and his suits were beloved by the British aristocracy           Charlize Theron has been the face of J\u0027Adore by Dior since 2004‘I adore the English,’ Dior wrote in his memoir.‘I love English traditions, English politeness, English architecture, I even love English cooking!\u0027I dote on Yorkshire pudding, mince pies, stuffed chicken, and above all I worship the English breakfast of tea, porridge, eggs and bacon.’Sweet smell of success    A clever marketer, Christian Dior was a fashion pioneer in more than one respect: he launched a perfume line in 1947, the very same year of his first collection.He very quickly created lipsticks, introduced hats, shoes and even stockings — wanting to provide a ‘one-stop’ service for his well-heeled clients.Latterly, Dior’s perfumes have had a gold theme.In 1999, the fashion house launched J’Adore, a perfume celebrating Christian Dior’s love of glimmering gold.Since 2004, the face of J’Adore has been actress Charlize Theron.The Hollywood beauty has appeared on screen and in print in a series of ever-more dazzling gold gowns, several of which are on display at the V\u0026ampA.They include fashion designer John Galliano’s J’Adore dress from 2008, which was adorned with sequins and Swarovski crystals.Meghan is pretty in peach as she visits the National TheatreWoman shows how to fold clothes using the KonMari methodPaulina Porizkova poses for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit in KenyaDuke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive in Dundee to open V\u0026ampA MuseumMeghan Markle arrives at the National Theatre for royal patron debutDuchess of Sussex leaves National Theatre after official engagementKate Middleton makes a speech and officially opens V\u0026ampA Dundee museumAdorable girl can’t resist touching Kate’s locks in DundeeLittle ladies and gents who attend etiquette lessons graduateChildren perform for The Duchess of Sussex at the National TheatrePolice at scene where man was stabbed to death in IslingtonEx-Labour Fiona Onasanya becomes first female MP to be jailed"},{"url":null,"title":"How litter pick swimsuit","story":"Ghirardelli changes its popular Chocolate Squares packaging...Share this article  TRAVELLING BAGS FROM FIRE HOSES In 2005, Kresse Wesling was at an environmental meeting with the London Fire Brigade when they told her that all their old hoses, which are made of nylon, went to landfill.

President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (left) and the European Chief Negotiator for the United Kingdom Exiting the European Union Michel Barnier (right)Last-ditch negotiations, usually conducted over a weekend when the financial markets were closed, would typically stretch into the early hours.Late-night deals were hatched against a backdrop of TV screens showing central Athens on fire and anti-austerity protesters ripping up flagstones in the capital’s Syntagma Square.The first £38billion bailout was agreed in the dead of night on April 23, 2010, by the troika of the ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund. It was one of several rescue packages for Greece, some of which required a change of government to get them over the line.What happened to Greece is typical of the Eurocrat tendency to fudge, to muddy the waters and eventually to seek compromise in a crisis situation.Indeed, the history of the EU is littered with examples of Britain locked into eleventh-hour talks with eurocrats as the UK has sought changes in our terms of membership.John Major worked through the night in 1991 to secure Britain’s opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty which would have dictated working conditions in Britain and could have undermined the labour market reforms pioneered by his predecessor Margaret Thatcher. Indeed, she was a fierce negotiator in organising rebates from Brussels from the UK’s oversized contributions to the EU budget.In 1984, in the imperial grandeur at the historic palace of Fontainebleau in France, European leaders painfully conceded the famous British EU budget contribution rebate – or, as the French sarcastically called it, ‘le chèque Britannique’.          A new poll reveals voters support May going for talks with the EU but only one in three believe she will be successfulAnd let’s not forget that in the teeth of his promise to hold an inout referendum, David Cameron returned from Brussels in the early hours one day in February 2016 with draft reform proposals agreed by European Council President Donald Tusk which he claimed would give Britain ‘special status’.In the event, the pledges made by Brussels were so anaemic that they failed to convince British voters that sovereignty could be maintained by voting Remain – a huge mistake by the eurocrats who failed to recognise the strength of anti-EU feeling among large swathes of the UK population.Both in national negotiations and in commercial transactions, reaching an accord more often or not comes down to the wire. Today, with the clock ticking inexorably to March 29, the desperation of the leaders of the other 27 EU countries to avoid an economic and financial crisis at the very moment that Germany and the eurozone are facing the bleak prospect of recession may be Theresa May’s best hope.This is regardless of how unyielding Brussels negotiators have been to date and their willingness to play havoc with business confidence and financial stability by its brinkmanship.The potential loss to Brussels of a £39billion one-off payment to a Commission cash-starved following years of economic slowdown, could potentially be a bargaining chip for the Prime Minister in the last-chance saloon.In the final analysis, as veteran witnesses of the late-night sessions in Brussels, Nice, Maastricht and other destinations tell me, it’s mainly Germany and, to a lesser extent, France which decide.Besieged by increasingly hostile populist movements, neither Berlin or Paris will want to make political life tougher than it already is.The politics of the EU, at their most raw, are little different to those of the bazaar. The natural tendency is to relish an aggressive haggle but then to compromise – eventually.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Ups downs life bookshop Chinese store leaves customers stairway literary heaven","story":"    The mirrored ceilings give the illusion of the room never ending much to the amusement of the many hundreds of visitors every day          The stairways which travel up and down, across the rooms, are as attractive to visitors as the thousands of books on the walls          The modern library now attracts as many visitors hoping to photograph it as it does book lovers hoping to find a new read          Photographers stop in the centre to attempt a perfect shot at the bookstore which is packed with optical illusions and even an enchanted mushroom forest for children           Mirrored ceilings give the impression of the book shelves being double the height.

Secondary school...Share this articleThe Ucas data on offers to 18-year-olds in 2018, released today, shows 50 universities made at least 10 per cent of their offers unconditionally.Of those, 22 made such offers to at least 30 per cent, and 10 made them to at least 50 per cent.The highest proportion was at the University of Suffolk, which had 83 per cent unconditional offers.It was followed by York St John, with 78 per cent, and then Bolton, which had 75 per cent.Meanwhile, Roehampton had 68 per cent Southampton Solent had 58 per cent Bishop Grosseteste had 56 per cent and Gloucestershire had 56 per cent.The other universities were Northampton, Lincoln and Plymouth Marjon.Some of these universities specialise in niche subjects such as art and health, which are heavily reliant on portfolios or interviews and do not necessarily require good exam grades.However, many of them also offer mainstream courses in subjects such as English and history.          Happy students: But recent research has shown applicants who accept an unconditional offer are more likely to miss their predicted A Level results by two or more gradesThe data prompted the Office for Students (OfS) to warn universities they must mend their ways.Chief executive Nicola Dandridge said: ‘There are some good reasons why universities might make unconditional offers.‘However, for a number of universities this data will make uncomfortable reading - where they cannot justify the offers they make they should reconsider their approach.’ Among the universities making more than 10 per cent unconditional offers were two elite institutions of the Russell Group - Nottingham and Birmingham.Yesterday, Nottingham announced it would no longer make such offers from this year onwards, following a backlash over the past year.Registrar Dr Paul Greatrix said of the move: ‘We want everyone to be fully confident that they are admitted purely on their merits and potential.’ However, the majority of those favouring unconditional offers were non-elite, ‘low tariff’ universities, which tend to admit lower-performing students.Experts have speculated in the past they may be resorting to these measures to get ‘bums on seats’ if they are less popular and fewer pupils are competing to gain entry.The data released yesterday also showed universities in England were responsible for most of the unconditional offer-making, followed by Wales.It was very uncommon in Scotland, partly because universities do not have to compete for students in the same way, as student numbers are capped and tuition is free.Around half of all unconditional offers had a proviso attached to them - usually that the student had to list the university as their first choice on their Ucas form.When contacted for comment, the University of Suffolk said unconditional offers helped it focus on ‘widening participation’ as it took in the students’ ‘potential to succeed’ in addition to predicted grades.It said it had ‘not adversely affected our applicant profile’ in terms of A-level grades.Meanwhile, Northampton said it ‘does not offer an unconditional place in exchange for an applicant making a decision on the spot’ and ‘explains to all applicants who receive an unconditional offer that their pre-university grades are likely to impact their future career.’ Lincoln said those who receive unconditional offers ‘outperform their peers’, while Plymouth Marjon and Bolton said they had discontinued unconditional offers for 2019."},{"url":null,"title":"PAUL THOMAS negotiating Brussels","story":"Welcome to the 2020 election: One third of the electorate...Smartphone users spend £800million on mobile data they never...Ups and downs of life in a bookshop: Chinese store leaves...Share this article"},{"url":null,"title":"300 000 Thatcher statue 10ft plinth deter vandals","story":"    Artist\u0027s impression: With a 3.2m sculpture atop a 3.2m plinth, the proposed statue would dominate the quiet town square in GranthamA report to South Kesteven District Council states that there is not felt to be a significant threat to the installation of the statue locally.However, it adds: \u0027In general there remains a motivated far-left movement across the UK... who may be committed to public activism.\u0027It still remains that there is a possibility any public statue of Baroness Thatcher would be a likely target for politically-motivated vandals.\u0027The report to members will go before South Kesteven district councillors next Tuesday.Fury as organisers of the London\u0027s Women\u0027s March call female...\u0027Monster of Brussels\u0027 tipped as UK ambassador to be based in...Share this articleIn a bid to avoid the statue being attacked it recommends it should be placed on a \u0027sufficiently high plinth and in easy view.\u0027It states \u0027the statue, to go on St Peter\u0027s Hill, will be placed on a 3.2 metre high plinth, and will be over 6.4 metres tall in total.\u0027St Peter\u0027s Hill is a green space in the heart of Grantham town centre and is already home to a statue of Sir Isaac Newton who attended King\u0027s Grammar School in Grantham.Grantham adopted the statue after plans to build it on Parliament Square, in London, were previously rejected by Westminster City Council due to the fear of it being targeted by protesters.

Here, author and heroine talk about their life-affirming collaboration‘I must tell you a secret,” Lien de Jong’s mother said to her gently one day. “You are going to stay somewhere else for a while.” It was August 1942 in occupied Holland and De Jong was eight years old. The family was Jewish, but not observant. She would never see her parents again they were murdered in Auschwitz six months later. She was sent to live with a non-Jewish family, the Van Eses, the first in a series of temporary homes in the Netherlands’ wartime underground network.Bart van Es is a Dutch-born English literature professor at Oxford University, who usually “writes scholarly books and articles on Shakespeare and Renaissance poetry”. He is also the grandson of Jans and Henk van Es, who, as part of the Dutch resistance, sheltered Jewish children such as Lien de Jong during the occupation. His account of her extraordinary, harrowing story of loss, survival and love, The Cut Out Girl, has just won the Costa Book of the Year award.“I was very amazed,” 85-year-old De Jong says, laughing, the morning after the ceremony. “I thought the young lady would win.”It is true that Rooney’s much-talked-about second novel, Normal People, was the hands-down favourite to take the prize. But The Cut Out Girl was “a hidden gem”, according to Sophie Raworth, chair of the Costa judges. “It was the book we felt everyone should read.”“I think of it as very much a joint book,” Van Es tells De Jong.Arrestingly and simply told, The Cut Out Girl is a powerful addition to memoirs of the Holocaust. It is a whiplash jolt from Rooney’s knowing story of millennial love and angst. “There is something millennial about this, too, in a way,” Van Es suggests. “It’s about modern Europe as well as about the war.” The book interweaves De Jong’s story with Van Es’s travels around the Netherlands – wartime archives, railway and petrol stations, motorways – during which he was struck by the impact of far-right politics there today, with figures such as Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom (PVV) making headlines. “He’s had very significant votes and has really changed the tone of Dutch politics in quite a scary way,” Van Es says.Famed for its tolerance, the Netherlands has “also got its nasty side”. Returning to his grandparents’ house, in what is now an almost entirely Muslim area, he says he felt uncomfortable researching a Jewish story. “It made me think, there’s a danger now that the world is becoming compartmentalised again in echo chambers of people who just tell their own stories. This is a story in one way about a non-Jewish person talking to a Jewish person, but beyond that about a person from the 21st century looking back at the 20th century.” If there is a message to the book, he says, it is that “you have to look beyond yourself, you have to have some larger vision, because in the war the people who acted, who did something for the Jews, were largely people who were part of organisations that ned racial ides, things like my grandparents being part of the socialist movement.”“They were very principled people,” De Jong says. “They didn’t accept injustice in any way.”Although he “always had this sort of background idea, that I’m the family academic and I ought to write this up,” there wasn’t one single trigger that prompted Van Es to begin researching the life of the “lost” Jewish girl who lived with his grandparents during the war, but with whom there was a mysterious rift many years later. He has no memories of De Jong, although she remembers him as a tiny child, and he refers to her as “Aunt” in the book. “I like to say that,” he says, when I ask how they like their relationship to be described.“I never thought about it. You can call me Aunt,” she responds fondly.What was meant to be just a cup of coffee and a sandwich with his “aunt” turned into a 10-hour conversation and then a month-long extended interview, in which he came to know her “in a way that I had never known anybody else. Even with your most intimate contacts, you would never normally say: ‘Tell me your life, your earliest memories what was your room like when you were a little girl?’ It was just an astonishing privilege to have that with another human being. I think that is something that has changed me. It has made me a more empathetic person.”Of their first exchange, De Jong says: “I always thought, ‘I have no special story, so what do you want?’ But talking together, it became a story.”And what a story it is. Her time with the Van Eses, which she refers to as “my first hiding parents”, was a particularly happy one. “That was the only place where I felt safe and could be a child and play with the other children,” she says. But then the knock would come on the door. “It’s funny how much shoes would matter in the time of crisis,” Van Es observes in the book, as she would have to pull on whatever was available and literally run for her life. The succession of hideouts that followed were increasingly unhappy, as she was passed from family to family, treated as a servant in one, and sexually abused in the last. It is striking in the book how De Jong’s memories, so vivid at first, become more vague as she becomes more traumatised. “One of the things the book is about is that you only remember things if you experience them in a community,” Van Es says. Towards the end of the war, De Jong became “almost like a zombie … She lived just in herself, living that was just living she suddenly starts having these enormous gaps where she remembers absolutely nothing.”This, of course, presents something of a challenge to the biographer. And it is here that Van Es pulls off a clever authorial sleight of hand, making De Jong’s story intensely immediate and intimate, only then to concede that she herself can’t recall the details at all. “I wanted to be honest about that,” Van Es explains. “I wanted that sort of trick in the book, so you see it and then you don’t see it. And so I wanted those things to be completely historically correct, which they are. I did research.” For example, during the mass exodus from the village of Bennekom in 1944, a procession of families laden with their belongings, or piled on to carts and wagons, we see the bodies of fly-ridden dead horses and soldiers lying in bomb craters, and are told that De Jong “feels sticky” under the three dresses she is wearing to avoid carrying them. But as Van Es admits: “Of the journey to Ede … she can picture nothing at all.” Instead, he has “patched together” the recollections of the hundreds of others who made the journey, taken either from history books and diaries, or from accounts of people he later interviewed.“So it’s not necessarily Lien wearing three dresses. I will always make it clear that’s a made-up bit.” He wanted it to be not just factually accurate – he even checked the weather reports in newspapers from the time – but also “emotionally true”.How does it feel for De Jong, after all these years, to have the gaps filled in by someone else?“The emotional part is not there anywhere. It’s history for me, the whole story,” she replies. “Sometimes I’m sad about my family, who were lost, all of them most of the time it is in a movie or on TV – just looking at other people I can feel emotion.”Today, she says, she is happy “with my friends and children and grandchildren”. She loves Amsterdam, where she lives, and enjoys being part of its cultural life. “I hope very much that my story can help when we are talking about children who are in a terrible situation these days, without parents or without family, going from one country to another,” she says.On the day of the Dutch publication of the book, which also happened to be De Jong’s 85th birthday, they appeared on a TV chatshow. The discussion centered on two Armenian children who were due to be deported back “home” in two days, despite having spent their whole lives with Dutch foster parents and speaking only Dutch. “It was really shocking that the government was saying: ‘We are going to send these children back,’” says Van Es. The following day a decision was made to allow the children to stay. “I had at least the right to speak,” she says, modestly denying Van Es’s reports that people on Twitter were saying DeJong had done more than those in parliament to help. The book sold out in the Netherlands the next day.Against that background, Van Es recounts stories of extraordinary heroism and desperation: the farmer who cut off part of his finger in order to get paid leave so he could build a secret shelter for children or the couple who turned their food-testing laboratory into a safe house, saving 50 children, with the help of a local doctor, but whose own lives ended in depression and poverty or the family who sheltered in a hideout beneath a tree in a pine forest, breathing by means of a hand-pump connected to the ground above them.But The Cut Out Girl doesn’t end with De Jong’s return to the Van Es household after the war. There can be no uncomplicated happy ending. After a period of stability, in which she married and had three children, De Jong felt like “a cut-out picture of a perfect wife from a magazine”. She became increasingly depressed and isolated from her husband, whose traditional Judaism was “not very meaningful” to her. “I couldn’t live with it,” she says. In 1972, she attempted to kill herself.“I don’t think I had survivor’s guilt,” she reflects. “It was more the idea that I did not – I ought not – to be there. There was nobody who wanted me. When you have no family of your own, and you live with people who can send you away, no connection is unbreakable.”Life healed her, she says: “And the children and my choices. It took time.” At 47, she got orced. “I married a very good man. But he couldn’t come along after a long time. I didn’t know what I wanted.”And then there was another terrible fracture, when Jans van Es – the woman she once called “Ma” – cut her off, the family mystery that is the emotional heart of the book: “Why, at my grandmother’s funeral, was Lien unmentioned and unseen?” Van Es asks. “How could such a connection break?”To answer this would be to give too much away. But the book has been healing for Van Es’s family. His mother, who was terrified about what its revelations might do to her parents’ reputation as brave members of the resistance, has been comforted by its reception. As Van Es says, winning the Costa has been an “incredible confirmation of what was quite a scary enterprise. Quite a lot of people have said they think it’s a kind book. So it was really uniting.”It has also been uniting for his immediate family, in particular for him and his teenage stepdaughter, Josie. De Jong’s experiences of feeling unwanted taught him “how important it is to tell people all the time: ‘You matter to me.’ It gave me a really good chance to talk to Josie. It has been a very meaningful thing for our family.”“Nobody is perfect,” De Jong adds. “We can see in the book that you can be a human being with all your faults and all your good things.” Van Es is already at work on another book, if not closer to home, then closer to his academic interests, on Shakespeare and the novel. And De Jong? “Just going on.”There are so many books already out there about the war, Van Es worries at one point. “There are also so many songs about love,’” De Jong replies.The Cut Out Girl: A Story of War and Family, Lost and Found by Bart van Es (Penguin Books, £9.99).

Neither of them is a natural negotiator or conciliator. These gifts are not part of their skill sets. Of the friendship that can sometimes exist between rival leaders there is no sign. Corbyn’s public sanctimony towards May can make Victor Hugo’s Inspector Javert look like a libertine. May’s default mode towards Corbyn, on show again at question time this week, is to give him her full Lady Disdain.What is more, even if the two leaders wanted to patch something together, their respective Brexit positions do not allow for much common ground anyway. May’s red lines on leaving the single market and the customs union, ending free movement and escaping the jurisdiction of the European court are mostly mirror images of Corbyn’s. He wants a close relationship with the EU market and on customs, and supports his own version of free movement. The only thing that would seem to unite them is that both want Brexit to happen, preferably under a Conservative government.Tuesday’s Commons votes, where Tory MPs rallied around a policy very close to the one they demolished two weeks ago, seem to separate the two leaders still further. Having claimed hers was the only possible deal, May has now pledged to try to change the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement in order to keep her right wing on board. Corbyn, meanwhile, wants her to adopt a soft Brexit approach that would, if she embraced it, trigger a full-scale revolt from her own side and from the Democratic Unionists.For all those reasons and more, the May-Corbyn negotiations seem a sideshow. May has less need of them now. She has regained a bit of control. Her hardliners kept their swords sheathed. The chief whip and the chairman of the Tory backbenchers both played skilful hands, while pro-remain MPs overplayed theirs this time. A second referendum now looks a more distant prospect. All this has won May a reprieve. Given the stunning 230-vote defeat she suffered on 15 January, that is quite a turnaround.But it will not last long. It is not the end of the Brexit battle, and it may not even be the beginning of its end either. May’s characterisation of her majority as “substantial and sustainable” is pure wishful thinking. That is because, as others have argued since Tuesday evening, the vote for the Brady amendment was a vote for something that is both vague and unlikely to happen. The European Union has little incentive to agree to it. And, assuming that it will not happen, certainly not in the small window of time now available, it seems odds-on that May will soon be struggling to find a majority once more.May’s position is neither substantial nor sustainable. It is disjointed and delicate. It bears repeating, after Tuesday’s volte-face, that it was May herself, not the EU, who created the all-UK backstop that she is now seeking to unpick. But the deeper truth, which she must have known when she originally agreed to it in 2017, is that the backstop was an attempt to reconcile three promises that are almost impossible to fit together in one consistent policy.The first of these is May’s promise to leave the customs union, which she made because she knows that the Thatcherite right of her party, including some of the most fanatical long-term advocates of Brexit, attaches immense importance – though it was barely mentioned in 2016 – to an autonomous trade policy. The second is her promise to Ireland, which in law and by treaty she is duty bound to make, that a new trade regime would not cause the creation of a hard border of any kind. And the third is the promise she made to the DUP after the 2017 election that she would not permit customs and regulatory ergence between Britain and Northern Ireland.These three promises are mutually contradictory. That was the case before Tuesday and it is still true now. You can’t have an autonomous trade policy and an open border. That is why the backstop exists at all. It is there to ensure that the open border in Ireland remains in force in the face of May’s commitment, driven by her right wing, to a sovereign trade policy. These unavoidable truths are not going to go away just because May and Graham Brady managed to find a form of words about “alternative arrangements” that pulled the Tory party back from an outright split after the 15 January vote against the deal.This brings us back to the role that Corbyn may yet play. For most of the parliamentary Brexit process, Corbyn has been a large but inert presence. Brexit politics has happened around him, not with or through him. He remains content, it seems, to go through the motions but not to get his hands dirty. Up to a point, it has been a coherent strategy if your three priorities, like Corbyn’s, are for Brexit to happen, for the Tories to own it, and for your own pristine politics to remain unsullied by the most important argument facing the country.In the end, though, events may be propelling Corbyn to mix with the sweatier end of politics. One pressure is that backbenchers in his party – such as Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn – have emerged as de facto Labour figureheads. Another is that May has begun to engage with workplace and environmental regulatory issues that Labour cares about. Crucially, May’s defeat two weeks ago and her current turn to the Tory right are highlighting the harsh reality of the Brexiter trade autonomy dream that she has now empowered. A more adept Labour leader would have been reaching out relentlessly to Tory moderates over recent months on the customs elements of the eventual UK-EU trade deal, searching for common ground and looking for ways to ensnare them in a shared commitment to the open borders and regulatory alignment that the hard Brexiters so loathe.Such a thing may yet happen anyway. If May fails to get the changes from the EU that she seeks, and if this week’s Tory party unity comes under strain, as it may, then a space could open up for a softer Brexit deal. Such a deal has always been the least worst viable outcome to Brexit. This week’s events have underscored more than ever why May’s deal and no deal need not be the only options. Even Corbyn must see what is now at stake, and why engaging seriously with May is overwhelmingly in the country’s interest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4db79c095d59f8281cdd4a23bbfe778ff7fc8ad/0_200_5150_3091/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14fccb7c11bd7a878d1450e743e73ab9","title":"education clarks shoes tory shop child development","story":"The government’s proposal that shop workers should help kickstart children’s early development is laughableParents, we’ve all been there: a high-street shoe shop in early September. Everyone with a school-aged child has simultaneously realised that if they don’t get around to buying shoes today, the kids are going to have to start the year wearing flip-flops, or wellies. The queue is out of the door, heaps of small black lace-ups litter the aisles. Babies are wailing. Somebody’s toddler has got a foot stuck in the measuring machine. It’s too hot in the store, and there’s a heady scent of sweat and wee. Your own children are desperate to leave because you rashly bribed them to come here with the promise of a trip to the Lego shop and a doughnut.How, you may wonder, could this annual ritual get any more hellish? As ever, the government is one step ahead: it has come up with the brilliant wheeze of training staff in Clarks shoe shops to “engage children in conversation” with the aim of “improving language skills”. We are assured that this initiative will be up and running by the summer, in time for the pre-school rush. The children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi has explained that “by working with a growing number of businesses, charities and experts, we’re making it easier for parents to kickstart early development”.Really, where do they come up with this stuff? One can only imagine that Zahawi has never been into Clarks during the pre-school rush. If he had, he would know that there is no less suitable educational environment, and the only thing this initiative will help parents to develop is a stress-related migraine. Anyone aware of the cost of Clarks shoes – a typical full-price pair will set you back at least £30 – would also be aware that the chain is not, perhaps, quite the environment in which to engage parents or children from disadvantaged backgrounds.Let’s give our esteemed leaders the benefit of the doubt, however, and assume that somewhere deep within this misguided plan there is a good intention. The government is, quite rightly, concerned about the rates of literacy in the UK, citing the figure that 7.1 million adults have very poor literacy skills, and that rates of early literacy are particularly low among disadvantaged families. There is also plenty of evidence to support the argument that this is not just an issue for schools child from a family in which parents are confident and communicative has a better chance of developing good speech and language skills.But the idea that a shop assistant can provide any kind of meaningful support to parents during a harried interaction in which they are also trying to buy shoes is just laughable. What parents – especially disadvantaged parents – need is proper investment in early-years education. A 2010 evaluation of the Sure Start initiative found that children’s centres, which offered consistent, high-quality expert support, could have a positive influence on the home-learning environment and on parenting more generally. Buts many as 1,000 children’s centres have closed down since 2010, and many of those that are left offer only a fraction of the services they once did. These centres, which were much-loved and so critical to any prospect of social mobility, have been the first thing to go for many cash-strapped local authorities. As have libraries, another crucial source of free support with literacy and communication – almost 130 of them have closed in the last year alone.It’s easy to see the appeal of this scheme, which creates the illusion of commitment to social mobility while costing the government nothing. The cherry on the cake is that the private sector stands to benefit in the form of excellent PR for Clarks and the other businesses involved. But as we parents stand in those stuffy, slow-moving queues next September, listening to sales staff deliver their educational message while we attempt to pacify our restless children with Haribo, perhaps we will be forgiven a hollow laugh.• Alice O’Keeffe is a literary critic and journalist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9de971cba2aa774485a77915c32fdf488ef2839a/0_70_3820_2292/master/3820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a3ab346c88e5a62b3c287d1f9290bbf","title":"labour not responsible brexit tories","story":"This week’s parliamentary votes on Brexit should mark the death of a delusion. This may seem an odd argument: parliament has just voted for an amendment demanding an alternative to the backstop, which has been repeatedly ruled out by the EU. Tory MPs voted for what they know is impossible. David Lidington, the prime minister’s number two, who three weeks ago denounced “fantasies about magical, alternative deals”, voted for what he knows is impossible. Theresa May, who has repeatedly declared that no alternative to her deal exists and then ludicrously whipped her MPs to vote against that deal, voted for what she knows is impossible. The DUP, which at least has the excuse of being stranded in the 17th century, voted for what it knows is impossible. The Tory party is subjecting the country to a pantomime, acting out a script it knows bears no relation to reality, and is prolonging Britain’s turmoil and our international humiliation, all for the sake of its own partisan interests.No, the delusion that died last night was the idea that Labour has any meaningful say over the substance of Brexit at all. Labour put forward an amendment to strike out no deal, and to provide the option of a second referendum. It backed Yvette Cooper’s amendment to extend article 50 by a mere three months and Dominic Grieve’s amendment to allow consultative votes on alternatives to May’s Brexit plan. All three of the amendments were voted down in parliament. The reason for this is that the Tories have a parliamentary majority, courtesy of the DUP, and Tory MPs – wherever they stand on the Brexit ide – prioritise stopping a party split over the nation’s interests. Along with their ideological obsession with austerity, this is the proximate cause of Britain’s crisis. This should be a statement of the obvious, but sometimes to state the obvious is a revolutionary act.And yet, for some, an opposition party with only a minority of parliamentary seats shares responsibility. Ire is directed at Labour because 14 rebels voted against Cooper’s amendment. For some reason, the leadership is to blame for just over a dozen of its backbenchers defying instructions and rebelling. There really does need to be more consistency in the attack lines directed at Jeremy Corbyn. Is he an authoritarian leader who has subjected the Labour party to a Stalinist reign of terror, leaving MPs in fear of local party members democratically choosing to select another candidate? Or has he imposed insufficient discipline on his MPs? Which is it? As it happens, it has been repeatedly reported that a key reason many rightwing Labour MPs have not declared for May’s deal is because of pressure from Momentum and the threat of deselection. Are Corbyn’s critics now demanding that this pressure should be intensified?If people are angry about the Brexit mess – which they really should be – that fury should be directed at the decisions of the Tory government, decisions voted for and endorsed by virtually every single Tory MP. Let’s look at some so-called Tory rebels. When Jo Johnson resigned from the government over Brexit, he was hailed as a hero of the remain cause and cheered at a People’s Vote rally, where he was interviewed by national treasure Gary Lineker. Yesterday , Johnson voted against the Cooper amendment and against Tory Caroline Spelman’s non-binding amendment to stop a no deal, and abstained on Grieve.Or take Grieve himself, who last year tabled an amendment on a meaningful vote and then voted against it. Or Nicky Morgan, who colluded with Jacob Rees-Mogg to hammer out an unworkable “compromise” that merely makes no deal more likely. Or Anna Soubry, who voted against the right of EU citizens to remain, and declared that she would choose Britain leaving the EU under a Tory government over remaining under a Corbyn government. Time after time, Tory “rebels” have proved themselves charlatan and dupes. Why, then, do some remainers have limitless gullibility when it comes to Tory “rebels” but equally bottomless incredulity when it comes to Labour’s motives?Take Yvette Cooper, who distributed leaflets pledging that she would “not vote to block Brexit”. We are right to condemn Brexiteers for making promises they could not keep during the referendum campaign. But why then demand Labour MPs break their own promises? If Corbyn ordered his MPs to vote for a second referendum, a big chunk of his parliamentary party would rebel, and it would not pass. People’s Vote campaigners have been demanding that Labour commit to a position that would provoke mass resignations from the party’s frontbench, a huge parliamentary rebellion, anger its leave voters, and then still get voted down. For some, the motive is a passionate commitment to a legitimate cause. For others, such as Chuka Umunna, it’s about driving a wedge between Labour’s leadership and its members and voters so that a new “centrist” party can be founded.That doesn’t mean Labour should be absolved of criticism. It has failed to forcefully make the case for immigration, even though key leadership figures – Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott, and John McDonnell – have committed their political lives to pro-migrant and refugee campaigns. Labour nearly abstained on the Tories’ immigration bill on Monday, which would have been scandalous. But to claim that Labour shares the responsibility for Brexit turmoil is completely unfounded. If this week’s parliamentary votes underline anything, it is this: Tory rule is the source of our nation’s ills, and until it is ended our country is damned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9be73f3b80e7be3d4b1c3c19cf74a54bfcd63944/0_50_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcf79d4f2c3cadd71a832192fcefd25b","title":"meghan kate women social media twitter instagram","story":"Kensington Palace has asked Twitter and Instagram for help, but online abuse affects everyone – especially minority womenBeing a royal secures unfathomable perks. Whether it’s getting a £1m home refurbishment gifted by the taxpayer, ownership of all the swans or a lifetime of inherited privilege for you and your descendants, royal status shields the bestowed from life’s mundane troubles. But even a five-metre Givenchy wedding veil couldn’t save Meghan, Duchess of Sussex from misogynoir and a barrage of trolling.This week, Kensington Palace had to reach out for help from Twitter and Instagram, as staff members were spending hours each week reporting sexist and racist comments and threats aimed at Meghan and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge. The diatribe is so dire that Hello! magazine has started a campaign #HelloToKindness.Being a woman in public life is not without challenge. Female MPs, athletes and actors are subjected to abuse on and offline. And both Kate and Meghan have been the targets of sexist criticism on the Kensington Palace platforms and in tabloid comment sections. But it should surprise no one that there has been a spike in hateful comments in October and November, following the announcement of Meghan’s pregnancy.Although a strongly worded letter from Prince Harry in 2016 had put the tabloid media on pause, the reality of a more-melanin-infused royal baby joining the House of Windsor has unleashed the hounds once more. Meghan’s crimes since have been numerous travesties that include cupping her baby bump in public and painting her fingernails. Kate cupped her bump on numerous occasions to no comment. “Sources” also claim Meghan is “high maintenance”, “demanding” and “made Kate cry”.Meghan isn’t the first royal to be hounded by the press and criticised frequently. Diana, Princess of Wales was never far away from a front page and faced intense scrutiny. She was also read as a rebel who didn’t follow protocol. But Meghan has the added bonus of being biracial, which brings with it a different type and intensity of abuse.Social media doesn’t cause online abuse but it is a conduit for societies’ baser beliefs. Online trolling of Meghan and Harry has included six knife emojis and claims that Meghan has bleached her skin to look whiter. A Daily Mail headline referred to her as being from a “gang-scarred” home and “(almost) straight outta Compton”. Comments on the Kensington Palace Instagram called her “trashy” and “ghetto”. Like the recent Sunday Times article that referred to the two schools in “gangland” – known to the rest of us as Newham, east London, where the 2012 Olympics were held – that got a number of black teenagers Oxbridge places, the media, and the trolls that follow them, will associate black people with gangs and crime for the most tenuous of reasons.Racism and sexism are social problems. But social media companies could do more to help protect their users. Celebrities and charities such as Amnesty and Glitch UK are left to campaign for change. After a fortnight of news on self-harm, suicides and Katie Price taking a stand for her disabled son, it’s high time they responded seriously to the abuse perpetuated on their platforms. Otherwise, they risk putting off a generation of women, particularly minority women, from entering public life. All communities need some norms, values and standards to make them safe.

The line that ides pro-Europeans and Brexiters cannot be neatly drawn between opposition and governing benches. MPs on both sides have been frustrated by their leaders and defied their whips. But, overall, party bonds have proved remarkably resilient.The slender majority that Theresa May won on Tuesday night, endorsing a theoretical variant of her Brexit deal (minus the Northern Irish backstop), was a case in point. Mrs May had some Labour votes on loan and was as reliant as ever on the DUP, but the determining factor was a Conservative craving to feel whole again after months of civil strife. Many Tory MPs know that the proposition they endorsed was a fiction. The prime minister herself conceded that there was little appetite in the EU to adjust the backstop. Ministers are unable to describe the “alternative arrangements” that are supposed to prevent any return to a hard Irish border. But those technical problems were set aside for the gratification of appearing unified at last.That pretence does not come without cost. There are 27 EU member states whose different interests have been painstakingly funnelled into one withdrawal agreement with the UK. For Mrs May to change her mind about it now, two months before departure day, is not just reckless, it is obnoxious. Governments around the world are watching for signs of what kind of actor “Brexit Britain” will be on the international stage. Previously Mrs May looked obtuse. Now she looks unreliable.The prime minister has often faced a choice between confronting an intransigent strain of Tory anti-Brussels prejudice and indulging it. Each time she has flattered the fanatics. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris it is apparent that the rightwing fringe of the Conservative party harbours nationalistic hostility to the European project, and that some Tory MPs see a purgative value in the chaos that would follow a disorderly collapse of the Brexit process. That wrecking impulse is present within the majority that swung behind Mrs May in the Commons on Tuesday. The Eurosceptic ultras do not expect satisfaction from a renegotiated deal. On the contrary, they make demands in order to mine grievance from the inevitable rejection. They backed the prime minister in preparation for the blame game that will doubtless begin when Brexit fails to deliver its advertised bounties.Mrs May’s tolerance of that faction costs her credibility and goodwill with European partners who also watched David Cameron being manipulated by the same Tory backbenchers with the same incapacity for compromise. Even if the EU27 want to help the prime minister, they know their concessions would simply provoke more demands. There is no interest for the EU side in pandering to the implacables. Mrs May has done so partly because she lacks a Commons majority but that is not a sufficient explanation. For her not once to have challenged the hardliners after all this time suggests a cultural affinity that goes beyond calculation and cowardice. It indicates a sense of belonging – an irrational loyalty that supersedes the call of serious statecraft.Most politicians imagine themselves capable of putting country before party in moments of emergency. That patriotic ambition has rarely been tested as thoroughly or as visibly as it is now with a prime minister who buys transient, worthless moments of Tory unity at a heavy price in national credibility. It is a shameful transaction and one for which Mrs May and the Conservatives will one day be held to account."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d670a8e8dd667a2ea5eaedbb996b84c867f4c938/0_13_3073_1844/master/3073.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026amp;s=8de07b313ac66d6fc97790135875ad2e","title":"my canadian food odyssey by chef john quilter","story":"On his six-week journey from east to west Canada, chef John Quilter – AKA The Food Busker – finds a salt beef sandwich that’s 10 days in the making, a killer craft beer brewed with foraged herbs and the best Chinese meal outside of ChinaFor many years, Canada has rented a room in my thoughts, ever since I worked there as a young chef. I spent a summer season in the kitchen of a restaurant in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, when I was 18 and had the time of my life. The people, the countryside, the food, I loved it all, and I’ve longed to go back ever since. Last year, I finally returned on an epic six-week food tour of the country.When you think of Canada, I guess you think of mountains, forest, and bears, right? That’s only half the story, but it’s true: the country has a vast natural beauty on a scale we just don’t see in Europe. As I travelled all over, Canada’s vistas constantly stopped me in my tracks. Just when you think you have seen it all – “Nothing, surely, can top Lake Louise, this has to be Canada’s most breathtaking spot!” – two days later you’re on a ranch in Alberta, riding a stallion, hearing about a cougar or a grizzly bear sighting nearby. Canada makes you look at the world through the eyes of a child. Constantly fascinated, completely immersed.The wildlife I expected, what I was not prepared for was how vibrant and unique Canada’s cities are, and the rich foodie scene that each deserves to be proud of.Time and time again I experienced cultural centres humming and sparkling with the day-to-day life of food shopping, eating out or grabbing a coffee. I was astonished and delighted by the quality of the markets and shops, and Canada’s incredibly strong field-to-plate movement, which ensures the freshest, tastiest raw ingredients. Below are a few of my culinary highlights from the trip.Montréal is a befuddling enclave of Francophone culture in this mainly English-speaking country. The city practically fizzes with fierce French passion and values, which you can’t help but be charmed by. I fell in love with its French-style model economy of independent boulangerie, boucher and pâtisserie.Montréal to me was more than just foodie heaven, it was a blueprint for how a city could be. It’s a city that cares about the little things, such as bookshops, delicatessens, decent coffee and croissants the provenance of goods, and the importance of heritage. Montréal is full of independent shops that have been around for generations. From opening their doors every morning to closing at night, they are committed to the simple idea of creating just one thing of value – a coffee or a salt beef sandwich – and taking enjoyment and pride in the “means”.The aforementioned perfect salt beef sandwich was enjoyed at one of Montréal’s ultimate foodie landmarks, Schwartz’s. The smoked-meat experts have been trading on Saint-Laurent Boulevard since 1928, when established by Jewish immigrant Reuben Schwartz. Unlike many places, Schwartz’s still smokes its meat the old-fashioned way: with a 10-day marinade and then an eight-hour smoke before it’s sliced in front of your eyes. Frank Silva, the manager, has worked here since he was a boy, something I found time and again in Montréal. In an age when there is often little customer or staff loyalty to establishments, I found it truly enchanting.The city also lays claim to the world’s best bagel – or, rather, two of the world’s best. Locally, it is considered an undisputed fact that you won’t find a better bagel than the ones made here, but the jury is very much out over which Montréal institution is superior: St-Viateur Bagel or Fairmont Bagel. Some favour St-Viateur for the honey water they boil their bagels in, while Fairmont is so in demand it stays open 24 hours a day. Both, to me, were perfection – yet another example of the city’s impassioned, artisanal approach to food.Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, has a kicking live music scene, along with a fabulous market culture. The city’s Seaport Farmers’ Market on the waterfront is the oldest continuously operating farmers’ market in North America, the hub for a long list of cheese makers, fruit and vegetable producers, and wine growers from the plentiful farms in the nearby Annapolis valley. At the stall for That Dutchman’s Cheese Farm, I sampled Dragon’s Breath – one of the stinkiest, creamiest, most kick-ass blue cheeses you could imagine.But it is Halifax’s craft beer scene that rivals anything I’ve seen anywhere else. At the Good Robot Brewing Co, the female brew team of Erica Fraser and Kelly Costello create beers with locally foraged herbs and medicinal plants. The list of brews is extensive – on reflection, I may have investigated it a little too thoroughly.And the restaurants also punch way above their weight. I found classic comfort food at 2 Doors Down, where the braised Prince Edward Island beef short rib is knockout, while Halifax’s privileged coastal position also makes it a hotspot for seafood.Ontario in east-central Canada is the province I have spent the most time in over the years, since working here as a teen, and it still feels like a home away from home. Capital city Toronto is such an enthralling city, with so much going on. What sets it apart from other cities is the sheer wealth of its ethnic communities happily living and eating together. It is one of the world’s most multicultural cities – in fact, a survey by BBC Radio named it the most erse, ahead even of London. Just over half of its residents are foreign-born, hailing from 230 different nationalities. This shows in the food scene, a heavyweight collection of authentic ethnic cuisines alongside young chefs developing and modernising traditional flavours.Here, I had stand-out Indian and Vietnamese, while Mexican food is on the rise in a big way. My favourite restaurant, and the one that sums this all up, was Snack Bar 416 (pictured above). A small hipster joint near bohemian Kensington Market, it uses all the city’s main ethnic communities as inspiration, taking one hero dish from each cuisine. Often when this pick-and-mix approach is attempted it falls flat on its face, with compromise and inexperience resulting in bland creations. Not here, not in Toronto.One of the best ways to take the culinary temperature of a city is to see how its various establishments serve brunch. I hit two spots and became addicted to Chambar on the edge of Gastown, the hipster area of the city, and the waffle heaven of Medina, which served incredible dishes with imagination and attention to detail. And then came the holy grail: a killer cup of coffee. Revolver, again in Gastown, is the coffee shop St Peter would open outside the pearly gate. Trust me.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/597305e020ab2ad32cb503da49f25aff335f0cf4/0_432_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a048cd5a81fdd7e6e30a6f0caf192af1","title":"the lowdown on nova scotia canadas seaside paradise","story":"Sandy beaches, snug harbours and (possibly) the best lobster roll in the world.

Enjoy the Oceanstone Resort’s Ultimate Lobster Feast and Peggy’s Cove Adventure, where the resort’s executive chef guides you as you choose your own lobster from Ryer’s Lobster Pound, and after experiencing Peggy’s Cove and craft beer tasting, feast on lobster at sunset.In September, Halifax hosts the FIN: Atlantic International Film Festival celebrating both local and international film-makers. Then, in October, 150 musicians, comedians and speakers come together for the Halifax Pop Explosion, showcasing emerging music and art. A popular draw in the summer, the Halifax Jazz Festival, the oldest in Atlantic Canada, attracts some of the best musicians in the world to a city-wide extravaganza.One of Nova Scotia’s most famous artists is Maud Lewis (played by Sally Hawkins in the award-winning 2016 film Maudie), many of whose naïve, child-like paintings depict rural Nova Scotia. Her work is on display at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia. The province is also home to a rich and erse cultural heritage, including Mi’kmaq and First Nations, African Nova Scotian, Acadian and Celtic and Gaelic peoples, all of whom have shaped Nova Scotia’s story.There are many museums dotted around the province that bring to life the story of all these peoples. You can find out about African Nova Scotians at the Black Loyalist Heritage Centre in Birchtown on the South Shore – it takes visitors through the journey of early black settlers in Nova Scotia. And discover the history of the Acadian people – descendants from the French settlers – at the Grand-Pré national historic site and at Le Village Historique Acadien de la Nouvelle-Écosse. While, the Highland Village Museum is a living history museum and cultural centre that celebrates the Gaelic experience in Nova Scotia.The Bay of Fundy boasts the highest tides in the world – around 16 metres – and thanks to the Tidal Bore Rafting Resort you can – literally – ride that wave. The Shubenacadie River (don’t worry, the locals just call it “Shubie”) is known for its beauty and for regular sightings of bald eagles. Unforgettably, you can enjoy a seafood and wine tasting on a sandbar before 160bn tonnes of water fill up the estuary.Kejimkujik national park and national historic site is a special place to experience the outdoors with great camping, canoeing and hiking opportunities.

Save a few days to drive around and enjoy the cultural heritage sites and scenic coastal viewpoints. Leave time, though, to hike one of the many trails such as Skyline or Franey in the national park for glimpses of moose, bald eagles and other wildlife.While summer and autumn are the most popular times to visit, there’s plenty to enjoy all year round. The White Point Beach Resort is one of Nova Scotia’s four-season jewels. Enjoy the miles of pure white sand beach in the summer and cozy up to an inviting fireplace next to windows overlooking the ocean during the winter. June to September is whale-watching season head to Brier Island or Cape Breton for the best views.Many trails are open year-round, such as Rogart Mountain Trail in Earltown, ideal for winter snowshoeing and summer hiking.

They cut out paper starfish – more formally known as sea stars – and put them up for “adoption” for a $1 donation. They assigned them names and personality traits, such as Cherry Bomb, who “loves hanging out on her phone”, “rocks the legging style” and “is really smart but isn’t a nerd”. They sold T-shirts that read: “Save the Starfish.”“We don’t have an ocean anywhere close by,” their now retired teacher Vickie Bailey said. “The students knew that they would never go to the coast, they would probably never get to see this type of starfish, but they were so passionate about what was happening.”When Drew Harvell, a marine ecology professor and researcher at Cornell University, received the $400 or so that Carl Stuart middle school in Conway collected, she knew the money should go to something important.“I almost cried, I was so touched. So I matched it with $400 of my own and then one of our donors here put in a bigger amount of money and that’s basically the funding that allowed us to do the initial survey,” Harvell said.Flash forward to today: Harvell and her co-authors are releasing their study inspired by the seed money from the kids. Cornell and the University of California, Davis, are publishing their work in the journal Science Advances.The campaign didn’t exactly save the starfish. The findings are dire. But researchers now know much more about the scope of the die-off after analyzing data from trained recreational and professional ers and deep offshore trawls.Sea star wasting disease has affected more than 20 species from Mexico to Alaska. Some species resisted the disease better and others have evolved to survive.At the time of the outbreak, videos showed beaches littered with the arms of dead starfish, internal organs spilling out through lesions, Harvell recalled.The effect has been particularly bad for the sunflower star, a 3-4ft-wide creature that can have as many as two dozen arms. The sunflower star “crawls over the seafloor like a robotic vacuum cleaner, munching on everything in its path”, as described by Cornell’s media team.Sunflower sea stars, which live only on the west coast of North America, are now virtually gone from the waters off California, Oregon and Washington.Previous research has suggested that with warmer temperatures linked to climate change, the wasting disease has a higher risk of infection and kills sea stars faster. The new study finds that outbreaks of the virus among sunflower sea stars coincided with anomalously warm waters.And the disappearance of the species is having cascading effects on the ecosystem.Sunflower sea stars once kept the sea urchin population under control, but now urchin numbers are exploding, leading to barrens where they have devoured kelp habitats down to the pink sea floor beneath them.While the species is imperiled in the lower 48, they’re doing a little better in British Columbia and in some places in Alaska, Harvell said. Researchers will need to understand whether the sunflower sea star can be repatriated if the disease ever leaves west coast waters.“It’s really vital that something be done,” Harvell said. “It’s not an issue that we’ve dealt with before so I don’t have an immediate suggestion of what we would do. I think that we definitely need to convene a group of scientists and really talk about the issue and what are the highest priority items.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eee738bcb6e1a3de6aaf2336e07417239bfa0d48/0_2702_4437_2660/master/4437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=858fd515721bd534c4e58abfa6a589bf","title":"selfie v shelfie fashion interiors backdrops clothes online brands home accessories decor","story":"Eye-catching backdrops are now just as considered as the clothes we pose in online – and more fashion brands are branching into home accessories and decor Forget about athleisure, ugly trainers and logomania, the most dominant trend to have gripped the masses in recent years isinteriors. The fashion world is currently consumed by a homeware obsession – making the “shelfie” the new selfie.It’s not a hard trend to hunt down. On social media, aesthetically pleasing backgrounds now get at least as much attention as the outfits we post photographs of. Elsewhere on our feeds, Peggy Guggenheim’s terrazzo-tiled palazzo in Venice, the quiet sophistication of Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge and the sugary millennial-pink interior of the tea room at Sketch in London are just as likely to be pictured as a new pair of shoes. The hashtag #IHaveThisThingWithTiles has become as commonplace as #TodayI’mWearing, while Le Corbusier is the new Calvin Klein and Charlotte Perriand the new Prada.“It’s a natural extension of accessorising in fashion in the way you might buy something to cheer an outfit up the equivalent is buying a cushion for your sofa or a vase for your mantlepiece,” says Vogue’s fashion features editor, Ellie Pithers. She too credits Instagram for the rate at which we are consuming images of people’s houses, hence increasing our appetite for interiors (witness the Italian fashion brand Bottega Veneta this week releasing its spring 2019 campaign, in which the chrome and snakeskin chair the model sat on stole the show). “The next stage of showing off your good taste is extended to your house.”The new offering from Asos – which self-identifies as “a global fashion destination for 20-somethings” – promises to work, says Pithers, because it is targeting young trend-driven shoppers who don’t have a lot of space or money. “They haven’t focused on big furniture, because their customers are students who don’t have big flats.” Instead, they can “buy a standard sofa from Ikea then beautify it with lots of nice little bits”, such as placing a wicker wastepaper basket, a printed plate or a water jug nearby. River Island’s bestsellers so far – a coaster, a planter and a leopard-print mug –chime with this psychology.That the popularity of interiors has coincided with the rise of the Swedish H\u0026ampM group on the high street is no coincidence. The group capitalised on the mid-century Scandinavian aesthetic – one of the most prevailing interiors trends of this century – by bottling the formula, firstly through its H\u0026ampM Home brand and then with Arket, which launched in 2017. “Arket has been clever,” says Pithers. “The way they have the homewares by the till. Instead of buying a chocolate bar on the way out of the newsagent, you’re buying a little vase or a pack of matches that doesn’t cost very much and cheers you up.”When it comes to fashion, quick-fix, fast interiors are the new food for thought.

Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney).

The key to its Dark Universe surely lies in the hands of emerging talentIf the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes down in film history as a textbook example of how to build a perfect spider-web of interconnected movies, with each new arrival in multiplexes enriching and adding nuance to those that came before, Universal’s recently deceased “Dark Universe” will surely be remembered as the exact opposite: a cinematic end of line, full stop, dead end.The rumblings that this one might have breathed its last breath – before it ever really emerged from a thousand-year slumber to embark on a reign of terror – were there from the beginning. After the studio released a weird-looking shot of Tom Cruise (star of The Mummy) with Johnny Depp (the Invisible Man), Russell Crowe (Dr Jekyll) and Javier Bardem (Frankenstein’s monster) in 2017, it emerged that the image had in fact been put together via composite techniques. Even the A-list actors themselves clearly weren’t confident enough in the future of the franchise to find the time to be properly photographed together.Later that month, The Mummy bombed critically (though it eventually grasped its way to a not-completely terrible $410m worldwide), leading the rest of those remakes to being quietly locked back in the crypt. Until now, that is. For the Hollywood Reporter suggests Universal is resurrecting its plans for The Invisible Man – sans Depp, and with no plans to have the heavily bandaged monstrosity hang out with his monster buddies, Abbott and Costello-style, in future movies this time around.This can only be a good thing. The studio’s concoction Prodigium, a Dark Universe agency equivalent to Marvel’s SHIELD, complete with green-faced Russell Crowe presumably hamming it up in every movie as JekyllHyde, always looked as clumsily stitched together as Frankenstein’s monster himself. Moreover, the star-focused model for the franchise rather ignored the fact that it is pretty difficult to create a gothic mist of suspense when the key protagonists are among Hollywood’s most famous faces … and we all know they are guaranteed to make it to the end credits.The presence of Cruise and Crowe in The Mummy unbalanced Alex Kurtzman’s film so severely that it was nearly impossible to recall that this was a film ostensibly designed to chill the spine, so comic were its hamfisted attempts at knockabout action thrills and mega-movie world-building.Perhaps Universal’s determination to throw a little star power into the mix was predicated on the studio’s own insecurities, for most of the original titles that spawned the classic monster movies of the 1930s are long out of copyright in the US. If another studio wants to make a movie version of HG Wells’s The Invisible Man, it is perfectly entitled to do so, though that studio may not be able to persuade Johnny Depp to get on board.Nobody yet knows who will be stepping into Claude Rains’s shoes in the new version, but the spirit of James Whale’s original 1933 film and Wells’s source novel surely require that it be an unknown, or at the very least not an instantly recognisable face. Universal has recruited Insidious and Saw’s Leigh Whannell to direct, and it’s clear the studio sees this as a new start with a very different approach to its ill-fated previous plans.“Throughout cinematic history, Universal’s classic monsters have been reinvented through the prism of each new film-maker who brought these characters to life,” said the studio’s president of production, Peter Cramer. “We are excited to take a more inidualised approach for their return to screen, shepherded by creators who have stories they are passionate to tell with them.”Let us hope Universal really can wrap its latest efforts up in a veil of eerie enigma this time around, rather than batter us around the chops with corny action cliches. If the studio wants to bring its most infamous horror icons back from the dead, it had better make sure to inject them with some real creative electricity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/647cc4c60a6ed91ee4d923b6eafb3c3e2f194740/155_173_1378_827/master/1378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43bff91ae7f5d58a92986dc781728713","title":"green book review mahershala ali viggo mortensen peter farrelly","story":"Mahershala Ali plays a jazz musician who confronts the racism of his driver, played by Viggo Mortensen, in a warm but tentative real-life storyMahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are two excellent actors outclassing their material in this amiable, feelgood entertainment, inspired by a true story. Mortensen plays Tony Vallelonga, a 1960s nightclub bouncer from New York who got a job as personal driver and minder to African-American jazz musician Don Shirley (Ali) on a tour through the Jim Crow south – armed with the “green book”, a guide to hotels and restaurants hospitable to black people.The movie, in fact, has its own green book, negotiating subjects and areas where it needs to tread carefully. Class and race aren’t the only issues – there is also sexual identity, which the film touches on once and then moves on without the principals ever saying a word about it.In real life, Tony became a show business figure, acting in Goodfellas and The Sopranos he died in 2013 and his son Nick is this film’s producer and co-screenwriter, with Peter Farrelly directing. It’s a standard-issue heartwarmer, a liberal whiteblack tale like Driving Miss Daisy or the recent The Upside. (There are some eerily close resemblances to the latter film, including a moment in which the servant must teach the master about Aretha Franklin.)Tony’s job is to cure Don of his snobbery and emotional frigidity, and Don must cure Tony of his racism and ignorance – although this half of the equation is fudged. In an initial scene, Tony puts a couple of glasses in the bin because his wife has let two black workmen drink out of them. But the level of fanatical racism that this implies pretty much vanishes when Tony meets Don. So their road trip to self-discovery begins, and we hold our breath for when the white good-ol’-boy racists inevitably show up, or for when Shirley wishes to use the white bathroom at those grand places where he has been booked to play.Vallelonga’s nickname is “Tony Lip” he tells Shirley this is because of his reputation as a bullshitter. Shirley’s surviving relatives have evidently suspected some “lip” in this film, which appears to erase them from the story in the service of exaggerating his redemptive friendship with Tony.Well, it’s a handsomely made and watchable picture and there is a real warmth in Ali and Mortensen’s performances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94ac92e1c2a0050d455c2176a49fbe827c45935f/0_4068_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53bfac983424c0cf3152cb1f35190f3b","title":"20 best egg recipes part 3 giorgio locatelli souffle custard tart carbonara","story":"A classic cheese souffle, an indulgent custard tart and Giorgio Locatelli’s perfect spaghetti carbonara – great recipes for an every day ingredientYou don’t need to use fancy bread for this recipe – a basic white bloomer or a soft white bread works best because it can be squeezed to enclose the filling.

Cook this roux on a gentle heat for a couple of minutes until it acquires a sandy texture. Add a small ladleful of the cooled milk to the roux and work it together, on the heat, to form a stiff paste. Strain the remainder of the milk into the paste and bring to the boil, whisking constantly. Simmer this white sauce on a very low heat, whisking occasionally, for 10 minutes. Pour in the cream and egg yolk mixture, simmer for a minute before adding all the gruyere and half the parmesan and then removing from the heat. Whisk the sauce to ensure the cheese melts before pouring into a large bowl and laying clingfilm across the surface.Melt the remaining butter and brush the interiors of the souffle moulds very thoroughly with the butter. Sprinkle the remaining parmesan in the moulds and rotate them in order to ensure an even coating. Place the moulds in the fridge.Preheat the oven to 190Cgas mark 5.Add a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt to the egg whites. Whisk the egg whites – preferably with an electric mixer – until they form stiff shiny peaks. Remove the film from the cheese mixture and whisk in a small amount of egg white, whisking vigorously to make a smooth mixture. Now add the remaining white and very gently cut and fold the mixtures together, making the mixture as homogenous as possible without losing volume. Spoon the mixture into the chilled souffle moulds. Smooth the surface with a palette knife before running a little knife around the top of the inside perimeter of the moulds to prevent the mixture sticking to the sides as it rises. The souffles can be chilled for up to an hour in the fridge at this juncture.Pour some boiling water into an oven tray. Place the souffles, spaced apart, in the tray and then bake the souffles for 11-13 minutes, by which time they should be well risen and firm to the touch.

In a sauté pan, heat the butter, then put in the guanciale or pancetta and fry until golden and crispy. Take off the heat, and lift out the guanciale or pancetta to a warm plate, so that it stays crunchy.Put the peppercorns into the pan and crush with a meat hammer or the end of a rolling pin, then add a couple of spoonfuls of the cooking water from the pasta and stir it around to take up all the bits of guanciale or pancetta which may have stuck to the bottom of the pan.Beat the egg yolks and a whole egg in a warm bowl with the grated pecorino romano.One minute before the spaghetti is ready, start to mix in a ladleful of the cooking water at a time until the eggs and cheese become creamy.Drain the pasta (but reserve the cooking water) and toss it in the pan of pepper, together with the reserved guanciale or pancetta.Add a little more cooking water if the pasta seems too dry, then transfer it to the bowl of eggs and cheese and toss well, until coated in the silky mixture.

Add the leek and sauté to soften – it will take 3-4 minutes – then start adding the spinach, a large handful at a time. Stir between each addition to wilt it. It may seem as if it will never fit in the pan, but as it wilts there will be hardly any volume left. Finally add the chopped herbs and mix them in to wilt, too. The whole process will take about 6-8 minutes, depending on the leaves you are using just make sure they are soft by the end of it.Remove the frying pan from the stove and season with the garlic and some salt and pepper. You can set this aside until you are ready to eat and the table is set it will also keep in the fridge until later.You only want to cook the eggs once everyone is at the table, as it is best to eat this while the yolks are still runny.Heat the spinach mixture again and use a spoon to create 4 little wells in the cooked leaves, one in each quarter. Crack an egg into each well, season the eggs with a touch of salt and pepper and cover the pan. Cook on a low heat until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny – about 3-4 minutes. Serve straight away. You can drizzle with some yogurt and sumac or serve it as is. It’s delicious either way.From Honey \u0026amp Co At Home by Sarit Packer \u0026amp Itamar Srulovich (Pavilion Books, £26)A custard tart is one of the finest puddings – crisp pastry filled with a rich, wobbly custard and topped with grated nutmeg. I usually like it best in its simplest form, but when raspberries, rhubarb or sweet, juicy cherries are in season, they make an excellent addition, creating little pockets of fruitiness and an even prettier pudding just leave out the nutmeg.Makes 1 tart, serving 6-8For the sweet pastryunsalted butter 80gcaster sugar 50gfine sea salt a pinchegg yolk 1plain flour 160g, plus extra for dustingFor the custardegg yolks 7 caster sugar 50g double cream 450ml vanilla pod 1 nutmeg for gratingTo make the pastry, mix the butter and sugar with a pinch of salt in an electric mixer or in a large bowl with a hand-held blender, until smooth and creamy.Add the egg yolk and continue to mix so it is well combined.Add the flour and mix briefly, then scoop the mixture into a clean bowl, add a tablespoon of cold water and, using your hands, bring the pastry together. Add another tablespoon of water if necessary to form a cohesive but firm dough. Wrap in clingfilm and allow to rest for at least an hour or overnight in the fridge.On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry until it is large enough to fit a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. When ready to make your tart, line your tin with the pastry, keeping any offcuts in case you need to plug any holes after blind baking.Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes while you preheat the oven to 150Cgas mark 2.Line the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake blind for 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and return to the oven for a further 15 minutes, until golden and sandy textured. Leave to cool while you prepare the custard.In a large bowl, whisk the yolks and sugar until the sugar has dissolved. Put the cream into a pan, slit the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape the seeds into the cream. (Place the empty pod in a jar of caster sugar to make vanilla sugar.)Heat the cream until it just starts to come to the boil, then pour it in a thin stream into the yolks, whisking as you do. Return the whole mixture to the pan and heat very gently, stirring continuously, until it thickens slightly.Strain the custard into a jug. If there are any lumps in the custard (caused by cooking it at too high a temperature), give it a whizz with a handheld blender until it is completely smooth.Pour the custard into the baked tart shell and return to the oven for 35-40 minutes or until the filling feels firm but still a little wobbly to the touch. Grate the nutmeg all over the surface and allow to cool completely. (The custard will set further.)

The days when Luiz Felipe Scolari was shown the door in February of his first season, André Villas-Boas was cut adrift in March or Roberto di Matteo, fresh from a European Cup triumph, dumped unceremoniously in late November are apparently long gone. Yet this is the kind of wretched occasion prone to leave a livid hierarchy flicking through a list of potential interims as they contemplate a return to chopping and changing. Head coaches, after all, have been condemned by defeats far less emphatic.Maurizio Sarri had spent most of the second half here scribbling frantically in a notepad while his team were shredded, brutally and brilliantly, out on the pitch by Bournemouth. The hosts had only recently emerged from a run of 11 defeats in 14 games in all competitions but poured through Chelsea’s panicked and pathetic ranks, their counterattacks carrying all the bite and incision their opponents have lacked since the late autumn, sensing little to no resistance en route. The notes could express nothing else but horror.Not since 1996 have the London club endured a league thrashing of this magnitude. In other words, Roman Abramovich has never had to digest a loss so unpalatable. All of which makes this situation feel far more volatile than it might otherwise have been. This is actually uncharted territory, for all Sarri’s post-match insistence that he felt more “frustrated” than under pressure. The Italian had cast his coaching staff from the away dressing room and, while they shivered outside, spent an hour with his players attempting to piece together what had gone so hideously wrong.Only César Azpilicueta and David Luiz dared to approach a disgruntled away support to offer their apologies after the final whistle though, by then, plenty had ventured out into the night and away. Those who watch this team consistently are finding everything, from tactics to substitutions to meek and feeble displays, grimly predictable at present. They had whipped up a chorus of “You don’t know what you’re doing” to greet Gonzalo Higuaín’s withdrawal when their team’s deficit was two. Sarri needs Higuaín, a player he convinced the board to buy, to make an immediate impact. The Argentinian’s Premier League debut amounted to being flagged twice for offside, and not a single shot fired off or chance created.Not that this defeat was down to the 31-year-old loanee from Juventus. Higuaín was just the latest Chelsea forward struggling to provide some bite for a team who ping passes with little intent, whose movement off the ball can become aimless, before desperation sets in. They had needed to shift the ball far more quickly during a first half when they were actually on top, but they never went closer than Mateo Kovacic’s early header that was tipped on to the crossbar by Artur Boruc. Bournemouth’s threat, as sporadic as it was at first, always carried more menace, not least because this Chelsea team are only ever one concession from a collapse. Retreat almost exactly a year and the Cherries had won 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. This time, they would run riot on home territory.The home side’s ruthlessness was utterly admirable, the slick nature of their passing and movement putting the Carabao Cup finalists to shame. There was Ryan Fraser’s clever flick for David Brooks, and the Welshman’s precisely weighted pull-back into space for Josh King to dispatch and force Bournemouth ahead. Then the combination play between King and Brooks around the hour mark, with Brooks cutting inside a befuddled David Luiz to slide in a second beyond the exposed Kepa Arrizabalaga.King, with a splendid finish from Junior Stanislas’ pass, and the substitute Charlie Daniels would complete the rout. The home side did not even need their top scorer Callum Wilson, who has undergone a minor knee operation to flush out the joint, to run amok. They were as brilliant as Chelsea were dreadful. The visitors’ goal difference had taken such a pounding by the end that they had even slipped behind Arsenal in the table. The six-point advantage they held only a few weeks ago is a distant memory, and the scrutiny is all on a head coach struggling, still, to comprehend why."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d86802dbf92f93142c5057daf76496abfb2b235/301_132_3189_1914/master/3189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bc003f9eb7e71e9cfaaa2b2a8eddbb0","title":"liverpool leicester premier league match report","story":"When the story comes to be told of the complete 2018-19 season, how vital will this game turn out to be? Liverpool have moved five points clear of Manchester City and, for that reason alone, it has been a profitable 48 hours for Jürgen Klopp’s team. Yet there was no getting away from the fact this was a missed opportunity for the Premier League leaders, with the first tell-tale signs of nerves sweeping Anfield and, most alarmingly for Klopp, perhaps getting into the minds of one or two players.This is certainly no time to get stage fright, with 14 games still to go, and it was particularly surprising given Sadio Mané, Liverpool’s most dangerous player, had given them the lead after only three minutes. Leicester were tough, obdurate opponents who refused to be cowed and demonstrated a spirit of togetherness that made it perplexing Claude Puel finds his position questioned so frequently, with four defeats from their previous five games.Liverpool, in turn, seemed to be feeling the pressure in a way that could not be said of them at any other time this season. It was rare, for example, to see Mohamed Salah so ineffective. It was not that Salah played badly, just that he did not get close to his most exhilarating levels. The same applied to the team as a whole and the crowd could not rouse themselves in the way that might have been expected. Overall, it was a strangely subdued night and, though it is important to remember Liverpool extended their advantage at the top, they did not look like a team who want to be regarded as champions-in-waiting. Nor did Manchester City at Newcastle the previous night, which makes it even more intriguing.Liverpool certainly set off as though they had been given a lift by the result at St James’ Park and there were people still taking their seats when Mané exchanged passes with Andy Robertson to conjure up the opening goal with a clever first touch and precise right-footed finish. Not one player in blue had managed a clean touch of the ball before it ended up in Kasper Schmeichel’s net and, in those early exchanges, Liverpool looked like a team in a hurry, keen to get the job done quickly.Instead, Leicester began to grow in confidence – encouraged, perhaps, by the clear suspicion Alisson might be in an unexpectedly obliging mood. The Liverpool goalkeeper’s casualness on the ball endangered his team on two occasions when the score was 1-0 and Klopp, never a manager to hide his emotions, was clearly startled by the manner in which his players were making life unnecessarily hard for themselves.The equaliser was the case in point, with Robertson giving away a needless free-kick to leave his team vulnerable. Klopp’s displeasure was clear on the touchline and, though James Maddison’s delivery was turned away, Leicester had plenty of players forward. Virgil van Dijk, who was marking Harry Maguire, had switched off and lost his man. Ben Chilwell, one of Leicester’s outstanding performers, returned the ball into the area and Maguire had the space and time to stroke his shot beyond Alisson.Liverpool’s crowd had been calling for a red card earlier in the first half when Mané shaped to run behind the Leicester defence only to be brought down by Maguire. The centre-half escaped with a booking, presumably because Robertson’s through ball was at a slight angle away from goal.Liverpool also felt aggrieved in the second half after a penalty appeal for Ricardo Pereira’s challenge on Naby Keïta. Pereira had trodden on Keïta’s left boot, just as he was taking aim with his other foot, but it happened so quickly, with so many players in close proximity, the referee, Martin Atkinson, gave Leicester the benefit of the doubt.Overall, though, the away team fully merited the draw and might even have snatched a win with some of the chances involving Maddison, Demarai Gray and, again, Maguire. The emphasis in the second half was on Liverpool to soothe the crowd’s anxieties. They could not manage it and Puel’s team have already shown this season they can raise their performance against the top sides, beating Chelsea and Manchester City since late-December.At half-time a team of groundsmen were sent on to remove flecks of snow from the penalty area that Liverpool would be attacking. The other side was left as it was , which was a bit sneaky, but understandable, perhaps, when there was so much at stake.Not that it made too much difference and, if anything, it was Leicester with the best opportunity of the second half when they broke on the counterattack and Gray decided to shoot instead of rolling the ball into Maddison’s path to leave his teammate a relatively simple finish. Maddison could also reflect on a golden chance inside the first half when he got his header horribly wrong inside the six-yard area.Liverpool had plenty of the ball but maybe the importance of the occasion restricted their performance – 29 years since their last league title. It ended in frustration and, for Manchester City, a measure of relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/853054246e6f3262b2b91427a5727e4d462f7de8/25_129_3955_2374/master/3955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c0c56bd967323893415a2eaa570f5a1","title":"tottenham hotspur watford premier league match report","story":"For Tottenham this was a night of a returning hero and, potentially, a new one. Time was running out, and the home side appeared to be heading for another defeat on the backs of those which had seen them depart two cup competitions in quick succession, when the goals they required for a turnaround arrived. The first was scored by Son Heung-min on his first appearance for Spurs since arriving back from the Asian Cup and then came the winner from someone who has been at the club all the while and finally may feel he belongs.The mix of relief and joy on Fernando Llorente’s face as he celebrated his goal with three minutes of this contest remaining was as eye-catching as it was understandable. The Spaniard has found it hard going ever since he joined Tottenham from Swansea two summers ago and especially in recent weeks as he has been asked to fill in for the injured Harry Kane. Quite simply, he is not in the England captain’s class, and that has been noticeable, painfully so at times, as was the case here on 52 minutes when he missed an absolute sitter. Cue howls of fury from the majority of the 29,164 people in attendance – Tottenham’s lowest ever crowd for a Premier League fixture at Wembley – yet they were in raptures when the player finally came good.Danny Rose swung a cross from the left deep into Watford’s area and the ball hung in the air long enough for Llorente to rise above José Holebas and send a perfectly placed header into the far corner of the net for his first league goal in over 12 months. Perfect timing and, you could say in light of recent comments by Mauricio Pochettino, a perfect boost for Llorente’s ego.“Fernando works so hard for the team and today he helped the team win three points,” said the Tottenham manager. “It is a massive thing and will help build his confidence.”That will be the hope for all concerned at Spurs before Newcastle’s visit here on Saturday, when another victory for the Pochettino’s men would see them overtake Manchester City in second and find themselves just four points behind Liverpool. Not bad for a side whose sense of purpose had yet again come into question following Sunday’s FA Cup defeat at Crystal Palace.“There are still a lot of games to play,” said Pochettino when asked about the significance of this result. “But this is a fantastic way to finish a little bit of the negativity that has been around in the last few days.”The biggest encouragement Pochettino can take from this contest is the spirit his players showed. Tottenham were not at their best, during the first-half especially, when their forward play was stodgy and predictable. But the second period proved very different as they performed with greater purpose and aggression.Much of that came from Son, who put in a remarkable display given he only returned from the United Arab Emirates on Saturday. The South Korean performed with his usual energy and direct running and drove Spurs on as they searched for an equaliser following Craig Cathcart’s goal for Watford on 38 minutes, the defender sending a header into an empty net, via a deflection off Davinson Sánchez, after Hugo Lloris hesitated in his attempt to keep out Holebas’s corner.That was the case from others in white and blue, Llorente included, and, as such, it would have been a shame if his most memorable contribution of the game had been the moment he caught the rebound to his own shot with a knee and sent the ball over a practically open net.It was a howler yet it was Watford who were ultimately left feeling sick. As Javi Gracia said, his side “missed a very good chance to get points against a very good team” and while the visitors were second best in terms of possession and territory, they arguably deserved a draw given the togetherness they showed throughout. Instead they remain ninth having lost for the first time in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b34dc34165c231284abeacec142013efbc38b2c/0_3382_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9011cede453f0ce4b2605372740e63b4","title":"young or old tell us about the major life events that shaped you","story":"We would like to hear from you as part of a project introducing readers of different generations to one anotherAs part of a new project that aims to explore major life events from different perspectives and across generational ides, the ’s Weekend magazine is looking to hear from readers.If one of the following questions apply to you, we’d like to hear from you.

But what do you think? Send us your thoughts and responsesMy partner, Liz, will be 80 on 29 March 2019, the very day we expect Brexit to kick in. We are both passionate remainers. A party or a wake is essential for that day, but it  presents problems: should leaver friends be invited? Would it be PC to play Beethoven’s Ode to Joy before or after Happy Birthday to You? What type of event should it be? Should it be EU themed? Are speeches (both partisan and laudatory) acceptable? It is a huge quandary that requires speedy resolution. Help!This could potentially be great. It could also be awfully dramatic, so I spoke to someone who deals with the most dramatic of parties – Christine Gallagher, a orce party planner. A orce party is a nice gesture that represents accepting the reality of Brexit, even if you are unhappy about it: “Leaving the EU is like leaving a marriage. It is sad and you wish it wasn’t that way, but you have to move on,” says Gallagher.In which case, invite friends from both sides of the fence. You only have one 80th birthday and it would be sad for your partner not to have half of her friends there. Gallagher recommends making it a lighthearted event, giving guests two choices of food, with tables on opposite sides of the room. “The remainers can have some yummy continental food like French cheese, paella, Belgian beer and champagne, and an EU flag hanging over their table. Give the leavers a union jack and British staples like roast beef, Cornish pasties, and fish and chips.” Guests who want to stray over to the opposing camp’s table may realise they have more in common than they thought.Remember that ided parties might clash. Let people know what they are in for on the invitation, spelling out that it’s a Brexit-themed party. Make your expectations around bickering clear. You could, for example, set a time limit for arguments and fine guests for not following the rules. You will need a way to diffuse tension, too. Gallagher suggests giving people a silly time-out section: “Build an effigy – perhaps a wall with the prime minister’s face on it – that people can throw sausage rolls at to take out their anger when it gets heated.”Music can help move the night along, so set a playlist. Gallagher suggests songs that riff off the theme – think Should I Stay or Should I Go by the Clash, and Hit the Road Jack by Ray Charles.Also, please make sure you have asked Liz if she’s happy with the plan. It is her birthday, after all, and you don’t want to pull out a surprise that she doesn’t like on the big day. Gallagher once had a client who was oblivious to the fact that her friends were throwing her a orce party: “It went down so badly, I decided never to agree to a surprise party again,” she says.Gallagher’s golden rule is to never invite children to orce parties, but this time she makes an exception: “They are being positive, trying to let go of bitterness and bad feelings around Brexit. The better question is whether children will want to be at an 80th birthday party.”• What do you think? Or have you got a question for Poppy and readers to consider?

Many more people are thought to have taken part in the event without signing the official pledge.At the same time, Britain’s supermarkets are reporting a surge in sales of vegan food and drink, which they expect to continue throughout the year. They are tapping into not only the burgeoning vegan market but also the UK’s estimated 22 million “flexitarians”, who enjoy meat but want to reduce their meat consumption.The number of Veganuary pledges for 2019 exceeded those in the previous four years combined, suggesting that veganism is becoming a mainstream movement. The organisers of Veganuary say six in 10 who take the “Veganuary pledge” say they plan to stay vegan.Thirteen new overseas partnerships increased Veganuary’s presence elsewhere in the world – in India, Sweden, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, South Africa, Japan, Iceland and Russia.“With a quarter of a million participants this year, Veganuary is finishing on an all-time high,” said Rich Hardy, head of campaigns at Veganuary. “I think Veganuary has reached critical mass now – vegan living is growing it’s here to stay, it’s part of the national conversation and it has credibility. That’s great news for people, animals and the planet.”Support for the campaign has also led to a vegan boost among food producers, with supermarkets, manufacturers and high street restaurant and pub chains also bolstering their plant-based ranges to meet demand.The Papa John’s takeaway chain this week ran into trouble with vegans who claimed they were sent real cheese pizzas after dairy-free alternatives ran out.On supermarket wine aisles, sales of Co-op’s own-label vegan varieties have doubled since it rolled out front-of-pack labelling last year. A new organic and vegan white wine has also had a fivefold increase in sales.Sainsbury’s has recently started selling fake meat next to the real thing, after a successful trial last year when it launched a new range of plant-based burgers and mince.Rather than being displayed in a dedicated vegan section, meat and fish alternatives such as jackfruit burgers and mushroom “shroomdogs” are being stocked alongside their meat counterparts in 20 branches of Sainsbury’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4ca7223c683571f5a76daafc13a45f5e180015f/874_406_2614_1568/master/2614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9690da485ab2853927928aef69430863","title":"uk broadcasters face advertising tipping point new study finds","story":"Audience decline found among 16 to 34-year-olds is forecast to hit other key demographicsBroadcasters are facing a tipping point in the next five years where a faster decline in traditional viewing will make TV campaigns too expensive to be cost-effective for advertisers.A new report is forecasting an “inflection point” for UK TV where the decline in viewing already well-established among 16- to 34-year-olds will spread to other key demographics ultimately threatening TVs greatest selling point of mass-market reach for advertisers.“TV has been the go-to media channel for advertisers seeking mass-reach,” says Christian Polman, chief strategy officer at Ebiquity, the media audit firm behind the report. “We are saying that unless action is taken by advertisers and broadcasters that by 2022 TV will no longer hold the crown as having the highest return on investment on a media plan.

Time may be at a premium to find a Brexit deal but MPs from all sides needed a little “me time”. A safe space to chill out. After their exertions the previous day, they were all a little dazed. Shellshocked even. Surprised at their ability to have reached a decision. Albeit one that had largely involved not making a decision. The cameras, the lights, the action had been all too much. A lie down was called for.On days like this, politicians often default to greater self-regard than usual. Parliament has spoken, they say grandiosely. And they have listened. Only they have all invariably heard something different and come to radically different conclusions. Some could have sworn they had voted to declare war on Jerry again. A handful were under the impression they had said they didn’t want a no deal but not enough to do anything about it. Most were just stunned – STUNNED – to discover they did have principles after all. Though not necessarily the principles they’d had the day before. A day is a long time in politics.Even Theresa May appeared to have undergone her own learning journey. In the past few years she has tried a number of different roles. The badly programmed Maybot incapable of coherent thought. The hopeless, dim-witted fall guy in a Channel 5 sitcom. But for this prime minister’s questions she appeared to have stepped up a gear. It wasn’t enough that the UK had turned into an international laughing stock. She had to go out and really own the shitshow. Make it hers and hers alone by stamping her lack of authority all over it. Only she could reconfigure a heavy defeat for her own deal as a massive victory.Jeremy Corbyn appeared rather less comatose – there was at least a pulse now – than he had in Tuesday’s debate and immediately put May on the back foot by asking what alternative arrangements she had in mind to replace the Northern Ireland backstop. You’d have thought the prime minister might have expected this question – after all, it was one her own Brexit secretary had failed to answer five times on the radio that morning – but she appeared to be completely wrongfooted.“Um ... We are engaging positively in a lot of things,” she mumbled. Not that any immediately came to mind, other than a trusted trader scheme – an idea so brainless that even David Davis had given up on it – and there were some exciting technologies in development involving badgers and night-vision goggles. May paused. It wasn’t always easy knowing what it was you didn’t know.Sensing the exchanges weren’t landing quite as well as she had hoped, she started digging herself in deeper. Under stress, she can’t help herself. The reason the UK was in its current mess was because of the EU’s insistence on maintaining a withdrawal agreement that she had negotiated and signed up to and though parliament may not want a no deal she was quite relaxed about delivering one if the worst came to the worst. Taking back control meant ignoring the will of parliament. A few members of the European Research Group grunted appreciatively but for the most part she was heard in near silence.After winding to a close by saying she had no intention of listening to the Labour leader’s proposals to remain in a customs union, May signed off by saying how much she was looking forward to meeting Corbyn later in the afternoon. The contempt in her voice was unmistakeable. As was the hostility in Corbyn’s body language.It is a match made in therapy and there is a worrying possibility that the future of the country might just depend on the ability of the Four Pot Plants to act as mediators for two social and political inadequates. “Now start by saying hello, Theresa, and offering Jeremy a biscuit. And Jeremy, you say thank you. Well done. That’s very good. Now stop hunching your shoulders and try to maintain eye contact with one another while you’re pretending to talk about a customs union. We’re not here to apportion blame.“That’s excellent. You’ve both done very well. Even though neither of you can really articulate exactly what you want. Now why don’t you spend the rest of the hour watching Jean-Claude Juncker and Guy Verhofstadt on TV explaining to the European parliament why they aren’t going to reopen the withdrawal agreement.”It would have been no more unlikely than the rest of PMQs at which May first defended her record on racism by citing her hostile environment as home secretary and closed with Nigel Dodds insisting that the Democratic Unionist party was the moderate voice of Northern Ireland. This from a party that boasts of never blinking in negotiations as it has cut off its own eyelids. The few MPs who were still in the chamber took note. That was one way of making sure they stayed awake."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e741cb50e50e2a46f76e92fe384549376f5d2578/0_252_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bd9b055ed64c91886762a6a66d13631","title":"collective insanity readers on the brexit amendment vote","story":"You have been reacting to MPs passing an amendment to replace the Irish backstop and discussing what might be next for BrexitWell, thanks, politicians.

The PM flies to Brussels on a completely pointless trip, to speak to people who do not want to talk to her, because she has to be seen to be doing something. The government uses dubious tactics to fend off legitimate challenges, the Labour opposition proves once again just how impotent it is, and the Tory press tout it as a triumph for the government.

Terry PotterWatching this yesterday, it appears that, with a number of notable and honourable exceptions, our MPs have joined in a form of collective insanity, earnestly discussing the number, size and temperament of the unicorns Treeza must bring back from Brussels, all the while ignoring the detailed report that declares the whole of the European continent to be a unicorn-free zone. It must be clear to almost everybody that ‘alternative arrangements’ on the backstop roughly translates as ‘we’ll blag it and hope no-one notices’, which may be OK in Westminster but could lead to violence in NI and Ireland. MrCosmopoliteTo the extent that I’m British I can only feel ashamed at the arrogance and stupidity of this country.

LastNameOnTheShelfSo parla-la-la-iament has voted for the latest fantasy to avoid the Tory Party from splitting. May has another two weeks being PM. Jacob Rees Mogg is another two weeks nearer his dream of a no-deal Brexit so he and his other hedge fund friends can make themselves richer unfettered by any EU directives. And vote-leavers can live happily ever after, even if they are poorer. Us remainers have been ignored again and if, as expected, the EU refuse to reopen negotiations then the blue press will have the headline they always wanted - that it is all the EU’s fault. It looks like we will be forced to go it alone before we can see who is right or wrong. TheDudleyOmmerPlease - going back to Brussels is nonsense. Labour in opposition totally outmanoeuvred in the political playground by the current prime minister. Corbyn is dust, Labour finished. Theresa May won’t stand for re-election and so it will go on post no-deal Brexit. Spencer Leonard WainThe Tories only squeaked a very narrow majority for a switch to the right by imposing a three-line whip on the party, meaning that any minister or junior minister who voted for Cooper-Bowles or against Brady would lose their government job - and any backbench Tory MP who did so would leave themselves open to deselection by their constituency party, egged on by Tory Central Office. The real battle will be when May comes back to the House on 14 February with whatever limp ‘alternative arrangements’, if any, she has been able to cobble together. If the nutters in the European Research Group won’t buy it, the Tory Remainers may have one last chance to demonstrate that they do actually have a backbone - if indeed they do. cripes2How is it possible that Corbyn comes out the bigger loser from last night’s latest episode of the Brexit farce? It surely requires a leader of exceptional ineffectiveness to have presided over last night’s debacle. The Labour party’s role has been absolutely woeful throughout Brexit, right from its failure to campaign strongly for remain in 2016. NowThatYouAskThe serious miscalculation here is that Britain hasn’t recognised the cost to the EU of the single market losing its integrity. In the eyes of the EU, having a blurry border in Ireland sets a precedent that makes their other external borders impossible to defend. This poses a greater cost and a greater risk to the whole of the EU than does a no-deal Brexit and for this reason they will not move. London has miscalculated. stuart255The UK signed up to the Good Friday Agreement after years of hard work to bring about and sustain peace in Northern Ireland and Ireland. Yesterday we saw parliament vote to refuse to accept May’s deal with the EU if we don’t have the right to renege on the GFA, which apparently parliament wishes to do, otherwise why kick up such a monster fuss over something we don’t want to do.

A party spokesman said they would be “spoken to by the whips’ office in the next few days”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b90a80768a4bad4ea2756b13a6e61c59df4a8488/1280_660_770_462/master/770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3b972bd3e958f6d54fffbb4859bc3e8","title":"theresa may faces pressure to clarify backstop changes","story":"Tory unity already evaporating as Barnier reiterates Brexit deal cannot be reopenedTheresa May is under mounting pressure to spell out what changes to the Irish backstop she hopes to negotiate with Brussels, after the fragile Brexit truce in her own party appeared to fray on Wednesday.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, became the latest senior figure to reject the idea of revisiting the withdrawal agreement on Wednesday, insisting: “Calmly, I will say, right here and now, we need this backstop as it is.”Downing Street said ministers would hold a series of meetings with backbench Conservative MPs, including supporters of the so-called “Malthouse compromise”, in the coming days, to thrash out an agreed approach.May also met the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in her office in the House of Commons for face-to-face talks – though Downing Street subsequently denied that she had signalled a shift in position towards a customs union.The prime minister won the backing of parliament on Tuesday for an attempt to return to Brussels and unpick the backstop her own government negotiated, to replace it with unspecified “alternative arrangements”.When challenged by Corbyn at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday about what those might be, she mentioned “a unilateral exit mechanism or a time limit to the backstop” – and technological approaches such as a “trusted trader scheme”.She added that Tuesday’s vote showed there was a sustainable majority for a deal, if objections to the backstop were tackled.However, the EU seemed sceptical of her claims. Its most senior official told the prime minister on Wednesday evening it was her job to resolve the impasse. The European council president, Donald Tusk, warned May, in what sources described as an “open and frank” 45-minute phone call, that a precondition for any further talks was a concrete plan from Downing Street that could clearly command the support of parliament.She said that parliament had highlighted the issue that needed to be addressed in Tuesday’s vote. But the EU source said May had then failed to offer any proposals.Tusk is understood to have replied that May could not expect Brussels to come to her rescue with a solution. EU officials and leaders are increasingly concerned that Downing Street is seeking to blame Brussels for their failures.Before talks with the EU have even resumed, the prime minister is facing demands from Brexiters in her own party to overhaul her negotiating team.Some claim that they had received assurances from No 10 in the run-up to Tuesday’s crunch vote that May’s chief negotiator, Ollie Robbins – a bogeyman for many pro-Brexit MPs – would be joined on future missions to Brussels by Crawford Falconer, the UK’s top trade negotiator.May’s spokesman insisted on Wednesday that there had been no changes to the team, prompting the European Research Group’s Steve Baker to complain: “Excluding our chief trade negotiation adviser from our principal trade negotiation is a longstanding mistake which should be rectified now.”Falconer, who works in Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade, was previously New Zealand’s representative to the World Trade Organization. He worked with the pro-Brexit thinktank the Legatum Institute before being brought into government.The prime minister met Corbyn on Wednesday afternoon, after which the two sides disagreed about whether the prime minister was willing to soften her opposition to a customs union.A spokesman for the Labour leader said shortly after the meeting broke up that the prime minister had shown a “serious engagement in the detail” of Corbyn’s proposal for a customs union with the EU after Brexit.A few minutes later, Downing Street responded by saying that while May had asked Corbyn questions, her underlying position had not shifted.The party leaders held a 45-minute meeting that was described as “serious and engaged” by Labour. The Labour spokesman added that May was “interested in exploring the details of each element” of Labour’s Brexit proposals.The two party leaders will meet again soon, most likely within days. Corbyn made an offer to May at last year’s party conference that Labour could swing behind her deal if she backed a customs union, and offered fresh reassurances on workers’ rights and environmental standards.May has repeatedly insisted the UK must be able to strike its own trade deals, which would rule out joining a customs union – but many in Westminster still believe she could ultimately be pushed in that direction.Some Tory Brexiters have even hinted they might be willing to swallow the idea of a customs union if the backstop were struck out of the legally binding withdrawal agreement. “Can we get up and leave this thing one day, if we want to?” asked one senior leaver. “Is our destiny in our hands?”Other Brexiters are urging their restive colleagues to be patient and give May the space to negotiate. The former Brexit secretary David Davis said it was unlikely that May would make significant progress before 13 February, when she has promised to report back to parliament. “I would not expect the Europeans to start moving seriously until March – until the exit day is absolutely imminent. That’s just based on their past behaviour,” Davis said.Meanwhile, a leaked memo from the industry minister, Richard Harrington, obtained by Sky News, poured cold water on proposals drawn up by Nicky Morgan and Jacob Rees-Mogg, among others, to resolve the Brexit impasse.On the idea of technological solutions to avoid a hard border, his note said: “This idea was considered and rejected by both the UK and the EU in summer 2018, as both parties concluded that it would not maintain an open border. That is why we ended up with the current backstop. There is currently no border in the world, outside a customs union, that has eliminated border infrastructure.”Harrington has issued a series of increasingly dire public warnings about the risks of a no-deal Brexit in recent days, even going as far as to say that he was prepared to be sacked for doing so.The Brexit select committee chair, Hilary Benn, also questioned May’s plans on Wednesday, describing her remarks in the Commons as “a rerun of last summer, when the cabinet discussed technology, trusted traders and the maximum facilitation proposal as a way of solving the NI border problem” – all of which were then rejected by the EU. He warned that May appeared to have “decided to go through the same process all over again for reasons of party management rather than in the national interest”.Downing Street later dismissed remarks from the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, suggesting that Tuesday’s cross-cutting series of votes had made a “disorderly” Brexit more likely.“What the vote has done is set out what parliament requires in order to pass this deal, so we now have clarity. The EU has said that it was seeking clarity,” a spokesman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ea4ffd92f148416bb0fe29e151e2f962d13cd2f/121_82_5283_3170/master/5283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c11171f8e0c2248d0c88a340c553366","title":"ben youngs england ireland niggly stuff","story":"England’s players believe they have no option but to match Ireland’s “fighting” qualities if they want to make a fast start to the Six Nations. They have not beaten their hosts or even scored a try in their last three visits to Dublin and the scrum-half Ben Youngs has pinpointed the breakdown and aerial contest as crucial areas on Saturday.“With Irish teams you talk about the passion but really they just love the fight,” said Youngs, set to win his 81st cap. “When I say the fight I am talking about the breakdown, the aerial stuff, the bits of the game that are no talent required, niggly stuff. They are just mad for those little fights.“I am not talking physical fights. With club or country, when we’ve come unstuck, it’s been around the breakdown. They’ve just been able to deal with it better, make it slower and frustrate you.“They’ve got a huge number of guys who can jackal and get over the ball and they’ve got a defensive system that puts you under pressure. It’s a huge strength of theirs. It’s caused us problems and it’s no surprise we’ve spent a lot of time focusing on the breakdown.”Eddie Jones will announce his starting lineup on Thursday with Mike Brown hoping for a recall as England seek to defuse the threat of Johnny Sexton’s and Conor Murray’s tactical kicking. “Mike Brown’s ability to operate under the high ball is probably the best in the country,” Youngs said.“Dealing with the high ball is still a phenomenal strength of his game. You suspect Ireland will certainly test us with contestable kicks and use that as weapon as they have done in the past. Seeing someone like Mike back involved in the squad is terrific, because he adds a huge amount of experience in that area.”Youngs said it will not bother him unduly whether his Leicester teammate George Ford or Owen Farrell is standing at first receiver as England finalise their midfield in the absence of the injured Ben Te’o.“Losing someone of Benny’s qualities is never ideal this close to the game but what we do have are a lot of great players to cover centre,” Youngs said. “With Benny missing out it opens the door for others. We just have to adapt and we’ll be able to do that.“The expectation is that Ireland are the best team in the northern hemisphere but the Six Nations is such a competitive tournament. That’s why everyone gets so engrossed in it, because you never really know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/599b56d653792c8fbc510c88b502dfb0c9262b5e/0_479_2836_1701/master/2836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6c604a0a4ae73f35c157098393d19f9","title":"grand national horse racing ireland entries no deal brexit","story":"The looming possibility of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March has not deterred Ireland’s trainers from making a record entry of 47 horses for the Grand National at Aintree in April, which is due to be run just eight days after the UK is due to leave the European Union. The entry from Ireland is up from 40 last year, when 16 of the eventual 38 runners were Irish-trained, including the first four home.A no-deal Brexit could pose significant logistical problems for horses travelling from Ireland, however, as it would remove the current certainty of frictionless travel across borders. Predictions of tailbacks at ferry ports would inevitably prompt fears of welfare issues for thoroughbreds moving to and from Britain for racing, breeding or the sales, not least as the majority of horses moving from Ireland to the UK do so by ferry.The number of Irish-trained runners in Great Britain has risen steadily in recent years, from just over 1,100 in 2014 to 1,504 in 2018. Ireland sent 50 runners to last season’s three-day Aintree Festival meeting, up from 40 in 2017, and 150 to the Cheltenham Festival in March, from where 17 returned home as winners.The rise in the number of Irish-trained runners in the UK reflects racing’s enduring popularity in a country where the number of inidual owners and horses in training continued to rise in 2018. The ease of movement between the two countries has also helped to facilitate the Irish challenge at all levels in Britain, however, and any threat to the status quo is a major concern for racing executives on both sides of the Irish Sea.“Whether that’s a horse travelling to and from Britain for a race or a sale, it will cause disruption and delay.”Aintree itself, however, remains optimistic that its showpiece event will not suffer in the fallout from even a no-deal Brexit.“We recognise the huge amount of uncertainty surrounding Brexit right now,” a spokesperson for the track said, “but the government has issued clear guidance that the import of thoroughbreds from the EU into the UK will not be impacted even in a no-deal Brexit scenario as the UK will replicate current systems."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/026b79fcead0854214df610198892770613225fb/0_189_5561_3336/master/5561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdccb295268b386f9b9eb17436632e34","title":"facebook fourth quarter profits revenues earnings","story":"Fourth-quarter results beat expectations for earnings and revenue as profit hits $6.88bn, up from $4.27bn a year beforeFacebook closed the book on its scandal-plagued year Wednesday, with strong fourth quarter financial results that beat analyst expectations for earnings and revenue.The results highlighted how orced Facebook’s business success is from its public reputation, which suffered another blow Wednesday when Apple punished the app maker for violating its rules with a program that paid users as young as 13 to install an app that surveilled them.Crucially, usage metrics grew across all geographic regions, including slight growth in Europe and North America. In July, Facebook’s stock price plummeted after the second-quarter earnings showed stagnating user growth in North America and a slight decline in Europe.On a conference call with investors, executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg sketched a path for the company to move forward from the constant damage control mode of 2018. Both executives attempted to frame the company’s extensive problems – such as the misuse of private data, rampant misinformation, and foreign influence operations – as “social issues” endemic to the internet as a whole, and not particular to Facebook.Zuckerberg asserted that Facebook had “fundamentally changed how we run this company” and greatly improved its systems to reduce future problems. As such, he suggested that in 2019, the company would be able to refocus on product development to “deliver more experiences that meaningfully improve people’s lives” with new innovations in messaging, payments, groups, video and hardware.Among the product changes is a planned integration of messaging platforms for WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, which was first reported by the New York Times last week. Zuckerberg confirmed that the company was considering this change, which he said was still a “long term project” and would see more of Facebook’s products using end-to-end encryption.“Facebook might have delivered its weakest quarterly revenue growth since listing in 2012, but these numbers are actually some of the most reassuring in its short history,” said George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.“The way that I feel starting 2019 is that we have clear roadmaps looking at what we need to do,” Zuckerberg said. “I do feel like we’ve started to turn a corner and have a clear plan for what we need to do now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f60bed32e542702e53173f5efae55a7f37992a8/0_178_5480_3289/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f9abe8eed96d077ed6ab26515b3b4a9","title":"tesla factory elon musk layoffs company","story":"Alan Ochoa worked at Tesla’s Fremont plant in California for four years. He was laid off recently along with his entire department in quality control, many of whom were also long-time employees. “I have no idea how they expect to run without us,” said Ochoa.Ochoa predicts Tesla’s “difficult road” will not be helped by laying off experienced staff.He said: “My last repair on Friday was finding a rear fascia was missing a screw so if you pulled on it, it would pop out. I grabbed a drill, the screw, got down on my knees and made the repair myself. No one would have known about it unless they tugged on the edges of the rear fascia like I had made it a habit to do.“But I know once the car starts driving it would become unseated due to the wind pulling it out.”An internal document provided to laid-off employees explained those who were dismissed were selected “by evaluating the criticality of each position, identifying duplicate roles, and by assessing the specific skills and abilities of each inidual in the company”.Workers past and present believe Tesla is trying to cut costs by getting rid of more expensive, and experienced, staff. The company disputes this.Tesla has a one through five pay ranking system for employees. Five represents the most senior.Anthony Lamendola worked at the Lathrop facility, also in California, for nearly seven years before being laid off.Lamendola, who was also level five, said: “They let all the people go who have been there level rive or more, all level fours and threes, only kept one, two, some threes. I’ve never been late, never called in, never been wrote up in over six years. I’m just am in shock for them to do this and keep temps and new hires.”A current Tesla employee at Lathrop who requested anonymity for fear of losing their job, noted temporary employees and recent hires were kept on, while many long-time employees were laid off as part of the cuts. “This was a move I was expecting due to the high price of raw metal from our president’s tariff war with China,” the worker said. “Tesla Lathrop has a large amount of people that wanted to go union.”Back at the Fremont plant, a current employee who has worked for over four years at the plant was transferred to work on car seats as part of restructuring. He noted many transferred employees took hourly pay cuts, and a few walked off the job as a result.“It seems like they tried to get rid of the older, more experienced guys making more money than the entry level. I personally see and feel this is aimed at the higher-waged employees,” the employee said. “They replaced me with a $19 an hour worker. I make $26 an hour.” He was told his transfer would be a lateral move and wouldn’t include a pay cut, but he’s still wary that his pay will be reduced from changing departments.“I loved Tesla at one point. But four and a half years of living what I lived through, I don’t feel the love, what a good, dedicated employee should feel from a company.”Another employee at the Fremont plant noted that dozens of newly hired workers started training the week after the mass layoff, and that there was also an elimination of overtime. “You get in trouble with one minute of overtime, which is counter-productive because you have people wrapping up earlier than they normally would so they don’t risk going over,’ the worker said.A Tesla spokesperson said: “We are continuing to hire for essential positions.” The company denied senior and high-waged employees were targeted in the layoff.The cuts have been severe. A third employee at the Fremont plant explained his department was cut in half, with the employees who survived this round of layoffs forced to do even more work.“We’re going to have to take over their positions,” the employee said. “We have to do our job, plus the contractor job. Usually we have to work for two people, now, we’re going to have to work for three people.”Tesla has suffered quality control setbacks in the past and workers fear those issues may be worsened by the cuts. Ochoa explained he was making several dozen repairs a day on quality control, depending on what line he was on.He said: “I fear the quality will be greatly diminished. Not all of my repairs were easy to see but would have a lasting effect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/835c3800cf2e75604ffc5bc284a8eaa9d7976714/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10948cdc97342cb1ae66b05e2fb4c782","title":"from buffy to boardwalk empire your favourite boxsets ever","story":"Vampire slayers, bootleggers, polygamists and the most evil villain since Satan ... readers respond to our critics’ list with more brilliant binge-worthy TV we missedI’m surprised by the omission of this.

Brilliant. scausmausFor science fiction fans, add the reboot of Battlestar Galactica. It holds up pretty well on rewatching, although you can see the strain between Ron Moore and Sci-Fi Channel, as it was then, all the more with the passage of time, from the weak “standalone” episodes in season three (Sci-Fi wanted more of those) to the rushed last season (it was supposed to run five seasons, but Sci-Fi would only commit to one more after series three, so Moore cut parts out.) Craig DeBlockMy absolute favourite. Yes, a few poor episodes and sub-plots, but all in all it was brilliant. Coming from a North American evangelical childhood (I’m now humanist) made it all the more enthralling. Bill Paxton, Chloë Sevigny, Jeanne Tripplehorn and so many more great performances.

He has even played super-villain Charles Augustus Magnussen in Sherlock. But on a stopover in London between shoots, the laidback 54-year-old startlingly reveals that his latest TV role has truly transformed him, prompting a major life-change that still bemuses many around him.The decision that rocked the Mikkelsen clan occurred while he was shooting the show for which he recently won best actor at the International Emmys. He plays Johannes Krogh, a pastor who feels an intense personal connection with God, in Ride Upon the Storm. The ecclesiastical TV drama – written by Adam Price, creator of the Danish political epic Borgen – started in the UK this week after acclaim in Denmark, France and the US.Mikkelsen was raised by communist atheist parents, but says that at first he felt no obstacle to playing a man of God. You don’t have to be a Scottish murderer to act Macbeth, as Mikkelsen has done on the Copenhagen stage. “At the start,” he says, “my own background didn’t matter in terms of making a priest seem real.” But the longer he inhabited the part, the more impact it had. “Acting is a messy thing: it’s partly you, partly what’s in the script, and partly what you can pick up from your research. You’re left with a bloody mess in the end. You tend to want to make sense of it after.”But how could he make sense of playing a priest whose faith is so fervent that at one point, like a desperate lover, he climbs a ladder to kiss a statue of crucified Christ? Late in the filming of the second season, Mikkelsen went to see a pastor himself, and asked to be baptised into the National Church of Denmark. It was rather as if, while paying Petrov in House of Cards, he had gone to the Kremlin and started running Russia.The ceremony was low-key – head splashed three times with holy water, rather than total immersion – but it was such a change that it unnerved his family and friends. “I don’t know if they’ve accepted it yet,” he says. “Actually, I’m not sure I have. I can’t explain it. I think I’d been fighting it for a while. As I get older, I feel it’s important to be true to myself. And this felt true to myself.”His character has a line about churches being “built for the big moments in life”, and he came to the same conclusion. “I’m getting older, experiencing people dying, and to give that meaning, I found churches and ministers to be the right place.” He also wanted to feel part of a community: “For me it was the church. But if you don’t like that, join a fucking political party, join a trade union. It’s important to me that we join rather than disconnect.”For those viewers who may be resistant to religion, Johannes is a very human type of priest, prone to heavy drinking and adultery. Conflict with his sons – one also a priest, the other a troubled drifter – make Ride Upon the Storm a pacy, racy family drama as well as an exploration of faith.“Johannes is a real piece of work,” says Mikkelsen. “One of the concerns that often comes up in drama is how to make the character more likable, so we can relate to them. Actually, why can’t we sometimes just let the characters fucking cross a line, so the audience dislikes the guy and he has to retain our trust? Shakespeare does it all the time, but we’re now so afraid of losing the audience. Real people can be horrible. My family is not sympathetic to me the whole time.” He has two children with the Danish actress Anette Støvelbæk. “Sometimes I need to gain their trust again.”The pressure to follow parental example is another key theme of Ride Upon the Storm, though such an idea never seems to have occurred to Mikkelsen, whose parents were a nurse and bank worker. His younger brother, Mads, is also an internationally successful actor, having starred in movies including Pusher, Casino Royale and King Arthur. Was there some greasepaint DNA further back? “Nothing! It’s crazy, I know. We tend to attribute it to a rebellion. Mads was a street-dancer and I was a juggler originally. The 80s was a good time to try whatever appealed to you. The young generation now are pushed into further education, which I think is a bad thing. We were freer.”Lars says he and his brother are not competitive, and have only been up for the same role once. “It’s not been common, because we are very different-looking. But we were once up for a part Mads got but then couldn’t do, so I did it. It was called The Spider, and turned out to be my breakthrough role.” He soon attracted the attention of UK and US casting directors, leading to Sherlock and House of Cards, after the 2008 crime drama Forbrydelsen – AKA The Killing – led the surprise Scandinavian invasion of worldwide television.Lars had a small role in Borgen, which prompted Price to give him the lead in Ride Upon the Storm. “Adam wanted to do something more political than Borgen, and found that in religion. Nowadays, Norwegian church elections get nasty. By telling the truth about what the church is supposed to believe in, my character gets into trouble. Is that the democracy we want?”In House of Cards, Lars’s character, Viktor Petrov, president of the Russian Federation, has the same initials and KGB background as the real deal. Was Mikkelsen really just playing Putin? “Oh yeah, it was some version of him. But the work I did was how to elaborate on that and not just make it a parody.” Mikkelsen watched films of Putin’s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, and foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and was struck by their being soft cops to his hard cop. “Lavrov is much more suave than Putin, who comes across as very callous and harsh. And Petrov, to me, was a suave character.”The final run of House of Cards was unusual because the show had lost the lead, after Netflix’s removal of Kevin Spacey, who played President Frank Underwood. This followed multiple allegations of past sexual misbehaviour on movie sets and elsewhere, some of which he has denied, but which remain in various stages of investigation.Was there a strained atmosphere on the Spacey-less set? “I got in so late in the last season – there were doubts about whether it was going to happen at all – that everyone had settled by then. People just wanted to finish it off as well as possible. So I didn’t really feel any tension. But of course, it was strange that he wasn’t there. That was weird.”Turning suddenly solemn, Mikkelsen says: “All I can say is that he was nice to me, man. And a phenomenal actor. It’s sad, really sad.” Has he had any contact with Spacey subsequently? “No! I don’t know the man. That’s the difference between working in Denmark and outside. I didn’t really know any of the people on House of Cards. In Denmark, we go out and have beers.” Had there ever been any gossip or unease about Spacey on set? “I never heard anything really. But for that final season, I was maybe there four days.”The #MeToo movement has hit Scandinavian showbusiness also, he says: “It’s a necessary movement. Predators have no place in the business.” Scandinavia has always been seen as a very sexually free place. Was that a complication? “Yes, that was an issue. But it has to be freedom with consent. You can always discuss how serious an offence was and whether there can be assumption of guilt without trial and so on. But that’s all secondary to the need to do something – and this movement did something.”Mikkelsen now acts regularly in both Danish and English. Does he think of them as “home” and “away” tongues, or is he comfortable in both? “I’m getting more and more at home in English, but it’s still quite an effort. With House of Cards, I had a Russian accent, which really helps to go somewhere that isn’t English English. For Sherlock, I had a Scandi accent. I’d like to be able to speak English without an accent, but it will take years yet.”He’s currently filming The Witcher, a fantasy series for Netflix based on a video game, and will host more episodes of the factual series Historien om Danmark, a huge hit at home, which tells the story of the people, landscape and wildlife of his nation. It has given him the second surprise conversion of his career. He laughs loudly. “Now I’m the David Attenborough of Denmark!”• Ride Upon the Storm is on Channel 4 on Sunday nights at 11pm, and is available on All 4 now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6db221f1f962675a4efa058612627d4cb2120e5/0_46_3291_1975/master/3291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4420a1081848160d51917e6af531258","title":"mueller evidence leaked online russians","story":"More than 1,000 files shared confidentially appeared to have been uploaded to a filesharing site, according to court documentsEvidence gathered by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, was obtained by Russians and leaked online in an attempt to discredit his inquiry into Moscow’s interference in US politics, prosecutors said on Wednesday.A court filing by Mueller’s office said more than 1,000 files that it shared confidentially with attorneys for indicted Russian hackers later appeared to have been uploaded to a filesharing site and promoted by a Twitter account.“We’ve got access to the Special Counsel Mueller’s probe database as we hacked Russian server with info from the Russian troll case,” a tweet from the account said. “You can view all the files Mueller had about the IRA and Russian collusion. Enjoy the reading!”The tweet was posted in October last year by the account @HackingRedstone, according to the filing. A reporter was also offered leaked material via a direct message the same day. The account has since been removed from Twitter.Mueller’s court filing on Wednesday said the names and structure of folders containing the leaked files matched those used by Mueller’s office when it shared the data, and that these had not been made public.The prosecutors said the filesharing site had confirmed to the FBI that the account which posted the material was registered from an IP address – an identifier for devices connected to the internet – in Russia.FBI investigators had found no evidence that government servers holding the data had been hacked, according to Mueller’s team, pointing instead to a leak on the Russian side. Mueller disclosed the leak in a filing as part of his prosecution of Concord Management and Consulting, a Russian company that allegedly funded hacking operations by Russia’s notorious Internet Research Agency (IRA).The filing argued that attorneys for Concord should not be given access to “sensitive” evidence gathered by Mueller’s team for the case.It said: “The person who created the webpage used their knowledge of the non-sensitive discovery to make it appear as though the irrelevant files contained on the webpage were the sum total evidence of ‘IRA and Russian collusion’ gathered by law enforcement in this matter in an apparent effort to discredit the investigation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e63a76b71b2990f49f6856b0032a4b1f595bfac/0_230_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6100526b154d3e4a05fe20566fa23788","title":"polar vortex 2019 usa what is it temperatures cold weather climate change explained","story":"The polar vortex has broken into ‘two swirling blobs of cold air’, bringing the most frigid conditions in decades to the midwestAs its name suggests, the polar vortex is found around the north pole. It’s a band of strong winds, high up in the atmosphere that keeps bitterly cold air locked around the Arctic region. This circulation isn’t considered a single storm, or even a weather pattern as such.Occasionally, the vortex can become distorted and meander far further south than normal. The phenomenon became widely known to Americans during a particularly frigid spell in 2014, when the media first started using the term “polar vortex”. It was also a factor in the “bomb cyclone” that battered the US east coast last year.This time, the polar vortex has broken in two, bringing the coldest conditions in decades to the midwest US. On Wednesday, Chicago was 10 degrees F colder than Antarctica.“At the moment the vortex looks like two swirling blobs of cold air, one settled over North America, the other over Eurasia,” said Jennifer Francis, the senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center. “It splits up when there is sudden stratospheric warming.”Studies have pointed to a recent increase in instances where the polar vortex has bulged down into heavily populated areas. Scientists are gaining a better understanding of why this is happening, with many identifying climate change as an influence.There’s some evidence that the jet stream, a meandering air current that flows over North America and Europe, is slowing and becoming wavier as the planet warms. The jet stream interacts with the polar vortex, helping bring numbing temperatures further south.Scientists also point to a complex sequence of events involving sea ice, which is rapidly diminishing in the Arctic. As the ice retreats, summertime heat is absorbed by the dark ocean that lies underneath. This heat is released into the atmosphere during winter, spurring winds that can disrupt the polar vortex.“We aren’t entirely there yet but there’s more and more support for this concept,” said Francis. “It’s a new and developing hot research topic.”Well, Donald Trump certainly thinks so. “In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can’t last outside even for minutes,” the US president tweeted on Monday. “What the hell is going on with Global Waming (sic)? Please come back fast, we need you!”Scientists were quick to point out climate change’s role in allowing Arctic air to flow south, as well as to remind the president that winters still exist.A localized, albeit large, cold snap isn’t representative of the rest of the planet, as Australians currently sweltering in searing record heat of more than 46C (114F) will be well aware of. The past four years have been the hottest on record for the globe.In the US, record-breaking high temperatures are outnumbering record lows by a ratio of two to one. Research suggests this ratio will expand to 16 heat records for every cold record set if the US warms by 3C (5.4F) this century, which is likely unless greenhouse gases are severely curtailed.Trump’s repeated tweets mocking climate science when the temperature drops are “ridiculous, in a word”, said Francis. “He cares not to understand. It’s the only explanation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/becf5049382ea31977dcd7a3d1f3737bf42cc466/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b234f8239702460d40953e4fdc00471","title":"cold as of chicago residents make best of life in chiberia during polar vortex","story":"Residents brave the weather to post photographs on social media showing just how cold things have gotIn “Chiberia” – as locals have dubbed Chicago as temperatures have plummeted to -23F (-30C) – it is cold enough to freeze an egg on the sidewalk. Or to turn a bubble blown outside into a beautiful frosty snow globe before it splinters with the cold.A blast of polar air has swept across many cities in the US leading to the lowest temperatures in a generation. Schools and businesses have closed, flights have been cancelled and as of Wednesday evening, at least eight deaths had been linked to the system.Chicago isn’t the only city hit by the low temperatures, or the coldest, with the temperature dropping to -42F (-41C) in Park Rapids, Minnesota.While the extreme cold is miserable for many, some have been trying to find a bright side. In Chicago, residents have posted photographs on social media showing just how freezing life has become.Local news outlets have made their reporters brave the elements to test whether an egg placed in a frying pan at these temperatures would freeze – the opposite of frying an egg on the sidewalk in extreme heat, which the  Australia team found required hotter temperatures than you might expect.“Cold as ºF,” was the headline on the Loyola Phoenix, the official student newspaper of Loyola University in Chicago and on Tuesday, the Chicago Tribune ran sage weather-related advice on its front page: “Expert: avoid being outside”.But many ignored the expert warnings and ventured into the cold to attempt the “boiling water challenge”, which saw people throw pots of boiling water into the air, which froze before hitting the ground.Others posted videos of bubbles blown outside, which freeze into gorgeous baubles before cracking, or of their fork suspended in mid-air by a waterfall of frozen noodles. The hashtag #DogsofChiberia was created, showing pets rugged up in custom puffer jackets, hats and booties so they could survive a trip outside.Videos also circulated that appeared to show train tracks across Chicago on fire. The fires, which actually run next to the rails, are used by Metra, the Chicago-area commuter rail, to make the rails expand in an attempt to avoid cracks forming and switches clogging.Temperatures in Chicago were expected to fall into the -20s F (-30s C) again on early Thursday, but should warm up to the comparatively balmy 20Fs (-7 to -2C) by Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0c36fcd8c0e2a97a7a54eace8f2a81f2e3d9ddc/0_37_5299_3179/master/5299.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e0e7412f13134c3f2f01a2f801944fcf","title":"911 judge rushed from guantanamo in medical emergency","story":"Judge Keith Parrella flown out of Cuban military base for surgery after initial delay that wife blamed on insurance disputeThe military tribunal hearings against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other alleged 911 conspirators have been stalled after the judge was flown out for emergency eye surgery.At 7pm on Tuesday evening Parrella summoned defence and prosecution lawyers and informed them he was being flown out of the US military base in south-east Cuba back to the mainland for urgent medical treatment.The judge was flown out on Wednesday, after his wife, Jennifer Parrella, tweeted overnight to accuse the military’s medical insurance provider, for a delay which she said threatened her husband’s sight in one eye.Kevin Dwyer, a spokesman for the Defence Health Agency, said on Wednesday that “at no time” did the insurance company refuse to evacuate the patient.“A lack of available aircraft briefly delayed the medical evacuation, but this situation has been rectified,” Dwyer said. “The Department will work to ensure future extraction delays are avoided.”The Office of Military Commissions issued a brief statement that read: “Due to a medical issue impacting the military judge’s ability to work, the rest of the session is cancelled.”Parrella was made judge in the 911 case last August, taking control of a case that has been dogged by false starts, procedural delays and controversy over the military commissions themselves. The defendants, accused of having orchestrated the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon killing nearly 3,000 people, were first charged in 2008. But the case is still in its preliminary phase, with a trial not expected to begin before 2020 at the earliest.Much of the contention is testimony from the defendants obtained after long periods of torture in CIA “black sites” before they were flown to Guantánamo.Parrella’s fitness to try the case is being challenged in federal court by defence lawyers for failing to disclose the extent of prior relationships with members of the prosecution team.On Monday one of the defendants, Ramzi bin al-Shibh – a Yemeni accused of arranging for some of the hijackers to go to flight school in the US and helping finance the operation – challenged Parrella’s authority to preside over the court.The defendant had raised a similar objection before, but on this occasion Parrella appeared rattled by the challenge and said his attitude “could potentially put everyone in this room’s safety in jeopardy” – a claim that surprised defence lawyers, who interpreted it as a threat to shackle the prisoner.On the same day, defence lawyers threatened to boycott proceedings over what they said was aggressive FBI questioning of a legal assistant who had left Guantánamo in December.On Tuesday, Parrella heard opposing arguments over whether the testimony of a former defence interpreter could be heard in open court. Defendants had claimed they had seen the interpreter at a “black site” and it was confirmed he had worked for the CIA. Defence lawyers have been seeking to question him on whether he had been CIA infiltrator. Parrella ruled that the hearing would have to be held behind closed doors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ffed2c05b41f74d2e5d4576ea2192eb309acddc/0_229_2968_1782/master/2968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07c3e02cb6d5e8cb9eb8dc646cd1e189","title":"eu leaders must do more to save rule of law in hungary says mep","story":"Judith Sargentini of Dutch Greens says situation has got worse since her report last yearEuropean Union leaders are failing to act despite the “worsening” outlook for the rule of law in Hungary, according to a leading MEP.Judith Sargentini, a Dutch MEP whose report triggered the EU’s most serious disciplinary procedure against Hungary last September, called on the Council of EU member states to start “a real process” that would examine the rule of law in that country.“Since the vote on my report in September things in Hungary actually only got worse,” said the Green MEP.Since MEPs voted to trigger action from EU member states, she said the Central European University had moved to Vienna and the government had created a new court that will be subject to ministerial control.She also listed the decision to award refugee status to a former Macedonian prime minister convicted of corruption, the “slave law” on overtime, which has brought Hungarians on to the streets, as well as the merger of 450 media outlets without authorities being able to make usual checks.The MEP called on Romania, which is chairing the EU rotating presidency, to produce a timetable for examining the rule of law in Hungary, as she accused Budapest of stalling the process. “Hungarian citizens have the right for protection and have the right to know what you are planning to do.”Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, said he regretted that Sargentini had not been given a chance to present her analysis of threats to the rule of law in Hungary to EU ministers.The European parliament voted to trigger the EU’s most serious disciplinary procedure against Hungary last September, a move that was supported by some MEPs in the centre-right European People’s party, the group that houses the ruling Fidesz party.Although EU law requires member states to act, the procedure has languished and little progress is expected before European elections in May.Hungary’s government refused to take part in the latest debate in Brussels, saying that the European institutions had been hijacked by “the political left and political liberals” for a political rally. Viktor Orbán’s spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, claimed that the rule of law procedure was a “political plot” linked to the philanthropist George Soros, the Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist who is subject to relentless attack by the Hungarian government.The government also singled out Timmermans, describing the Dutch EU commissioner as “an arm of these leftist liberal Soros-related organisations”.Timmermans, who is seeking to become the next commission president, rejected attempts to portray him as pursuing his own agenda. “In my work on the rule of law I have the full support of the president of the commission and all of the other members,” he told journalists. “I would be more worried if Viktor Orbán started praising me frankly,” in remarks that highlight the depth of tensions between Brussels and Budapest.During the debate on Wednesday evening Hungary’s government received support from conservative MPs, including members of the group created by David Cameron, once he took the Tories out of the moderate centre-right European People’s party. One Polish MEP, who sits with the British Conservatives, said the “European establishment” had been attacking “people you want to get rid of” ever since the moves to isolate the far-right Austrian leader Jörg Haider.Responding to such points, Timmermans said democracy was always invoked as justification for not complying with EU legislation. Hungary had made the “wonderful” and “sovereign choice” to become a member of the EU. “If you choose to become member of a treaty-based organisation, like the European Union, you by that choice say you will follow the rules of that treaty.”The debate came one day after new research from Transparency International showed that Hungary was deemed to have become more corrupt since Orbán returned to office in 2010. According to Transparency international’s latest corruption perceptions index, Hungary has fallen nine points in the rankings since 2012 to a level that suggests “serious problems with corruption”.Kovács dismissed suggestions that Hungary had questions to answer about alleged misuse of EU funds by Orbán’s friends and families. Kovács said it was “a very nice political agenda” for critics, but insisted Hungary obeyed all EU rules."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3776506.1548880623!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurses initial one day strike gets widespread backing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNurses on the picket line at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, on Wednesday. Photograph:  Colin Keegan, Collins DublinNurses began their campaign of industrial action yesterday buoyed up by widespread public support, but whether this can be maintained remains to be seen.Whether it was motorists beeping at pickets, or trending social media posts, there was little doubting the initial one-day strike by members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation seeking a 12 per cent pay increase, enjoyed widespread backing.Prominent doctors lined up to support their fellow health professionals. Letterkenny orthopaedic surgeon Peter O’Rourke said nurses had been badly paid for years and should not be subjected to “moral blackmail” to call off their strike due to cancellation of patient appointments.Tallaght gastroenterologist Anthony O’Connor tweeted that it was “time to value” nurses, “the glue holding our bockety old system together”. Accusing the Government of “clinging to money saved from their cuts like their Communion money” he contrasted this with the “obscene and absurd” overspending on the national children’s hospital.Meanwhile, Dr Cliona Murphy, chairwoman of the Institute of Obstetricians, called for an acknowledgement that female occupations are paid less than male ones. The average pay for a nurse was only €3 an hour higher than that of a babysitter, she claimed.Many doctors working in emergency departments, where the absence of nurses during industrial action is most keenly felt, were also supportive, but struck a wary note. Dr Fergal Hickey of the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine, for example, warned that if the strike was allowed continue, tempers and relationships were bound to fray and difficulties would ensue.“There is sympathy for the nurses,” says Stephen McMahon of the Irish Patients’ Association, “but that could shift depending on the impact of industrial action as it continues. If that happens, support for their case could be diluted in the court of public opinion.”The strike is coming on the back of serious problems in the health service, including the trolley crisis, the widespread cancellation of elective work during winter and staff shortages, he points out.So that the public can properly decide on the merits of the nurses’ case, clarity is needed on the “real cost” of their pay claim, and on any knock-on claims it may engender, he says.Trade unions representing other health professionals maintained the traditional silence yesterday when a fellow union is undertaking industrial action, but there is no doubt they are watching the situation with grim intent.Last week, Forsa, in advising its members not to undertake nurses’ work during their strike, took the opportunity to warn of the pressure for further pay claims if “some groups of workers” are granted pay benefits beyond those in the public sector pay agreements.Pointedly, it also noted official reports had found that staff retention problems were worse in the health and social care professions it represents than in nursing."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3776534.1548890141!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurses strike talks expected in bid to avert further stoppages","story":"A 24-hour strike by nearly 40,000 nurses and midwives belonging to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation is taking place nationwide.

Photograph: Colin KeeganGovernment sources expect that there will be further contacts with nursing unions over the weekend in an attempt to avert two further work stoppages by nurses and midwives scheduled to take place next week.However, the Government remains absolutely opposed to any general pay increase for nurses because of fears it would undermine the existing public service pay deal and lead to a spate of knock-on claims by other groups of State employees.Following the 24-hour stoppage by members of the Irish Nurses’ and Midwives’ Organisation (INMO) on Wednesday, about 6,000 psychiatric nurses will put in place an overtime ban on Thursday. This, they maintain, could lead to the curtailment of some community mental health services.The Psychiatric Nurses’ Association (PNA) said given the shortage of staff there would be insufficient nursing personnel to operate all services when the overtime ban was introduced.It suggested the Health Service Executive may seek to use managers to fill gaps and to redeploy nursing staff from the community to acute services.The HSE has said where there is a challenge in staffing an acute psychiatric unit or other residential mental health facility, it has available options. These include the assignment of nurse managers to patient care duty redeployment of psychiatric nurses assigned to day and non-essential services to patient care duty in the residential mental health services and seeking to negotiate a limited co-operation with overtime where there remains a gap.“At this point in time, management in each of the community healthcare areas is continuing to make the maximum staffing arrangements for Thursday with the least level of disruption possible. Until we actually see the commencement of the shift on Thursday morning, it is difficult for us to accurately set out any possible disruption.” Nurses are seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry healthcare professionals such as physiotherapists who they maintain receive about €7,000 more per year. Government sources maintain the dispute could be resolved “but not with general pay rises”. There is concern in Government that it would be extremely difficult to resolve “because the two sides are so far apart”.“We’ve no choice, we have to hold out,” Government sources said on Wednesday night.There is also a concern within Government at the cumulative effect of a wave of strikes on the health service including on the numbers waiting for procedures and for outpatient clinic appointments. If there is no prospect of a breakthrough in the INMO dispute,the HSE is expected to begin cancelling thousands more appointments scheduled for the next strike day on Tuesday. There is also the potential of further cancellations having to be made in relation to appointments scheduled for next Thursday if the dispute remains unresolved. This would add to the pressure on the health service in rescheduling appointment times for the patients affected. It is also likely that the health service will face two further strikes by staff in the National Ambulance Service in the weeks ahead, as part of a continuing row over trade union representation rights.

Mr Raab claims a meeting he had with Simon Coveney ‘was leaked in an inaccurate and misrepresenting way by the Taoiseach directly’ Photograph: PA WireThe Government has described claims from former UK Brexit secretary Dominic Raab that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar leaked the contents of a meeting Mr Raab held with Tánaiste Simon Coveney as “off the wall”.Mr Raab also accused Mr Varadkar of giving out “inaccurate” information about his Brexit proposals following his meeting with Mr Coveney last October.The Daily  and the Financial Times reported Mr Raab had suggested to Mr Coveney that Britain should have the right to withdraw from the backstop, the insurance plan to avoid a hard border if there is no post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal, after three months.Speaking to the Westminster Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Mr Raab claimed this information was leaked to the newspapers by the Taoiseach “directly”.A spokesman for Mr Coveney said Mr Raab is “badly mistaken”.“He was left in no doubt by the Tánaiste on the night that his idea for a time-limited backstop wasn’t a runner,” the spokesman said.“We made no details of the content of the meeting public and his theory of the Taoiseach leaking his bad idea to major British papers is off the wall.”A separate Government source said: “The story appeared in The Daily , which is a great, big, clonking clue of where it originated.”A spokesman for the Government denied the allegation, saying: “There is no basis to this allegation. Mr Raab should produce evidence to support it if he has any.”“It was leaked in an inaccurate and misrepresenting way by the Taoiseach directly.

He said the idea , weeks out from a potential no-deal Brexit , “of taking any action that would undermine the public service agreement would be grossly irresponsible”.Mr Harris was coy about whether the Government considered nurses had stepped outside the public service agreement by going on strike on Wednesday and whether they would now face the imposition of financial penalties.The Minister said he wanted to find a resolution to the strike and did not want to be upping the ante by talking about financial sanctions.“I do not want to be in that space today. The Government is not in that space today”, he said. Mr Harris said the Department of Public Expenditure would “legally consider” the issue of applying sanctions on members of the INMO in the coming days and weeks.The Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also insisted that the Government could not move beyond the current national pay deal.Mr Varadkar said he could not borrow to fund the pay increases but if the economy continued to grow as it had done, the Government expected income tax to go up by €1.2 billion and would give half that back to 900,000 taxpayers, including nurses.“Any solution has to fair to other public servants, has to be affordable to taxpayers, and it has to be fair and beneficial to patients,” Mr Varadkar said.Separately the Department of Public Expenditure and the INMO exchanged conflicting claims regarding nurses’ pay and staffing levels.Ms Ní Sheaghdha maintained that when the current public service agreement expires in 2020 nurses’ pay would still be lower than it was in 2008.She also maintained they are working longer hours than they were in 2008 before the economic crash.The Department of Public Expenditure maintained that any staff nurse or senior staff nurses employed in 2008 will be earning more in 2020 than they were then.For example a staff nurse on the max of the scale in 2008 (€46,541) will be on €47,431 by 2020, if they haven’t been promoted in the interim.Already the average pay for a nurse in 2018 exceeds the average pay in 2007. It was €56,223 including overtime and allowances in 2018 and €55,929 in 2007."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3661517.1539356993!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit explained why does the border matter and what is the backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A defaced ‘Welcome to Northern Ireland’ sign is displayed on the Border in Derry. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWhy is the Irish Border such a big deal with Brexit? The 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for border checks.It also established North-South rules and institutions that helped solidify the Peace Process. The border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure along the border or the creation of a hard border.So what exactly is a hard border? It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials and border inspectors, and potentially police or military personnel if there are security issues around the border.That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Why would there be a need for border checks? Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.What do the EU and UK want along the Border? Neither party to the Brexit negotiations wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.So have they come up with anything to solve this problem? The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement – the orce deal – that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal.The December 2017 agreement also aims to protect North-South co-operation, support the all-island economy and safeguards the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text – not just a political declaration – around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.What exactly is the backstop? It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.How have the backstop talks developed? Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries,.Northern Ireland would stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier initially insisted that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applies to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which keeps May’s minority Conservative government in power,\u0026nbspalso objected. They oppose any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.So what finally appeared in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop? The UK government suggested a backstop that would keep the whole of the UK aligned with EU customs union \u0026nbspafter the post-Brexit transition period.\u0026nbsp The transition is\u0026nbspa standstill period when current EU economic rules continue to apply over the UK. Under the agreement it is due to\u0026nbspexpire\u0026nbspat the end of 2020 but it could be extended to 2022.\u0026nbspThe backstop would be triggered if the two sides\u0026nbspfail to agree\u0026nbspa new trade deal by that time\u0026nbspthat is far-reaching enough to avoid Irish border checks. Under the backstop, the North would also follow EU regulatory rules set down by the single market for goods. This would be enough to avoid a hard Irish Border, but would still involve some regulatory checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.But there are still problems?Yes, while the UK government signed off on the withdrawal agreement, Theresa May faced fierce opposition to it in the House of Commons and the backstop was one of the reasons why the House of Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement by 230 votes on January 15th, inflicting the heaviest parliamentary defeat ever on a British government. Many Conservatives fear that once the backstop is triggered, there will be no way out of it for the UK. The DUP objects to the fact that regulatory checks would be needed on goods crossing from Britain to the North and that the North would have to follow some rules set down in Brussels.\u0026nbspIs there a way around this? It is difficult. The EU has\u0026nbspgiven the UK assurances that it will make every effort to negotiate a new trade deal to make the backstop unnecessary, or – if it is introduced – to ensure that it is in force for as short a time as possible. However, crucially, the EU insists that the withdrawal agreement itself must remain untouched. This says that the backstop remains in place “unless and until” another way is found to avoid a hard Irish Border.\u0026nbspMany Conservative MPs and the DUP are not satisfied by non-binding assurances, fearing that the legal withdrawal agreement is the key document.\u0026nbspWhat if\u0026nbspthere is no agreement?If there is no backstop, there will be no orce deal and no transition period. In other words, there would be a disorderly Brexit and the UK would crash out of the EU in March 2019. It is anyone’s guess how goods passing over the Irish Border would be treated in such a scenario but the UK’s chaotic departure from the EU could create all sorts of difficulties for cross-border trade and beyond. It is also \u0026nbspopen to the UK to ask for an extension of the article 50 process – its departure date. The other 27 EU members would all have to agree. So far Theresa May has said she will not do this. She has also set her face against a second referendum vote. Under a recent ECJ ruling, the UK could withdraw its article 50 notification unilaterally. In other words if it decided to stay, it must be allowed to do so.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe nurses may be out on strike and Brexit may be breathing down our necks but let us not forget the continuing plight of the scandalised innocents of rural Kerry, regularly enduring mortification by association as squads of Government-backed Garda blockade their boreens to check they aren’t driving over the alcohol limit.Thankfully, there are some who will never forget. Never, as long as there is a Mattie in every month, a Healy with every Rae and a Winston for every Churchtown.On Wednesday, it was the turn of Danny Healy-Rae to remind the Dáil how these abstemious people are being cast as drink-addled morning drivers by a heartless State acting on the cruel orders of Shane Ross, aka Winston Churchtown.He told the Taoiseach how Winston’s Road Traffic Bill “has changed rural Ireland forever and the social fabric that was known to the people of rural Ireland has been blown to smithereens”.“Many people have found they can’t socialise and meet their friends and do the things that they have done traditionally since the foundation of the State,” fulminated Danny, adding that the much-vaunted rural Local Link night bus is not up to scratch.Despite all the promises, an extension of the services has failed to materialise.What has materialised is plenty of checkpoints with gardaí checking people going about their daily business.“An elderly man last week was stopped coming home from Mass bringing his invalided wife home.”Absolutely ridiculous carry-on, cried DHR. “People taking their children to school in the morning – women that never drank – are being stopped and they’re outraged at what’s happening.”Which raises the question: should women who take a drink just suck it up?Leo’s Government has “turned the people against the gardaí”.The legislation, which replaced penalty points with an automatic ban for first-time offenders caught driving just above the limit, was finally passed by the Dáil last July following a fierce rearguard action by a number of rural Independent TDs.Danny has not forgotten the battle and neither he nor his brother Michael waste an opportunity to remind the Kerry electorate that their constituency rivals were not on the same side.“I must correct deputy Brassil who said on Kerry radio this morning that Fianna Fáil abstained. That is not true – 11 Fianna Fáil Deputies voted for the Bill and that’s the truth.”He added the Bill is also hitting provisional drivers because they can’t drive unaccompanied yet need a car to get to college or work or sports training.“What about their insurance?” the aforementioned John Brassil wondered aloud.There was an ominous pause. Then Danny wheeled around, pointed straight at him with outstretched biro and let out an unmerciful howl.“I never interrupted you and that’s the kind of blackguarding that you’re at when I’m representing the people of Kerry here. All you’re doing is interrupting me and that’s not fair.”In fairness, young people in urban areas can avail of public transport much of the time.These young people need to get on the road as soon as possible but, as Healy-Rae explained, they have to wait nine months for a driving test.The unhappy rural Independents got no succour from the Taoiseach who reminded them the laws are to do with road safety.“Last year fewer people died on our roads than in any year since records began and it is in rural Ireland where the lives are being saved. That is historically where most road traffic deaths have happened.”He understands the new rules make it more difficult for people to get out for a social drink, which is why Local Link was established.Then he looked across at the Healy-Raes, noting they criticised the initiative when it was introduced. “I’m glad to see that you now want that to continue and to be extended.”MHR bridled. “None of us criticised it!”Oh, yes they did. Michael Creed, the Minister for Agriculture, directed them to read a 2017 news report where he dismissed it as a “political ploy”.Varadkar then got stuck into DHR’s annoyance at the Garda checkpoints, which are not carried out under “political direction”. They aren’t just to catch people for drink- or drug-driving, or to check for tax and insurance.“It is also about denying the freedom of the road to people who are committing crimes . . . It is about catching people who are burglarising people’s homes and farms and businesses.”Be that as it may, Danny was not happy.“Taoiseach, you are hurting a lot of good people, good-living people” who “ never do harm or never do wrong on the road or never created or caused a fatality or did anything wrong”.DHR finished up by taking a swipe at Public Enemy Number One: Shane Ross, the Minister for Transport.His new law was about saving lives?”“I’ll tell you what ‘twas about - ‘twas about saving Ross.” To keep him sweet at election time.He challenged the Taoiseach to take Ross along with him, door to door, at the next election and see what reception he gets around the country.Leo was unfazed. People who haven’t broken the law have nothing to fear. However, he conceded that the waiting lists for driving tests must be tackled.Meanwhile, John Brassil was waiting in the long grass for Danny after his jibes at Leader’s Questions.“I think it’s interesting that on a day when the nurses in Kerry are down striking in the cold for improved terms and conditions that my colleague would choose the opportunity, the unique and influential opportunity, to raise his support for drink-driving,” he remarked.Danny wasn’t in the chamber, but his brother Michael was on hand to defend his honour, loudly.“It would serve you well to mind your own business,” he roared, up on his feet. And his poor defenceless brother, who had prefaced his earlier contribution by expressing support for the nurses, not there to defend himself.“Don’t be paying lip service to the issue now and trying to be a smart alec,” fumed MHR.He was incandescent. The heat under his cap must have been Vesuvian.The Ceann Comhairle struggled to maintain order.“I am very sorry, but he’s a smart alec, or he tries to be one,” whinged Michael.“But he’s goading me . . .”John Brassil had no business attacking Danny during Leader’s Questions. “It’s his tough luck that he’s not the leader.”As the Healy-Rae hissy fits were in full swing, Fine Gael’s Martin Heydon was already rushing out a press release for their benefit headed “Heydon welcomes Healy Rae’s U-turn on Local Link”.Having previously described the bus scheme on Prime Time as “a load of nonsense”, Heydon was delighted to hear in the Dáil that Michael Healy-Rae now supports it – “a late but welcome development”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3776371.1548884624!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"carles puigdemont i may participate in the european elections","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tExiled Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont speaking at Trinity College Dublin. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Carles Puigdemont, the exiled Catalan separatist leader, has signalled that he could run in European elections in order to pursue the case for independence in Brussels.In an interview with The , Puigdemont said he would be interested in running in the May elections if Catalan separatists decided to run a single set of candidates, rather than each party running their own candidates.“If there is a single list, I will support that, I will offer that, and, if necessary, I will participate on that,” he said.“I think it’s interesting for the Catalan process to have a voice in the European Parliament, and to put on the European agenda the right of self-determination,” he said. “It is important to participate directly in the European elections in order to say, ‘that is a European issue that concerns the fundamental values of Europe that needs a political solution and that concerns all the European countries.’”Puigdemont recently launched a new group, Crida Nacional (National Call), to rally support for Catalan independence and work for unity within the movement, which observers say has become ided along party lines, most obviously between Puigdemont’s Catalan Democratic Party (PDeCat) and the Catalan Republican Left (ERC).He rejected suggestions, however, that the independence movement was ided, or that the establishment of his new grouping was an attempt to bridge the gap between the different political parties.“Crida is an attempt to create heterodox space, and non-ideological space, to create more comfortable conditions for the parties in order to share the same objective. It’s in order to facilitate to join, if not parties, then voters.”Puigdemont strongly criticised the impending trial in Spain’s supreme court of 12 leaders involved in the Catalan declaration of independence in October 2017, which led to a period of direct rule from Madrid. Nine of those leaders are in jail. That declaration came just weeks after an independence referendum deemed illegal by Spain’s constitutional court, which was marred by baton-wielding Spanish police hitting out at voters.“We expect absolution,” said Puigdemont of the jailed leaders. “The only proof of a fair trial is absolution, because there is no case. There is no rebellion, no embezzlement of funds, no use of violence to organise a referendum. That is clear. It is a political construction,” he said.He said that the trial was “not acceptable”.Asked about the prospect of civil unrest in the event of a conviction, he said that he aims to “maintain the Catalan movement in a non-violent way”.“There is a risk, of course, to create serious disappointment in Catalan society if our leaders will be condemned to several years in jail.”He said relations had improved under the new Socialist government of Pedro Sánchez in Madrid, which took over from the centre-right administration of Mariano Rajoy, but he was disappointed by a lack of detail in Sánchez’s pronouncements on Catalan independence.“When I asked Pedro Sánchez what exactly was his political project for Catalonia, he is saying nothing concrete, and that is still the position. Nothing concrete, despite some announcements,” he said.Puigdemont also sought to draw a distinction between the Catalan independence movement and some of the nationalist movements which have emerged in European politics in recent years.He said Catalan nationalism was inherently pro-European, and “always linked to modernity”.“Our national movement is not based on ethnic elements. It is impossible to describe ethnically who is or is not Catalan. We are proud of that, we are the result of constant waves of migration,” he said.“To be Catalan is nothing to do with the blood, or the soil, but to volunteer to be Catalan. It’s a modern identity.”However, he added that he did not want to comment on domestic questions, despite a policy of supporting political movements campaigning for self-determination.“We support all the peoples who are demanding to exercise the right of self-determination in a non-violent way,” he said. “But every case is different. And every case must choose its own path.”He said that the departure of the UK from the European Union was a “serious loss”.“As a European, I prefer to see a more large and politically unified European Union, so Brexit is not good news for us. Secondly, I’m afraid it could provoke serious economic effects against both Europe and the UK.”He added that he respected the June 2016 vote, but was concerned by what he saw happening in British politics. “We must not forget it was a sovereign decision of the British people, and they have the right to decide their own future, and we must respect that,” he said.“As observers, we are very shocked with how things are going.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

People in the controversial programme were given $20 per month to hand over control of their devices, in a scheme that Facebook said was intended to improve its products.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCollecting such data is banned in apps that are distributed through Apple\u0027s App Store. To get around that restriction, Facebook relied on a special exemption that is part of Apple\u0027s enterprise programme, allowing it to push apps onto phones without going through the App Store.Normally, that program is intended to allow companies to distribute internal builds of unreleased software. Facebook is able to load early versions of Instagram updates onto its own phones, for instance, allowing developers to ensure they work before they are pushed out into public.Created with Sketch.How to stop Facebook from revealing everything about you Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Lock your profile downIf you haven’t done this already, do it now.

Finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. All of them with signed parental consent forms.Apple and Facebook have found themselves arguing over user privacy and the protection of personal data in recent months. Tim Cook criticised Facebook over its handling of the Cambridge Analytica crisis and suggested it was different because it chose not to make its customers its products – which Mark Zuckerberg said was extremely glib and did not represent how Facebook thinks about its customers.Despite those fallouts, Facebook and Apple rely heavily on each other. That arrangement is said to have led to problems in the past, with Apple unable to punish Facebook without threatening many of the biggest apps on its platform.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Newtownabbey, Co AntrimThe uncertainty is already having a huge impact on companies in Northern Ireland. “I know a number of firms have been taking on agency workers instead of full-time staff so they have greater flexibility if it comes to a no-deal Brexit,” said Mr Kelly. “So at a minimum, Brexit is making work short-term and tenuous.”One business owner based in Northern Ireland, who did not want to be named, said Brexit was already creating problems with trade. He told The Independent that a customer based in the Republic of Ireland had already stopped working with his firm “because they are scared about what will happen after Brexit”.“We have customers asking us about what we are going to do and about our supply chains. It’s really, really difficult,” he said. “It’s the uncertainty more than anything. Business does not like uncertainty and it’s creating havoc with us.”Trading partners across Europe are nervous about the future, and investment at a standstill because of the uncertainty. “We are holding back and keeping our cash because we many need it to get over the next few years,” the businessman said. “It’s created a real issue for us going forward. We just don’t know what’s going to happen and we won’t be investing until we know what’s going to happen and until we know what happens with the customs union.“If we get into the position where we can’t trade freely across the border our competitors in the rest of Europe will jump on that and take that trade away from us.”He pointed out that if a deal is reached, there will still be two years of negotiations to get through.\u0026nbspThe alternative – a no-deal Brexit – is even more daunting. “If we go into WTO rules, that’s going to create serious issues,” he said. “Within Northern Ireland we will have a struggling economy in the UK on one side, the Republic of Ireland is going to have issues, and we will be left in the middle trying to trade. It’s a no-win situation.” Meanwhile, firms feel like they have been somewhat abandoned by the UK government. Mr Kelly said that the government’s advice to business in Northern Ireland was essentially “not to do anything”. “It’s 58 days to go – there’s food on the shelves that has a longer shelf life than that,” he added. “The Irish government has been working with industries for the past two years. We have nothing, we’ve have been left hung out, hoping for the best. It’s unacceptable.”The business owner told The Independent that communication from Westminster had been “very, very lacking”. “The whole thing has been handled particularly badly,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We are in limbo, paddling away. We aren’t growing but we haven’t contracted, so that’s something – but that could change very quickly. It’s a nightmare.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even though the outlook for the tech giant is unusually cloudy, shareholders are still finding reasons for optimismClick to followThe IndependentApple\u0027s iPhones: Their price is set to fall in some markets as the company tries to address falling salesIs Tim Cook preparing to take a bite out of Apple’s unfathomably juicy margins?The tech giant has just released the figures for the first quarter of its financial year, which ended December 29, and they were every bit as disappointing as expected.\u0026nbspGiven that the company had already taken the hit though warning of what was to come, the focus was understandably on Cook’s plan for addressing the company’s (relative) malaise.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialiPhone price to be reduced in many countries, Apple saysApple profits fall as demand for iPhones slows What to do about the Apple bug that allows you to be snooped onThe most eye catching part of that was a plan to cut the price of the company’s slowing signature product, something that has happened just once before.\u0026nbspThe the price of the already expensive iPhone has been pushed into the ridiculous bracket in important markets such as China by the strength of the US dollar, to which it is pegged.\u0026nbspCook told the Reuters news agency that he’s going to adjust prices in some markets to the level they were at a year ago in local currencies.\u0026nbspThose of us paid in bombed out sterling shouldn’t get our hopes up just yet. He didn’t specify which markets, although China is a racing certainty.\u0026nbspBut such a move makes all kind of sense, particularly in the aforementioned where local champion Huawei has been putting out whizzy competing handsets to tempt patriotic Chinese buyers.\u0026nbspApple has been squeezing its consumers for a long time. Will this be enough to stop the pips from squeaking?\u0026nbspThe talk of prices being ‘slashed’ certainly looks\u0026nbspover done. The iPhone is going to remain a pricey piece of kit, and recent upgrades have been obeying the law of diminishing returns.\u0026nbspThe phenomenon of people changing their handsets less often is an industry wide one, and it’s an open question as to whether relatively limited price cuts in some markets will be enough to turn back that particular tide.\u0026nbspThe reason investors have less reason to be concerned than it might appear is that the iPhone is not the only string to Apple’s bow.\u0026nbspA notable feature of the results was that while revenues from sales of the device fell by 15 per cent, group revenues fell by just 5 per cent as other parts of the business grew.The money taken in\u0026nbspfrom selling Macs increased by 9 per cent, wearables, home and accessories (iWatches, speakers, headphones) put on 33 percent,\u0026nbspthe iPad\u0026nbsp17 per cent.\u0026nbspThe most important, and closely watched, line was, however, services.

But it is closing, and the margins are stunning.\u0026nbspApple’s shares have lost nearly a third since October, driven by a widespread tech tumble as well as its own problems. It has also surrendered its much vaunted status as the world’s biggest company by market value. Accustomed to dazzling investors, the weather looks set to be cloudy for some time to come and full year revenues will likely be down on last year.\u0026nbspStill, Cook is sitting on a near $250bn cash pile, and the stock’s fall may have been over done. Big investors seem to think so. They’ve started to order portions of Apple pie, scenting a buying opportunity at the current levels. They may well be right about that.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Holly Exley still remembers her most outrageous offer of free work.Exley is a watercolour illustrator with a decade of experience making artwork for top-end clients, from monthly commissions of animals for BBC Wildlife Magazine, to mouthwatering illustrations for the Esquire Food and Drink Awards. But not that long ago a luxury luggage company approached her to work “in collaboration” on illustrations for their products – in return for a free suitcase.“It devalues the industry,” Exley says. “Illustration is used everywhere: from advertising to animation, packaging to publishing. It has value, and illustrators spend years honing their craft and promoting their talents, only to be asked to give it all away for free.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhy do female freelancers earn less than male counterpartsSmall Talk: Half the workforce could be freelance soon, but ministersExley is one of hundreds of freelancers who have signed a #nofreework petition\u0026nbspstarted by The Freelancer\u0026nbspClub, a support network for freelancers in the creative industries, pledging not to accept unpaid work. The campaign, which started in 2016, is stepping up a notch in 2019 and calling for legislation to give freelancers more rights.\u0026nbspThe problem of free work is getting worse as the UK’s freelance army grows. The number of self-employed people in the UK has increased from 3.3 million in 2001 to 4.8 million in 2017, according to the ONS, contributing the most to employment growth since the financial crisis. Yet self-employed workers earn on average £240 a week, compared to £400 by those in full-time work.\u0026nbspMany young people entering creative industries like photography, graphic design or illustration take free work in return for exposure, hoping it leads to paid work further down the line. But the practice is not uncommon among experienced freelancers. In 2017, the Association for Independent Professionals estimated that free work costs freelancers with an average of seven years’ experience £5,394 a year. The law currently offers no protection and many creatives keep quiet for fear of a backlash from potential clients. \u0026nbsp“So many freelancers are scared to say anything, they are scared to name any company for fear of the backlash,” says Matt Dowling, founder of The Freelancer Club and a former freelance photographer. Since starting the campaign, he has been shocked by the stories of unpaid work and its consequences. One make-up artist couldn’t feed her children after her successful business turned into “an epidemic of unpaid work”\u0026nbspbecause so many other artists were willing to work for free.“I can’t imagine people approaching a plumber or a lawyer and asking them to work for free,” Dowling says. “But anything like photography\u0026nbspor design, anything that’s deemed to be a privilege, it doesn\u0027t get valued. Freelancers are accepting that work, and as soon as companies see that, they decide to save money.”Dowling started The Freelancer Club in 2016 after a company refused to pay him for photography work worth £11,000. It\u0026nbspnow has 30,000 members on a tiered payment scheme. Membership gives freelancers access to guides, discounts, access to paid work and legal advice. “Freelancers are told from an early stage that it’s a rite of passage to work for free,” he says. “It’s absolutely nonsense. Being an ethical company actually helps the bottom line. Millennials prefer to work for ethical companies, for instance.”Khandiz Joni is the\u0026nbspfounder of Novel Creatives, a booking platform for\u0026nbspsustainable and ethical fashion and lifestyle brands to find photographers, hair and make-up artists and other creatives\u0026nbspaligned with their ethos.\u0026nbspJoni says it has pledged not to promote free work through the #nofreework campaign.“We support this because we are freelancers and understand the very real and direct impact it has on our own livelihoods,” Joni says. “Also, working with brands that are in the area of ethics and sustainability, we feel that it is important that all parties need to be paid fairly for their work and expertise, if these brands can make claims of their fair wage principles.”Working for ethical brands and charities is just one of the grey areas Dowling and The Freelancer Club have identified. Others include work experience, collaborative projects like test shoots, where no one stands to gain, and speculative work, which can be requested by agencies for clients in anticipation of paid work.\u0026nbspBut Dowling says companies should never ask a freelancer to do professional work for free if they intend to gain from it commercially. He is calling for the UK Government to introduce legislation similar the Freelance Isn’t Free Act in New York, which establishes and enhances protection for freelance workers, specifically the right to a written contract, timely and full payment and protection from retaliation.\u0026nbspAnna Codrea-Rado, a freelance journalist and author of The Professional Freelancer newsletter, says the onus needs to be taken off the freelancer to go against a system that is already rigged.\u0026nbsp“The conversation needs to shift away from asking freelancers not to work for free, to demanding that companies not exploit the self-employed workforce,” she says.\u0026nbspThe hidden cost of self-employmentCodrea-Rado says it is not uncommon for well-established journalists to say that young journalists should never work for free. “That is a privileged statement to make that puts the onus on those at the very beginnings of their career to fight against a broken system that they did not break,” she says. “We shouldn\u0027t be telling young journalists not to write for free, it simply shouldn\u0027t be legal for a publication to commission a piece of writing without paying for it.“Exley frequently discusses issues around work and pay on her YouTube channel, which has 32,000 followers. She agrees that legislation is necessary to raise the profile of the issue and to provide security for freelancers as it becomes more popular for young creatives to go it alone.\u0026nbsp“I often feel vulnerable as a freelancer,” she says. “We don\u0027t have many of the benefits of traditional employment. We need a better support system to rely on and laws we can enforce.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

MPs voted on Tuesday to remove the Irish backstop from Theresa May’s Brexit deal and find an alternative, as yet unknown, replacement.

Newtownabbey, Co AntrimThe uncertainty is already having a huge impact on companies in Northern Ireland. “I know a number of firms have been taking on agency workers instead of full-time staff so they have greater flexibility if it comes to a no-deal Brexit,” said Mr Kelly. “So at a minimum, Brexit is making work short-term and tenuous.”One business owner based in Northern Ireland, who did not want to be named, said Brexit was already creating problems with trade. He told The Independent that a customer based in the Republic of Ireland had already stopped working with his firm “because they are scared about what will happen after Brexit”.“We have customers asking us about what we are going to do and about our supply chains. It’s really, really difficult,” he said. “It’s the uncertainty more than anything. Business does not like uncertainty and it’s creating havoc with us.”Trading partners across Europe are nervous about the future, and investment at a standstill because of the uncertainty. “We are holding back and keeping our cash because we many need it to get over the next few years,” the businessman said. “It’s created a real issue for us going forward. We just don’t know what’s going to happen and we won’t be investing until we know what’s going to happen and until we know what happens with the customs union.“If we get into the position where we can’t trade freely across the border our competitors in the rest of Europe will jump on that and take that trade away from us.”He pointed out that if a deal is reached, there will still be two years of negotiations to get through.\u0026nbspThe alternative – a no-deal Brexit – is even more daunting. “If we go into WTO rules, that’s going to create serious issues,” he said. “Within Northern Ireland we will have a struggling economy in the UK on one side, the Republic of Ireland is going to have issues, and we will be left in the middle trying to trade. It’s a no-win situation.” Meanwhile, firms feel like they have been somewhat abandoned by the UK government. Mr Kelly said that the government’s advice to business in Northern Ireland was essentially “not to do anything”. “It’s 58 days to go – there’s food on the shelves that has a longer shelf life than that,” he added. “The Irish government has been working with industries for the past two years. We have nothing, we’ve have been left hung out, hoping for the best. It’s unacceptable.”The business owner told The Independent that communication from Westminster had been “very, very lacking”. “The whole thing has been handled particularly badly,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We are in limbo, paddling away. We aren’t growing but we haven’t contracted, so that’s something – but that could change very quickly. It’s a nightmare.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company.

But no guarantee on funding has been given after 2020, leaving maintained nursery schools unable to plan and budget for the future.Government must take ‘urgent action’ to stop nursery school closuresMs Powell, who is chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Nursery Schools, Nursery and Reception Classes, said: “The loss of maintained nursery schools would be a terrible act of social vandalism.“Unless action is taken we could see the mass closure of these vital institutions, with tens of thousands of children losing the specialist care that is making all the difference in closing the social mobility gap.“Whilst we often hear warm words about the excellent education nursery schools provide, this needs to be urgently backed up by secure, long term funding, so that we can safeguard the future of nursery schools across the country.”Beatrice Merrick, chief executive of national early years charity Early Education, said: “Without the supplementary funding virtually all nursery schools are at risk of closure.“Most have been through multiple rounds of funding cuts already, have restructured and cut costs wherever they can, and in an increasing number of cases now have recurrent deficits, so trying to find ways to cope with the loss of an average of a third of their budgets is just untenable.”Nadhim Zahawi, minister for children and families, said: “We want every child to have the best start in life, which is why we are spending more money than ever before to support early years education and childcare – around £6bn a year by 2020.\u0026nbsp“However, we recognise the need to monitor costs and the childcare provider market.“Maintained nursery schools make a valuable contribution to improving the lives of some of our most disadvantaged children, which is why we are providing local authorities with around £60m a year up until 2019-2020 to protect maintained nursery schools funding.“The position beyond this will be determined by the next spending review.”Department for EducationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Poor students may therefore be more inclined to live at home and unless there is a high-tariff university nearby, this will restrict their choice.”Cambridge to offer \u0027dozens\u0027 of poorer students free year of studyMr Barton called on the government and top universities to do more to widen access. “The student loans system stacks the odds against those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds,” he added.A spokesperson for the Russell Group said: “These are sobering figures and they should strengthen our resolve to continue opening up top universities to young people from all walks of life.\u0026nbspThis is a big, complex social problem with no quick fixes – but recent years have seen important progress and universities, schools, government and parents must work together to keep it on track.”Sir Peter Lampl, founder of social mobility charity Sutton Trust, told The Independent: “It is worrying to see that there has been limited progress in closing the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students getting into top universities.\u0026nbspAll young people, regardless of their background, should have a fair chance to get into these top institutions.”He added: “Young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are often not getting the advice and support they need in a highly competitive admissions process.“It is vital that we ensure that all young people, regardless of where they live or go to school, have access to high quality careers advice and guidance that allows them to make informed choices.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company has only once before cut iPhone prices, shortly after it debuted in 2007.Apple did not say in which countries it would adjust iPhone prices. Resellers in China already began cutting iPhone prices earlier this month after Apple lowered its sales forecast for the quarter ended in December.Apple profits fall as demand for iPhones slowsThe company priced its new iPhone XS, which was released in September, at $999, the same price in U.S. dollars as its predecessor, 2017\u0027s iPhone X.That worked for U.S. consumers, but in countries such as China and Turkey the local currency had fallen so much against the surging U.S. dollar, it made the phone significantly pricier than its predecessor a year before. Apple had essentially asked the consumer to bear the cost of the strengthening dollar.On Tuesday, Cook said Apple will adjust foreign prices in some markets by resetting them at or close to what they were one year before in local currencies. Effectively that means Apple will absorb the cost of the strengthening dollar.We\u0027ve decided to go back to (iPhone prices) more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago, in hopes of helping the sales in those areas, Cook told Reuters in an interview.In the company\u0027s quarterly earnings call on Tuesday, Cook also highlighted the impact of foreign exchange problems in Turkey, where he said the local lira had depreciated by 33 percent against the dollar and Apple\u0027s sales were down by $700 million from the previous year. In November, Apple also cited currency pressure on its prices in Brazil, India and Russia.Apple has not said when or how often it might reset its prices because of foreign currency changes.Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the price adjustments may not extend to its services business, which includes Apple Music and the App Store.While that unit beat analyst expectations with $10.8 billion in sales in the quarter ended in December, growth has slowed compared to previous years.Maestri said slower growth was partly because prices rose for users in non-U.S. markets.Roughly 60 percent of our services business is outside the United States, and as you know, the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months, Maestri said. And in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the same year, the company\u0027s shares dropped 30 per cent.\u0026nbspJosie Cox\u0026nbspexplains how\u0026nbspit got there and where it\u0027s going nextClick to followThe IndependentApple Park, the new headquarters in Cupertino designed by Lord Norman Foster, cost roughly $5bn, and will house 13,000 employees when everyone has moved inFor an interview published in the\u0026nbspFinancial Times\u0026nbspback in 2006, journalist Richard Waters hauled himself to a nondescript corner of the Californian city of San Jose to meet with a corpulent computer scientist called Steve. As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s. In a world of instant gratification, it’s becoming clear that he who fails to innovate is lost. Perhaps, just perhaps, that will prove Apple’s greatest obstacle yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

cold to a wide swath of the eastern United States on Tuesday, stretching from the Dakotas through Maine, with snow expected as far south as Alabama and Georgia.Cities in the Midwest opened warming shelters as temperatures plummeted well below zero degrees Fahrenheit (minus 17.8 degrees Celsius). Regional governments closed hundreds of schools and airlines canceled more than 1,000 flights, including many to Atlanta days before the National Football League\u0027s Super Bowl.The Midwest will be the hardest-hit area, with a life-threatening wind chill bringing temperatures down as low as minus 50F (minus 46C) in the Chicago area and northern Illinois by Tuesday evening, the National Weather Service reported.This storm poses a serious threat to the well-being of people around the state, and we will use every tool at our disposal to keep our residents safe, said Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker in a statement on Tuesday.As much as two feet (60 cm) of snow was forecast in Wisconsin, and six inches (15 cm) in Illinois.Listen to the people in your area ...

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

However, there may be a\u0026nbspsolution through the use of natural alternatives and ultrasound, says Madeleine BussemakerClick to followThe IndependentThere are more natural alternatives out there if you want to change your lookDo you really know what you’re putting on your hair? Many hair dyes you can buy in the shops or hairdresser\u0026nbspcontain toxic chemicals\u0026nbspthat can cause skin problems or even increase the chances of DNA mutations (a potential cause of cancer).As a result (and to save money), many people are turning to supposed natural alternatives, with the internet showcasing a\u0026nbspplethora of homemade and plant-based concoctions. Yet very few of these provide much evidence that they colour hair.My colleagues and I recently conducted research to see if ultrasound, which is used to encourage fabrics to absorb dyes, could also help natural hair colours to be more effective. But while the results were positive, we also found that the treatment – and some of the natural dyes themselves – can also cause hair damage.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHair dyes work by filling strands of hair with coloured chemicals, which enter through the hair’s pores. In permanent dyes, two types of molecule go through these holes and then react to form a bigger type of molecule that is too large to come out again.Frequent hair dye use linked to increased breast cancer riskSemi-permanent dyes, meanwhile, only penetrate the outer layers of the hair and use chemicals that like to stick to the keratin protein in hair. In both cases, alkaline solutions such as ammonia can help to swell the hair, open up the hair cuticles and widen the pores to improve penetration and enhance the colour.A huge range of natural products are recommended online for covering grey hairs, creating highlights or even changing the entire hair colour. Suggested substances include\u0026nbspcoffee, tea, beetroot, carrots,\u0026nbsponion skins, nigella seeds, and a tasty concoction of\u0026nbspvinegar and soy sauce. Since these are all things we eat, they are inherently non-toxic, but most articles that recommend them suggest reapplying every week or fortnight and provide little evidence they actually work.A common suggestion for highlighting is to use\u0026nbsplemon juice, honey and sunlight. The sun’s ultraviolet rays damage hair melanin which results in a yellowed colour, and the small amount of citric acid in lemon juice can speed up this reaction. But the acid can also shrink the shaft of each strand, leaving hair thinner, and strips the hair of essential oils\u0026nbspand moisture.\u0026nbspYou can also buy hair dyes that use naturally derived ingredients. If you don’t mind having purple hair, one natural ingredient that has been shown to work\u0026nbspis blackcurrant extract. However, the most common ingredients in natural dyes are henna or indigo, with henna’s use dating back to the\u0026nbspancient Egyptians. When mixed with indigo, henna can create a range of shades from brown to black. These colour extracts work in a similar manner to temporary dyes and are absorbed onto the surface of the hair. But like other plant-based dyes, henna treatments are\u0026nbsplimited by\u0026nbsptheir messiness and the need to frequently reapply themTo see if we could improve the hair dyeing properties of natural hair dyes, my colleagues and I\u0026nbsprecently tested\u0026nbspthe effects of ultrasound on samples of goat hair. Much to the relief of the university ethics review board, this didn’t involve taking a goat to the local hairdresser. Samples of light-coloured goat hair provide a consistent source for testing and it has similar properties to human hair.We already know that ultrasound can improve the performance of natural dyes on\u0026nbspwool,\u0026nbspsilk\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcotton. It creates a pressure wave in liquids that grows and collapses tiny bubbles, creating microturbulence that, depending on the\u0026nbspultrasound’s characteristics, can help the liquid’s molecules move around faster.Under certain conditions, ultrasound can also open up the pores of\u0026nbspnatural materials. Our results showed that, with the right settings, ultrasound could halve the typical two-hour dyeing time of henna-based dyes.But we also took magnified images of the hair using a scanning electron microscope before and after different treatments. These showed that, when ultrasound was applied for long enough, it changed the hair structure, creating a different shape hair follicle that has previously been seen in\u0026nbspectodermal dysplasia patients.In some cases, there was also some surface damage to the hair, most likely from erosion caused by the ultrasonic bubbles collapsing near or on the hair surface. The images also showed that henna-based dye can damage the outer layer or cuticle of hair, which is typically linked to dry and damaged hair.Overall, ultrasound under the right conditions was able to create a more intense colour that was more resistant to washing than using the henna dye on its own, and without damaging the hairOverall, ultrasound under the right conditions was able to create a more intense colour that was more resistant to washing than using the henna dye on its own, and without damaging the hair. But before you go sticking your head in an ultrasonic bath, we need to work out all safety implications.Our next step will be to look at how ultrasound can be used in the best way to enhance different dyeing formulations without damaging hair and how this can be used in the real world.So far, it doesn’t look like there are any natural hair dyes without their downsides. But there is definitely room for new products that don’t involve smearing smelly, sticky food into your hair.Madeleine Bussemaker is a lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Surrey.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll. Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

But does one exist? Ben Chu looks at the evidenceClick to followThe IndependentIs the prime minister looking for something that isn’t actually there?Theresa May is returning to Brussels to try to renegotiate the European Union withdrawal agreement to make it acceptable to a majority of MPs in the House of Commons.But what will she ask for?On Tuesday night almost all of her party’s MPs and\u0026nbspa majority of the Commons voted in favour of an amendment put forward by the senior Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady calling for the Irish backstop (the insurance clause that says the entire UK will remain in an EU customs union if there is no EU free trade deal struck that manages to avoid a hard border in Ireland) in the withdrawal agreement to be replaced with unspecified “alternative arrangements”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialDowning Street’s logic is that, if the EU agrees\u0026nbspto this, the agreement she brings back will finally make it through the Commons.But what might these alternative arrangements be? Even if the EU was prepared to reopen the withdrawal agreement, do they really exist?How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?The “Malthouse Compromise”, a proposal put together by Tory MPs from both wings of the party, refers to a “protocol” to replace the backstop in a document put out last month called “A better deal”. This was written by Shanker Singham of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a think tank with opaque funding.This protocol offers various technological and procedural measures – including, among other things, customs checks away from the border and a new regime of regulatory equivalence between the UK and EU – which would supposedly eliminate any new frictions on the Irish border as a result of the UK leaving the EU customs union and single market.But how credible is it?Dr Katy Hayward of Queen’s University Belfast says its provisions for policing standards and preventing smuggling would not be secure.Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform agrees that the document is not\u0026nbspcredible in terms of policing.“Can you do it without physical infrastructure? Maybe. Can you do it without a significant uptick in ‘associated checks’? I don’t think so. Would it still constitute a border in many peoples’ minds and be disruptive?

Still,\u0026nbspit would be foolish not to listen to the concerns of a group of companies that between them sell about half the\u0026nbspnation’s groceries.Their warning is backed up by evidence from several sources. Government figures show the UK produces 48.7 per cent of the food it eats and the proportion has been steadily declining. The rest is imported, with about two thirds of that coming from the EU.\u0026nbspAdditional border checks on thousands of containers of food each year could mean significant delays which are a particular problem for fresh fruit and vegetables (the very items we are most dependent on imports for,\u0026nbsp84 per cent of our fruit and 48 per cent of our vegetables\u0026nbspnot being homegrown).\u0026nbspEventually, supermarkets may be able to re-engineer their supply chains to restore the flow\u0026nbspof fresh produce but many goods will undoubtedly be more expensive.Rising prices of fruit and vegetables will lead to 12,400 additional cardiovascular deaths between 2021 and 2030, research published in the British Medical Journal this week estimated.While some have argued that Brexit presents an opportunity to reduce\u0026nbspour reliance on food imports and boost British farming, this cannot happen in the short term.And even if domestic production were\u0026nbspto be ramped up drastically, UK climate conditions will not be suitable for all crops. We could heat thousands of greenhouses of course, but that raises significant environmental questions.There is a saying among optimists\u0026nbspthat when life give you lemons, you should make lemonade.

The best way to do this is to support a people’s vote on the Brexit deal, and to truly give us a final say.”The fall in student support for Labour could be explained by several different reasons, but the concurrent rise in support for a new vote just as Mr Corbyn’s own MPs accuse him of prevarication over the issue is stark.At an event on the steps of parliament last week Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Created with Sketch.Final Say petition delivered to Downing Street Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Today the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetToday the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetLuciana Berger, a former shadow health minister,\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Three of Mr Corbyn’s MPs later moved in parliament to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a new referendum.The leader has already submitted the Labour Party’s own amendment setting out how he thinks the country should proceed, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign because it failed to fully commit the party to backing a new referendum.Mr Corbyn’s approach would require ministers to find time for MPs only to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.The Labour Party has been contacted for comment.HEPI sponsored Wave 5 of the HEPIYouthSight Monitor, which was answered by 1,048 full-time undergraduate students and undertaken between 4-8\u0026nbspJanuary.

Several members of his frontbench also dodged the vote.The spokesman denied the leader’s office had given a “nod or a wink” to MPs from Leave-supporting constituencies that they could safely defy orders over the issue to preserve local support.\u0026nbspAsked how Mr Corbyn would respond to the rebellion, his spokesman said they would be “dealt with by the whips office in the usual way”, without giving more detail.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentBut he added: “There will be some fraying around the edges, but we’ve kept the party united both externally and internally.”Mr\u0026nbspCorbyn himself later\u0026nbspsaid he was “disappointed” that some Labour MPs had voted in favour of the Brady amendment, allowiung Ms May a mandate to keep negotiating on her deal,\u0026nbspon Tuesday night.“I’m very disappointed of those that chose to vote with the Conservatives last night on those issues.”Asked if he would take disciplinary action against MPs who rebelled, he said: “We will be having discussions with them.”Remainers within the Labour movement, and also some close leftwing allies of Mr Corbyn, attacked the rebels for “riding to the rescue” of the PM.Senior MP Chuka Umunna – a champion of the People’s Vote campaign – said he was “angry” and disappointed at the Cooper amendment’s failure to pass.There were calls from some Corbyn allies for MPs to be deselected. Commentator Paul Mason tweeted: “Withdraw the whip, expel from the Labour party and select socialists instead of xenophobes.”\u0026nbspThe group who rebelled included veteran left-winger Dennis Skinner, Caroline Flint, John Mann, Graham Stringer and Kate Hoey.

It does not legally prevent such a scenario and rather acts a symbolic move.A further motion seeking to give MPs the legal power to request an extension to Article 50 - the Cooper amendment - and prevent a no-deal Brexit in March was actually voted down in parliament on Tuesday evening.But the Brady amendment has more significance. It is quite ambiguous, but calls for alternatives to the backstop - the EU\u0027s insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement to prevent a hard border in Ireland.Don\u0027t relax now, Theresa May – your Brexit allies are for turningEU would rather no-deal Brexit than abandon Irish backstop, May toldMay set for Brexit talks with Corbyn as EU insists \u0027no renegotiation\u0027 May wins backing to renegotiate backstop but EU says noMPs reject plan to stop no-deal Brexit in March Theresa May is using this victory in the Commons in the hope of returning to Brussels to negotiate changes to the UK-EU agreement.2 Will Theresa May be able to renegotiate the Irish backstop with the EU?While the Brady amendment does for the first time demonstrate there is a majority in the Commons for one type of Brexit, there is one very significant problem with the plan.\u0026nbspImmediately after MPs passed the amendment, European Council president Donald Tusk\u0027s spokesman said the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation. \u0026nbspFrench president Emmanuel Macron also said the agreement was not renegotiable.\u0026nbspExpect more messages today from European leaders denouncing the proposals, and a major confrontation between the UK and the EU over the next stage in the Brexit process.Downing Street aides admitted the task ahead look difficult, and Ms May herself admitted there was little appetite in Brussels for renegotiations over the backstop. But they highlighted her previous deal had been heavily defeated and that the Commons had shown what was needed to happen for the deal to pass.Created with Sketch.

Some of the contracts last two or three years, meaning payments could continue for some time.“As highlighted on many occasions, all commitments taken by the 28 Member States should be honoured by the 28 Member States,” A statement released by the European Commission said.“This is also true in a ‘no-deal’ scenario, where the UK would be expected to continue to honour all commitments made during EU membership.”The statement continues: “Today’s proposal enables the EU to be in a position, in a ‘no-deal’ scenario, to honour its commitments and to continue making payments in 2019 to UK beneficiaries for contracts signed and decisions made before 30 March 2019, on condition that the UK honours its obligations under the 2019 budget and that it accepts the necessary audit checks and controls.EU takes less than 10 minutes to reject MPs’ demand to bin backstop“This would help mitigate the significant impact of a “no-deal” scenario for a wide range of areas that receive EU funding, such as research, innovation or agriculture.\u0026nbsp“This issue is separate from and without prejudice to the financial settlement between the EU and the United Kingdom in a no-deal scenario.”Officials admit they cannot force the UK to make any payments once it has left the bloc, though they hope Britain\u0026nbspwill take up the offer.Though the EU has ruled out doing ‘side deals’ with the UK to soften a no-deal Brexit, the move on the budget contributions suggests the commitment is open to interpretation.\u0026nbspThe Commission says its no-deal planning “cannot replicate the withdrawal agreement”, is “unilateral” and is aimed at mitigating the “most disruptive effect on EU27 stakeholders”. It has stepped up preparations in recent weeks and months, with 88 stakeholder notices and 18 legislative proposals.What just happened with Brexit- and what happens next?EU would rather no-deal Brexit than abandon Irish backstop, May toldMay wins backing to renegotiate backstop but EU says noOn Wednesday it also unveiled measures to protect the Erasmus international study programme, confirming that it would honour the overseas placements of UK and EU27 students who were abroad at the time of a no-deal. This commitment affects around 7,000 UK nationals on the continent and 14,000 EU nationals in the UK.Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said last year that “the Government would not pay the terms of the financial settlement, as agreed with the EU as part of the withdrawal agreement” in the event of a no-deal, because\u0026nbsp”there’s no deal without the whole deal”. It is not clear whether the Government’s policy has shifted since Mr Raab’s departure, however, with the issue of the orce bill falling off the agenda and the focus moving to Northern Ireland.In September Theresa May said “the position changes” on the issue of the payments if the UK left without a deal: leaving herself room for manoeuvre.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

UK infrastructure projects.The committee argued\u0026nbspthat Britain should give swift and serious consideration to\u0026nbspcreating a state-backed infrastructure bank to replace funding the country will lose.Baroness Falkner of Margravine, who chairs the committee, said: “For the last 45 years the UK has relied on the European Investment Bank to invest in all manner of vital infrastructure projects such as Crossrail, London’s ‘Super Sewer\u0027, the expansion of Manchester’s tram network and Scotland’s Beatrice offshore windfarm.“The UK’s infrastructure, and the industries that depend on infrastructure spending, will be hurt if the government does not quickly find a way of plugging the funding gap that will be created if access to the EIB is lost after Brexit.“We’re calling on the government to give serious and swift consideration to the creation of a UK infrastructure bank.”\u0026nbspThe Liberal Democrat peer also urged Ms May\u0026nbspto come clean about why the government is not claiming Britain\u0027s share of €7.6bn\u0026nbspfrom the EIB as part of its Brexit plans.Under the terms of Ms May\u0027s Brexit deal, the UK will receive the €3.5bn\u0026nbspof capital it has paid into the EIB but it will not receive any share of the bank\u0027s profits, which the committee says could amount to €7.6bn.Responding to the report, a Treasury spokesperson said: “As we leave the EU, we will get every penny of the more than £3bn we put into the European Investment Bank back to invest in UK infrastructure. We also have assurance that existing UK projects will face no disruption from our exit.Brussels says UK should still pay into EU budget after no-deal Brexit“This is just one of part of a much larger settlement that we have negotiated with the EU, which honours our commitments and is a good deal for taxpayers.“We are investing record amounts in Britain’s infrastructure, with funding for roads, railways, schools and hospitals reaching levels not sustained for forty years.”Ms May was recently criticised for choosing to launch her long-term plan for the NHS from a hospital that was built with £50bn of EU financing.Liverpool’s Alder Hey Children’s Hospital received £56m from the EIB\u0026nbspfor reconstruction work in 2013, according to research by the Best for Britain campaign.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Following Brexit Day there will be a transition or implementation period which is currently slated to last until December .After a crunch summit at Chequers in the summer of , the PM and her Cabinet put forward her strategy for Britains post-Brexit relationship with the EU.One of the central points of her plan is a facilitated customs arrangement which will allow the UK to set its own tarfs on goods arrival in the country.Borders between the UK and EU would be treated as a combined customs territory and would see the UK apply tarfs and trade policies for goods destined for the UK but charge EU tarfs for goods bound for the EU.The Government believes this system removes the threat of a hard border in Ireland.If Britain leaves the single market and customs union, it may not be given the same complete freedom to move money, people and products around the EU.The European Union will only allow the UK to be part of the European single marketit continues to allow EU nationals the right to live and work in the UK.And being a member of the customs union would stop the UK striking free trade deals with other nations.Theresa May and Olly Robbins, her chief Brexit adviser from the Civil Service, have floated the idea of a scheme which would see Britain continue to collect tarfs on behalf of the EU for goods which enter the UK which are destined for member states.Labour are campaigning to remain in the customs union after Brexit while negotiating a new arrangement.After months of muddled uncertainty, Jeremy Corbyn announced in February  that his party would back the move.Labour wants to see Britain in a bloc where goods and services can move across EU borders without hindrance.But it is likely to stop Britain being able to negotiate its own deals with the rest of the world.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC: We all want to do bold new trade agreements but wed be better off doing that with the EU.Mr Corbyn said he wants a new and strong relationship with the EU single market that includes tarf-free access.But Labour Leaver Frank Field MP said the U-turn would rat on the peoples decision to leave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The government is recklessly drawing up plans for a colossal act of self-harm.Through continuing on the path to Brexit, despite having achieved no consensus on a deal in Parliament, the government is preparing to declare war on itself.The idea that the government has any mandate for this catastrophic scenario is ludicrous. The Leave campaign promised a stable new trading relationship with the EU after Brexit, not total isolation and soldiers in our airports.A Downing Street spokesman said: “Respecting the referendum decision means leaving the EU.The prime minister has said there will be disruption in the event of no deal, but as a responsible government we are taking the appropriate steps to minimise this disruption and ensure the country is prepared.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These people are ­consistent and have my respect.But there are just as many who are in danger now of sitting on the fence until rigor mortis sets in, coming up with process rather than substance.They are simply hoping that others will do the dirty deed and respect the will of the people.It is also, for every Labour and Conservative MP, the manesto ­promise that we stood on at the last election. We voted for a referendum. We promised to respect the result.We got re-elected promising the same, yet Parliament continues to sit on the roundabout to nowhere.It is time to stop the shenanigans and work across the political ide to bring our country and our people together.At stake is our democracy. And in a democracy the winner prevails.Of course, in future years, people can argue that we have got it wrong and that people are entitled to change their mind. But for democracy to be true and real, we have to deliver the mandate we have been given and leave the EU on March .The referendum ided people and families, with lots of strong and dfering views. But in cherishing our democracy, we now need to come together to deliver a Brexit that respects the people’s vote and helps heal that ide.In le we have to compromise. We all have our own perfect Brexit, me included. And with ten of my colleagues we have forced through a big part of that, guaranteeing in law workers’ rights, health and safety and environmental standards. We will be competing with Europe by being the best, not by being the cheapest.I would love to have been a fly on the wall when Theresa May told union bosses that she was meeting their key demands not just with a promise but with a legal guarantee. But then she knew it was only right, because union members were the bedrock of leave voters across the country.And, I believe, we can get more in the next fortnight. A clear commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment into the Leave-voting areas that have long been starved of our fair shares — those former coal, iron and steel industrial heartlands, the unfashionable places, the areas still manufacturing. I think, as well, that union bosses and industrialists can be brought to act as advisers to the trade negotiations when we have left the EU, bringing their expertise into play to ensure a jobs-first Brexit for Britain.A country, proud and independent, standing on its own two feet, ­confident again in our democracy, bold enough to compete by being the best, British workers making high- quality products and delivering high-quality services.A country that says it will be the best by having better pay, conditions and a healthier environment than anyone  in Europe or worldwide.Is that not something to be confident in voting for, my fellow MPs  Let’s get on with it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Along with the likes of megabucks Remainers Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd, he seems to think Brexiters are basically pond le.That theory should be buried forever after this weekend’s passionate plea from leading academic Sir Noel Malcolm for MPs to stop wrecking Brexit.Writing in the devoutly pro-EU Financial Times, this distinguished Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, spells out the essence of the Leave case: “Brexit is about sovereignty — and parliament must respect that.”“If the UK is now on the brink of a constitutional crisis,” he adds, “one major reason is that a signicant number of MPs still oppose any version of Brexit, and seek a second ­referendum solely for the sake of reversing the decision of the last one.”Sir Noel does not believe people voted Out because they were racist.“The most important reason was democracy,” he says.“They wanted to live under laws made by the people they elected. Immigration came second.What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are useless. Have a trophy.”And it’s a depressing cycle that will continue for as long as there are National Television Awards, live from The O.A ceremony where the categories may chop and change every year, but the stupidity remains ritualised.As well as getting all the usual winners though, viewers also had to endure a technical nightmare on Tuesday, where things went wrong — from the shambolic opening scenes right through to the unedited version of the closing credits: “With thanks to — Television Centre White City or just Television Centretoo long.”It’s always a case of fine margins, of course, at the NTAs, and the evening might have strayed into so-bad-it’s-good territorythe cameras had just focused on one of the Love Island gang when host Dermot O’Leary said: “Danny DeVito will be in Dumbo next year.”They didn’t, though. So a night bedevilled by sound issues, rotten acceptance speeches and foul Danny Dyer language was crowned by Special Recognition winner David Dimbleby eulogising the BBC and ordering us to be nicer to politicians, in a speech that could hardly be descri- bed as “mood capturing”.It’s the awards themselves though, that I know get viewers’ goats the most, starting, painful as it is to admit, with the fact perennial winners This Morning absolutely robbed Piers Morgan’s Good Morning Britain operation in the Daytime category.Given that Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father managed to scrape on to the Comedy shortlist, there’s also an argument that says Chunk, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold and Susanna Reid — who was styled quite magnicently on the night as Waitrose’s answer to Vicky Pattison — should have made that final five as well.Because almost no show made me laugh as loud or as regularly as Good Morning Britain did in .A glaring omission too in the TV Judge section — always won by David Walliams — which included X Factor’s Robbie Williams on the shortlist, but not Craig Revel Horwood, who didn’t take a two-week sabbatical in the middle of Strictly, cost the BBC £million or throw in his other half as part of the deal.The award that made a nonsense of the whole occasion though was Ant  Dec winning Best Presenters for the th time in a row, despite the presence of Bradley Walsh and Graham Norton on the shortlist, and the fact Ant spent far more weeks in rehab than he did in a TV studio.The mutual affection is touching in one way, of course, but it ultimately does neither them nor the NTAs any good at all and has robbed both of a glorious moment of redemption when they win the  award.Before that foregone conclusion takes place, please stay tuned to This Morning and sit tight until mid-March, when Dr Chris will be along with part II of his bottom-wiping masterclass: Flushing, FLU-SHING.Practially the only programme I watched at the weekend that wasn’t punctuated by uncontrollable sobbing fits from the participants was BBC’s landmark Holocaust documentary The Last Survivors.Men and women who are all in their late eighties and nineties now and understand that time is precious.When you’re a living part of history you also know facts are far more precious than tears.So in the words of the remarkable Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who avoided the Auschwitz gas chamber purely because she could play the cello: “I won’t give people the pleasure of seeing my emotions.”The very least we owe all of them is an audience. The Last Survivors is available on the BBC iPlayer and will probably be the most unforgettable  minutes of television you’ll watch all year.At approximately : hours, Sunday, Gemma Collins stumbled over while Dancing On Ice.The tectonic plates groaned a little on impact, the front row scattered like ten pins and there was a surge on the national grid as several million viewers went “click, rewind, play,” then “click, rewind, play,” again.In fact, by the time I’d stopped rewinding and playing, Gemma had “bounced back,”and Piers Morgan, no doubt angling for a Le Stories interview, had claimed it was “the gutsiest thing I’ve seen on a talent show” – probably since the days Piers himself was wedged in behind the judges’ desk on Britain’s Got Talent.It was an undeniably great television moment, though.A proper face plant, with a full Klinsmann snow plough to finish.The downside, obviously, is that it’s guaranteed she’ll be back next week, when Melody, Wes, James and the others will be performing to a Fairytale theme and Gemma will be clearing the B Fettercairn to Banchory road,ITV want to find a proper use for her.Click, rewind, play.Things remain cheerful as hell on EastEnders.Alfie Moon’s car has been discovered near some clfs and a policeman has the job of breaking the most awful news imaginable to Kat and the Slaters.“Considering the location and the evidence at hand, we would suggest you prepare yourself for the worst.”Big Mo: “You understand what they’re saying ”Yes, bloody Redwater’s getting a second series.

But she also says Britain will not leave the EU without a deal.And her deal — the only one on the table at this late stage — was defeated in the House of Commons by a record majority just two weeks ago.Tonight’s Brexit votes are not quite the final shoot-out between the dferent factions in Parliament. The Government has promised that MPs will vote soon on a new plan.Remainers and soft Brexit supporters in government are pushing to hold that vote as soon as possible.And MPs — backed by a Speaker who will rewrite any Commons rules to soften or stop Brexit — will force more votes on what happens next.Nevertheless, tonight’s votes do matter.One proposal comes from Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP.Her Yorkshire constituents voted to leave the EU by more than two to one and, during the election, she promised them she would “not vote to block Brexit.”Yet that is what her plan does:     MPs vote for her   amendment, they will be able to stop Brexit happening this year.Cooper has the support of several rebel Tories, soJeremy Corbyn whips his MPs to vote for it, she stands a good chance of getting her way.Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, Conservative and Labour, have an amendment that calls on the Government to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Dominic Grieve wants MPs to control the Commons timetable, allowing Parliament to vote on dferent ways of watering Brexit down.Labour want to present MPs with options that include, predictably, a second referendum.Despite drafting a manesto saying “Labour accepts the referendum result”, the Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer says in a second referendum he would campaign to overturn the result of the first.It is possible that none of these amendments might pass.Remainers and soft Brexiteers are ided about what should happen.Some want to delay Brexit, some want to tie us to European rules and regulations, and others want another referendum to stop it altogether.Evenno proposal wins a Commons majority, the votes cast by MPs will probably demonstrate that there is a majority to water down Brexit one way or another.For Brexit supporters, this is very dangerous indeed.Some believe they simply need to run down the clock and, in  days, we can leave without a deal.For Leavers who want a negotiated departure, this feels like a serious risk.But Leavers who favour no deal need to ask themselves, can they really be so sure they will get what they want With several Cabinet ministers, many more junior ministers and a Commons majority against no deal, it seems increasingly likely that MPs will ultimately find a way of stopping no deal.When they do, Brexit will only get softer and softer.This is why the amendment proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, is so important.His idea is to approve the Prime Minister’s original Brexit deal, but with the “backstop” removed.The backstop is hated by unionists, because to prevent barriers to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it creates new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.And it is hated by Leavers, because it ties the UK to the EU’s customs union, and Northern Ireland to EU single market rules.Brady wants MPs to vote simply for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.By avoiding a specic proposal, he hopes the amendment can win a Commons majority and, in doing so, demonstrate to Brussels that the deal they struck with Theresa May can be ratied — but only without the backstop.Critics, largely Remainers, say this is impossible.But in the past week or so, Angela Merkel has questioned whether the backstop is such a good idea after all.The Polish foreign minister has suggested it should expire after five years. And the European Commission effectively conceded that in the event of no deal, they would use policy and technology to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In other words, they proposed solutions they once dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking” when they were suggested by the British — and which could render the backstop unnecessary.But this is not all. Some European officials have floated, in private, a more inventive solution: that the UK and Ireland should form a British Isles customs zone, with Britain compensating Ireland for any new friction in their trade with Europe.So it is clear: whatever Remainers claim, alternatives to the backstop are technically and politically feasible.Recognising this, the Brady amendment would give the Government one last chance to negotiate something better.Yet Tory Brexiteers say they might not vote for it. They fear the ambiguity of “alternative arrangements” could allow ministers to negotiate an even worse deal, perhaps tying the whole of the UK to the EU’s customs union and single market rules for good.They do not trust May, her advisers, or most of her Cabinet and demand a specic time limit on the backstop.Butthey vote down the Brady amendment, they will not get what they want, and are more likely to get what they fear.As the clock ticks on and bottoms get even squeakier, MPs will coalesce around a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.The EU will have no reason to compromise, and Parliament will soften our departure by aligning us with more and more European laws.If Leavers vote against Brady, they will be shooting themselves not in one foot, and not even in both feet, but in the head.As the Commons debates the proposals today, Leavers need to start compromising with reality. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the death of -year-old Molly Russell.It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December , that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide — material which was shockingly easy to find.As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: “Instagram helped kill my daughter.”Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks. Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing. But this is the latest example of Facebook — and other social media giants in general — only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged  to  report having a mental health disorder — twice the rate among boys.In  alone, one in five US girls aged between  and  suffered a major depressive episode — one in five! Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by  per cent in the US and  per cent in the UK in a decade.This isn’t just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.More broadly, Haidt believes the “snowflake” phenomenon reflects that “helicopter parenting” leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and dficulty. But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it’s not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that eventhey wanted to, there is simply too much out there.They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it’s like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes — they insist — thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.But this argument just doesn’t wash. It’s very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other. Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-le violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, “a genocide incited on Facebook”.Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook’s culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.He even says they might start paying more tax. ButZuckerberg’s answer to “how to fix the internet” is “hire Nick Clegg”, we have still got an awfully long way to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But every binding Remainer motion to impede or delay Brexit was defeated.And there is no point Brussels bleating about the Withdrawal Agreement being set in stone. We know it isn’t. Some EU figures have admitted it isn’t. They could tweak the text, time-limit the backstop or find another solution.They choose not to. And they will stick to that as long as they believe Parliament’s Remainers will ultimately strip the Government of its only negotiating leverage, the threat to just walk away.Remainers, some in Cabinet, may well yet do that. Nonetheless last night should sow doubt in Brussels’ minds.The victorious Brady amendment demands a vital, legally binding change to the Irish backstop before the PM’s deal can pass, just as The Sun called for. Even a dejected Corbyn has conceded he now needs to talk to Mrs May.The PM needs to know precisely what she’s demanding from Brussels — and we’re far from confident the EU will see reason. It is still more likely Brexit will be delayed, softened to a point that could tear the Tories apart or halted.But, after last night’s staggering turnaround, who knows Corbynista MP Fiona Onasanya is a liar and crook richly deserving of a jail term far longer than three months.She must resign immediately. If not, her Peterborough constituents should sign the petition needed to oust her.We are baffled why the ex-Labour whip and solicitor received such leniency.

It was ­particularly silly to discuss Ireland before the main trade talks, since the obvious way to prevent a hard border on the island is through a deep and ­comprehensive trade agreement between the UK and the EU as a whole.That, though, would have given Ireland a strong incentive to get the best possible terms for the UK, and for itself.So instead, at the end of , the EU suddenly came up with the idea of an “Irish backstop”.It wanted Britain to promise that, unless it came up with a long-term ­trading ­relationship that satisfied ­Brussels, it would stay in the customs union and leave Northern Ireland under EU regulations.Stupidly, British negotiators accepted the backstop. Wisely, our MPs did not.The backstop would mean Brussels continued to control Britain’s trade deals with non-European countries after we left.It would mean placing part of our country under permanent EU jurisdiction.MPs threw the deal out. Then something sensible happened.Leavers and Remainers began to talk directly to each other and hammered out a deal that both sides could live with.There were lots of aspects of the ­withdrawal agreement that Eurosceptics resented.They didn’t like being non- voting members for another  months.They didn’t like Euro judges continuing to rule here even after we had left.They didn’t like forking out more than billion quid in exchange for the better part of bugger all.But they were ready to make ­compromises. If the Irish ­backstop were removed, they’d swallow the rest of the withdrawal terms.On Tuesday, the House of Commons adopted this position. The EU responded with a theatrical snort of indignation.“We stand by the agreement that we have negotiated,” said Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s negotiator.“The withdrawal agreement is not ­renegotiable,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission.But hang on. Juncker is simultaneously telling us thatwe alter our red lines — by, for example, agreeing to a ­permanent customs union — then the agreement could indeed be reopened.So there is plainly no technical or legal reason why the backstop could not be removed or at least time-limited.Nor, by the way, is anyone still ­pretending that, without the backstop, there will be checkpoints in Londonderry and Crossmaglen.The Irish government has confirmed that,there is no deal, it will not place any infrastructure at the border.The British Government has been saying the same all along.Barnier says there would be ways to carry out necessary checks away from the frontier.In other words, the whole row is about a border that no one is going to build anyway.It’s ­surreal. There is plainly no way the House of Commons is going to accept the backstop.It also became clear on ­Tuesday there is no majority for a ­second ­referendum, because the last thing Jeremy Corbyn wants is to have to come down on one side or the other.That leaves only two options. Either the backstop is dropped but everything  is agreed, or the backstop is lost and so is everything .From the EU’s point of view, it must surely be preferable to agree the bulk of the Withdrawal Agreement, including reciprocal citizens’ rights and the ­£billion payment, while finding an alternative way to guarantee the Irish border stays open.From Dublin’s point of view, the logic is even stronger.Insisting on the backstop risks,not a hard border, certainly more dislocation between the Republic of Ireland and the UK — the very thing the backstop is ­supposed to prevent.The EU has calculated the cost will be worse for Britain than for ­Continental states, since cross-Channel trade is ­proportionately more important for us.But, by that measure, it is more ­important still for Ireland.In private, some Continental politicians are pushing for a pragmatic outcome — one that minimises disruption and ­preserves the long-term alliance between the UK and its neighbours.You especially hear these arguments in countries that trade heavily with Britain, such as Denmark and the Netherlands.You also hear them from governments that want to ensure the rights of their citizens in Britain are guaranteed.But for Eurocrats, in particular the anti-British Martin Selmayr who has seized control of negotiations, this isn’t about finding an outcome that works.If it were, the EU could have signed a continuity deal with Britain easily.The truth is many Euro-fanatics are happy to inflict pain on the EU  ­provided they inflict even more on us.If their view prevails over that of the pragmatists, then Britain has no option but to leave without an agreement. It is never sensible to give into blackmail.If the choice is between No Deal and surrendering part of our country, we will choose No Deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The people who can’t get beds in our hospitals, or a place for their kids in the local school. All the while that £billion is being spent on fabulously berserk ­projects in the developing world.To her total credit, Mordaunt has said that our current level of spending on overseas aid is unsustainable. It’s been rising every year. Due to a law passed by the coalition government, we have to spend . per cent of our income on aid to the Third World each year.So right now we spend just under £billion. And where does this money go  No less than  per cent of it is siphoned off to global outfits like that most useless of organisations, the United Nations.This is the body which sent out some dimbo Australian envoy to tick off our Government about economic policy. An organisation which elected Saudi Arabia on to its Women’s Rights Commission. An anti-Western and rabidly anti-Israeli convocation of leftie Third World thugs with chips on their shoulders.The world would be enormously improvedthe UN was shut down tomorrow. And the rest of it  Some of the stuff you wouldn’t believe. A total of £, went to a project investigating Tibetan verbs. Nope, not kidding.I would assume that “climb” was one of the verbs they were investigating. They use that a lot, over there. Thanks to our overseas aid, someone, ­somewhere is now able to say in Tibetan: “F*** me, is that a yeti  Run away!”Then there’s the £, spent on a scheme to stop Indian schoolchildren imbibing sugary drinks. India itself gives overseas aid and has an income rather bigger than our own. Where is the point Another six-figure sum was spent ­persuading Chinese people not to smoke too much — China! The second richest country in the world.Another one was to help Indian workers cool their work­stations down — this in a country which has its own space programme, for Chrissakes. So much of our money is swallowed up by useless leftie quangos and charities to keep themselves in jobs.Still more is pocketed by despots in the horrible countries they run. It is a source of corruption and dependency. It makes things worse. And when we tried to ert our overseas aid to some of the Caribbean countries stricken by hurricanes we were told we couldn’t — they were too rich!It’s a nonsense and a racket. If I thought our overseas aid, in its current form, really alleviated misery and suffering I’d be all for it. That’s why I agreed with the last secretary of state, Priti Patel, who wanted to give a decent chunk to the Israel Defence Forces, which saves a lot of lives in Syria.So my recommendation would be to end it all NOW.

Over to you, babes.SCOTTISH politician Ross Greer has already been called a “ginger turd” by Piers Morgan, and I don’t think I can improve on that. But it’s his ignorance and stupidity that staggers – rather than his hatred for Great Britain, which is something we’re used to from north of the border.Greer described Winston Churchill as a white supremacist, a mass murderer and a racist, and likened him to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. He says he is simply challenging the “myth” of Churchill. No, Ross, you’re not.You’re just pig ignorant, with a very poor grasp of history. Of course Churchill was racist. Just about everybody was of his age at that time.If you can’t see the importance of Churchill to winning the Second World War – against REAL racists, REAL mass murderers – when Britain stood alone, then you lack all sense of context and proportion.The more I think about it, the more I reckon “ginger turd” was an understatement.HERO of the week is the excellent Rachel Riley, who has been speaking out against anti-Semitism.

It’s a positive day but only the start of what will be an incredibly challenging process.”Brexiteers warned Brussels thatthey dont agree to fresh talks on the deal, they risk Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal on March .Jacob Rees-Mogg told talkRADIO: If they think that the withdrawal agreement is not negotiable, then we must leave without an agreement.Ex-minister Greg Hands added: Brussels is risking a hard Brexit.And Dominic Raab said: The balls now in the EUs court - theyve got to decide.Speaking in the Commons, Mark Harper warned fellow Brexit backers to give the Prime Minister space to get concessions out of the EU.He told MPs: Theyre not going to crumble tomorrow - were going to have to hold our nerve.The backstop is hated by Brexiteers because they fear it will leave Britain trapped in the customs union permanently.They want to see it replaced by technical measures which can carry out automatic checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Republic.Last night the anti-backstop amendment tabled by senior Tory Sir Graham Brady passed through the Commons by  votes.At the same time MPs voted against a motion from Yvette Cooper which would have taken No Deal off the table.But the PM has promised them another vote on the way forward on Valentines Day where Remainers could restart their anti-Brexit campaign."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004654124801.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may has 58 days to make brexit happen heres all the ways it could go","story":"But the PM still has to cross several more bridges before finally getting the deal over the line - starting with a trip to Brussels.\" data-credit\"\" data-sizes\"auto\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMPOSITE-BREXIT-FLOW-CHART.jpg stripallw\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  \" data-credit\"\" data-sizes\"auto\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMPOSITE-BREXIT-FLOW-CHART-.jpg stripallw\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Mrs May will lobby the EU to fix the withdrawal agreement by removing the hated Irish backstop proposal.If she succeeds, Brexiteer Tories will almost certainly pile in behind her and approval the new-look deal within weeks.She will also have a chance of successBrussels gives her half a victory - placing new limits on the backstop, but without removing it altogether.Butthe EU plays hardball and refuses to renegotiate the deal, Mrs May faces a game of chicken with rebellious MPs.The PM could press ahead and try to get approval for her deal as it stands - risking a chaotic No Deal Brexitthe Eurosceptics hold firm.Or she could work with Labour to cut a Soft Brexit deal which keeps Britain in the customs union.That would probably lead to a deal - but would enrage Tory backbenchers who would see it as a sell-out.Another possibility is that pro-Remain MPs would launch a new bid to seize control of the timetable by voting to delay Brexit in order to rule out No Deal.That would plunge Britain into months of fresh uncertainty with the possible outcomes including a snap General Election or a second referendum."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000465445834.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"downing street shake up brexit negotiators","story":"Just  hours after the PM’s Commons victory on Tuesday night, Tory MPs’ delicate truce also began to crack when loyalist ministers accused hardliners of tricking Theresa May.Arch Tory Eurosceptics say Theresa May’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell had promised to bring in two seasoned trade negotiators as part of a deal for their votes.The European Research Group want the UK’s Permanent Representative to the WTO Julian Braithwaite and the Department for International Trade’s chief negotiator Crawford Falconer to go to Brussels for new talks.But No yesterday insisted there were would be “no change” to the PM’s team, and it will still be lead by Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins.Angry former Tory leader Iain Duncan-Smith branded the U-turn “absurd”.After another meeting with Mr Barwell yesterday, senior Tory Brexiteers said No were having a second change of heart over the two men.Sir Bernard Jenkin said: “I am assured the Government is still looking at this.“The UK wants a free trade agreement with the European Union. The experts who understand free trade agreements and WTO rules should be included.”In a dig aimed at Mr Robbins and Mrs May’s de facto deputy David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, a senior ERG source added: “Some people in Government still want a customs union with the EU.“So it’s no wonder they don’t want the free traders in the room who will explain how it all works”.Meanwhile, a loyal Tory minister accused Tory Brexiteer hardliners of tricking Theresa May by giving her their backing for a orce deal renegotiation.All but one of the -strong ERG voted for the PM’s plan to win legally binding changes to the Irish backstop on Tuesday night.But some of them were accused of already bragging about letting her down to enforce their dream of a no deal hard Brexit.The senior minister told The Sun: “Some of the ERG are now saying their vote means nothing and that whatever changes she gets they won’t vote for the amended deal. Who knew  ”The People’s Vote campaign published new analysis yesterday that suggested many Tory Brexiteers were just using the row over the backstop as an excuse to torpedo Mrs May’s deal.Of the  Tory MPs who voted it down two weeks ago, only  initially objected to the Withdrawal Agreement solely on the basis of the backstop.Most instead complained about how the deal would make the UK a rule-taker, didn’t match the promises of the referendum, or said the “orce bill” was too high.Pro-EU Tory MP Anna Soubry added: “What last night’s votes confirmed is that there is no majority for either a ‘no deal’ Brexit or for the Prime Minister’s original plan – which even Theresa May herself now does not support”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Corporation bosses were hauled before the Commons Public Account Committee to explain a staggering poundmillion cost overrun for the E project, creating the soap’s Albert Square.During the -minute hearing, Labour ’s Chris Evans tackled BBC Content’s chief operating officer Richard Dawkins over specications for the project.Quizzing the broadcasting executive over an apparent delay between the BBC and contractor Wates in selecting raw materials, the MP said: “There seems to be an issue with bricks.” Mr Dawkins confirmed: “Before going into contract, we felt it was important to look at a range of dferent types of brick and, very importantly, bring in our production colleagues to review those bricks themselves given, ultimately, they’re the ones who will be operating the set.  “We did that in advance of letting the contract with Wates. “The objective for the ‘front lot’ is to replicate the existing Albert Square site - making sure we have that right was really important.” In a bizarre exchange which could have come straight from “mockumentary” WA, Mr Dawkins admitted the selection process took “weeks”. Baffled Mr Evans said: “Wouldn’t it have been easier just to go to a DIY shop and compare them ” But the BBC boss hit back: “It’s quite important that we replicate the look and feel of Walford and Albert Square. “It’s Victorian era, it’s an extensive build around the entire Square, so this is really important.”  He insisted: “If you look at the current set there are dferent shades of brick. “This is not just about going and finding off your local DIY store a limited choice. “It was the right thing to do.” The E project to rebuild the soap’s HQ in Elstree, Herts is costing licence fee payers a staggering poundmillion rather than the poundmillion originally planned. It will not be finished until . Mr Evans suggested EastEenders could have followed rival Emmerdale’s example. The ITV soap staged a plane crash two decades ago and revamped its set. “Obviously there’s the example of Emmerdale in the ‘s who flew a fictional aeroplane into... and they wiped out the cast and the set and rebuilt it,” said Mr Evans. “Would it be cheaper through a plot line to have something fall out of the sky fictionally and wipe out the EastEnders set and rebuild it as new ” Lord Hall said: “ I think we are now in WA territory ... but no is the answer.” Asking the peer what lessons the BBC had learned, the MP asked: “Apart from dropping a bomb on the set, what would you dferently ” Lord Hall said: “I think we have got the right team together but leadership is important.” He also blamed the discovery of asbestos for the spiralling cost.

Middletown nestles in the hills of Co Armagh on the border with Ireland’s Co Monaghan. Its name is apt, as it is caught in the middle of a history-defining stand-off between the UK and the EU. While Westminster and Brussels use the prospect of bringing back a hard Irish border as a bargaining chip, in Middleshyshyshytown, as in all communities either side of the -mile iding line, they despair at the posturing and dread the reality.Filling his petrol tank at the CFS garage, which sits over the road from the derelict remains of the old customs hut, retired teacher Roy Todd expressed his exasperation over Prime Minister Theresa May ’s U-turn on the Irish backstop. He said: “Throughout the Brexit campaign, Northern Ireland was completely ignored.“And with weeks to go, even though Brussels have said this border is the key issue, they’re just not listening. They’re just having their own little back-room meetings in la-la land. “The Tories’ only policy in Northern Ireland is appeasing the DUP. They don’t care about the border. And they don’t care that they’re playing with fire. “It’s madness.”   Staff in the garage’s Costcutter shop worry about their futures. Most of their trade comes from the South and they fear it could disappear, as long queues at the border put people off crossing it. It’s the same story at McNally’s off-licence in the centre of Middletown. Owner Adrian McNally has run the shop for  years and gets most of his custom from the South. He admits: “Let’s just say, a hard border would not be good for business. People wouldn’t put themselves through all that hassle again. These politicians need to get this sorted right away.” This is an overwhelmingly Remain area in a strongly Remain part of Britain, despite what the DUP have many believe.  Armagh voted % to % to stay in the EU, while Northern Ireland as a whole voted Remain by % to %. Surveys say support for staying in the EU has now risen to %. The main road sign that tells drivers they are entering Northern Ireland has been defaced so many times that it’s been taken down. In its place are placards put up by protestors, warning: “No Borders. No Barriers. Protest.” Only a few weeks ago Theresa May said that ripping up the Irish backstop would be “an entirely irresponsible thing to do”. Yet, in an attempt to stop her party from splitting, she just has. To some, it looks like the , lives lost in the Troubles don’t matter. During those dark decades, Co Armagh was seen as an IRA support stronghold, earning it the nickname Bandit Country. In Middletown, a British Army barracks was a huge visible presence and customs officials patrolled border crossings. After the  Good Friday Agreement the barracks were torn down, a housing estate put in its place and border crossings became seamless.   All that may be about to change. When a group calling themselves “the IRA” claimed responsibility for a bomb in Derry city two weeks ago, they refershyenced a hard Brexit in their statement. In response, Dublin’s Garda Special Branch are sending extra patrols to the border to combat an expected increase in dissident terror activity. A sense of wariness towards British reporters – which I had not experienced since the days when the only stories we came over here to cover were atrocities – is ing. Most people in Middletown don’t want to talk about the possibility of a upturn in terrorism but a pensioner, who just wanted to be known as Dermot, explained how a hard border could facilitate it. He said: “With a hard border, you have customs huts. Inside them, you have men in unorms that say to some people that they are agents of the British state. “Automatically, you have an easy target. Imagine the security needed to protect them  And who in their right minds would work there again ” Once again the Irish people are caught up in a British political quagmire that is not of their making. Dennis Brennan and his we Mary are from Monaghan town, on the Irish side of the border.  Dennis didn’t pull his punches. He said: “Bringing back a hard border would be a disaster. Pure disaster. We never want to see it again. “It’s been brilliant round here since the Good Friday Agreement. Peaceful. But you have to fearthe border s, so could the Troubles. “These politicians have to come to some agreement. There’s no doubt a hard border would be terrible for the Irish economy, but it could be even worse for the people. And surely nobody, but nobody, wants that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit barclays wins permission transfer","story":"NewsBrexit: Barclays wins permission to transfer £BILLION in assets to IrelandIts so they can \"continue to serve our clients within the EU beyond March  \"ShareCommentsByRavender Sembhy:,  JAN NewsThe banking giant received approval from the High Court \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBarclays has been given the green light to transfer  billion eurosworth of assets to Ireland. The banking giant received approval from the High Court on Wednesday for the move, which involves , clients.It comes as the company ramps up its Brexit contingency planning.As we announced in , Barclays will use our existing licensed EU-based bank subsidiary to continue to serve our clients within the EU beyond March   regardless of the outcome of Brexit, the bank said. Our preparations are well-advanced and we expect to be fully operational by March  . The move is designed to deal with the consequences of a no-deal hard Brexit, in which UK based banks would lose passporting rights that allow them toin the EUs single market, the worlds richest trading bloc.   In approving the move, Mr Justice Snowden said in his judgment: Due to the continuing uncertainty over whether there might be a no-deal Brexit, the Barclays Group has determined that it cannot wait any longer to implement the scheme. In light of the large volume of business to be transferred, the scheme contains a number of phased dates upon which the transfer of the dferent types of business, and the business of the branches in Spain, Italy and France, will become effective. The overriding requirement, however, is that BBImust be legally and operationally ready to conduct all relevant regulated business with the in-scope clients by no later than March  , which is the date currently set for Brexit. Several banks - including the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and a host of others - have set up continental hubs in preparation for Britains exit from the EU. This involves hundreds of jobs and hundreds of billions in assets being shted out of London, hitting the Treasurys tax revenue and denting the capitals reputation as a financial centre. Frankfurt, Germanys financial capital, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of Brexit. For its part, Barclays will increase its Dublin headcount by around  to  as a result of Brexit.

The Prime Minister met a wall of resistance from the EU’s top politicians who insisted the withdrawal agreement could not be unpicked. Senior figures in Brussels, Berlin, Paris and Dublin all warned that her demand increased the chances of no-deal Brexit as the clock ticks down towards March . Mrs May has admitted there is “little appetite” for reopening a deal in EU capitals, but has been instructed by MPs to try to strike a Plan B. She is desperately trying to hold together a fragile truce in the Tory ranks after a vote on Tuesday demanded the hated Irish backstop was replaced with “alternative arrangements”. So where do things go from here  Weve spoken to sources who are plotting the way forward.  The PM and her ministers will spend the next few days working out exactly what to take back to Brussels. Mrs May has already held talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Irish PM Leo Varadker and EU chief Donald Tusk. She will now try to nail down the detail of her Plan B. Some Tory MPs thought the Brady amendment just meant a few tweaks on the Irish border backstop plan. But many Brexiteers only backed it on the understanding she would rip up the withdrawal agreement altogether. She will meet with some of those backbenchers on Thursday. As well as trying to hold together the Tory party’s fragile truce, the also needs to push key EU figures as far as they will go.  Mrs May is expected to jet out to Brussels early next week after, as one No  insider put it, “the howling stops and the dust settles”. Government insiders are not optimistic about their chances of persuading Brussels to reopen the orce deal after EU leaders lined up to say “Non. Nein. Nej.” But they’re keeping their fingers crossed that the EU might have one last big compromise up its sleeve. Even the PM admitted it would be a big ask. But in order to deliver on Parliament’s wishesshe has to at least try. She is looking at three areas for the backstop - technological solutions, a time limit and a unilateral exit clause - all of which she has said would be impossible in the past.  The Government has promised thatit gets a deal, MPs will get a second ‘meaningful vote’ on her revised Brexit plan as soon as possible. If, as expected, Brussels rejects her pleas and she comes home empty handed, they will be given a fresh chance to debate Brexit on February  with a vote the next day. This will give MPs the chance to re-run this week’s amendmentsthey wish - potentially handing back control of the Brexit process to Parliament, delaying the UK’s departure beyond March  or legally ruling out crashing out altogether. Mrs May promised another set of votes - which she hopes will not turn into a Valentines’ Day massacre - to stave off a Remainer rebellion on Tuesday. WHAT NOW FOR BREXIT   Unless Brussels puts a last minute offer on the table, which looks unlikely, Mrs May will be back at the despatch box in two weeks’ time. Her party will be more ided than ever. Tory Brexiteers and the DUP will be pushing her to the next stage of the ‘Malthouse compromise’ which would ultimately mean leaving the EU a year later and on damaging WTO terms. Her Remainer MPs who stuck by her this time will be in no mood for standing quietly by. They will push her towards a softer Brexit - working with Labour MPs to get a deal that Brussels would accept. After years of kicking decisions down the road, it will finally be decision day for the PM - continue to appease her hardline Brexiteers, or work across the Commons in the national interest, but risk splitting her party.

His Kne Crime Prevention Orders being unveiled today will have ious options such as limiting suspects’ use of social media in a bid to stop gang rivalries escalating. The Asbo-style powers could be used to target those as young as  who police think routinely carry a blade. But officers and campaigners question how the plans can work and say the Government should stop “meddling” so police can get on with the job of enforcing the current laws.  Barry Mizen, whose -year-old son Jimmy was murdered in  in South East London, said: “They are giving the impression new laws will solve the problem asyou can control everything through legislation. “We need more connected communities and support.” Ann Oakes-Odger, who runs charity KneCrime.Org after her son Westley Odger was stabbed to death aged  in Colchester, Essex, in , said: “I feel frustrated that we keep seeing the Home Office meddling with sentencing... “Courts can hand down a four-year jail sentence for someone carrying a kne. “We have to use existing punishments rather than keep bringing in new initiatives. We are not using what we have, why would this work any better ”  Patsy McKie, whose son Dorrie was murdered aged  in Manchester in , said: “Are they going to stop everybody of a certain age to make sure they are not carrying knives  How is it going to be carried out on the streets  I don’t knowthey have stopped to think about this properly.” The measures could include banning contact with specic people online. They are civil orders but breaches would be a criminal offence that could result in two years in jail. Like with an Asbo – a court order meant to curb the actions of someone thought likely to cause harm or distress to others – police would apply for these new measures in the courts. They would last for a maximum of two years. The Home Office said the orders could include curfews and geographical restrictions, and force people to attend kne crime awareness courses. Mr Javid said: “I will do everything in my power to tackle the senseless violence that is claiming too many young lives.  “The police already have a range of measures to keep our streets safe, but there is more we can do to help them... “I have listened to their calls and will be introducing these new orders to stop gang members carrying knives in the first place.” Ministers have come under pressure amid a surge in fatal stabbings.Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said: “The Tories’ approach of more laws without the police to enforce them is pointless politicking.”Ministers will seek to amend the Offensive Weapons Bill to introduce the new orders. But Police Federation chairman John Apter said: “The Government is tinkering around the edges... While I cannot fault Mr Javid’s intentions, I don’t hold out much hope these measures will have the dramatic impact... he’s hoping they will.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa mays brexit victory not","story":"NewsopinionTheresa Mays Brexit victory is not quite what you thinkSanity is beginning to reassert itself, in the place where dreams meet geographyShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  JAN Newsopinion\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Hooray and huzzah, hang out the bunting and issue high-fives all round. Something has finally happened on Brexit.What has happened is that the Tories have agreed to stop screaming up their own bumholes and scream at the EU instead. This will come as a relief to all those who witnessed their -month act of circular self-abuse, but they did at least give us a new definition for windbags.  This has been described as Theresa Mays best day at work since  by all those people who have not had enough fresh air recently. Her great success is that someone  has been able to unite the Tories around a version of Brexit that is impossible, impractical and undeliverable.They even managed to persuade  of the crazier members of the Labour Party to join them in this unmedicated dreamland, where the DUP have long gambolled in the insane belief it will reignite their holy war against the Fenians.The Tories have, for the first time in two and a half years, decided what they want. The problem is that it is the opposite of what Theresa has done or can do. On November , , she told the House of Commons: The Brexit talks are about acting in the national interest, and that means making what I believe to be the right choices, not the easy ones.I know there are some who have said I should simply rip up the UK’s commitment to a backstop, but this would have been an entirelyirresponsible course of action. It would have meant reneging on a promise made to the people of Northern Ireland during the referendum campaign and afterwards - that under no circumstances would Brexit lead to ato the borders of the past - and it would have made it impossible to deliver a withdrawal agreement.As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I have a responsibility to people in every part of our country, and I intend to honour that promise.And last night, she was told to do all the things she didnt want to do on the grounds that doing them would be f***ing disastrous. What has happened is this: . Theresa presented Plan A, which guaranteed the rights and safety of .m British citizens in Northern Ireland, and was punched in the face by Parliament which snarled stuff em.. Theresa presented Plan B, which was much the same but had a dferent letter on the front page, and Parliament said well maybe so long as we can decide to say stuff em later, slapped Theresa lightly and sent her back to Brussels. The EU are about to say alors, but you people cest tres thick. Theresas people are already briefing therell be a Plan C. And I can tell you now whats in it.  Plan C will have moved on signicantly from Plan B by being more like Plan A. Itll have the same words in much the same order, with very similar promises about protecting those .m British citizens with a backstop, and it will get voted through by Parliament for two reasons.First, theyve voted on it twice already, and have been dragged towards accepting a version of it. On the third time of asking, theyll be ready to back ANY version, in much the same way a man who has kicked himself in the head will wonderits possible to do it again.Imagine such a person, and you will have invented Iain Duncan Smith.  Secondly, there will be no other option.There is now no Parliamentary time left for Theresas deal to get the necessary legislation through before its self-imposed Article  deadline. There isnt even enough time for the new laws we need to trade under WTO rules in the event of a No Deal Brexit.By automatic operation of the law, on March  all EU treaties cease to be effective. Predicted results include motorways turning into lorry parks, medicines being rationed, the imposition of martial law and Jacob Rees-Mogg declaring an ancestral right to eat peasants. Even those Parliamentarians whove been hoarding gold and have a Barbudan bolthole dont want that sort of legacy hung around their neck, so extending the deadline is inevitable. And fortunately, the law they wrote about all this allows for a minister to change the exit date whenever they fancy. And most importantly there is no other option for the border in Northern Ireland. No way to take back control, no way to superimpose a UK referendum on to a people who had a referendum on this already, and managed a % mandate on an % turnout. People traffickers and drug smugglers dont fill in customs forms, weve no way to police a -mile border with  crossing points, and as the cherry on the cake elderly IRA bombers are coming out of retirement to make car bombs for new splinter groups.The only way all these things were resolved was with an open border, that allowed the unionists to remain British while allowing the republicans to pretend they were Irish.No-one has an alternative to that, and it is a fact of quite beautul irony that the only way anyones going to Brexit isthey refuse to take back control of our sole land border with the EU.So we wont Brexit on March , because we cant. Well call it Brexit a bit later, and it wont be because all this arguing was just to get us to the point where we could discuss what Brexit will look like. And it wont ever BE Brexit, because every power-crazed demand the backbench fruitloops have made has had to be dropped - when courts ruled it unlawful, when public opinion swung against them, and when Theresa persisted them into submission.Her problem is that all the Brexit chaos has been laid at her door. She has been blamed for the indecision, poor negotiation and infighting, for a dud election and international humiliation.Yet somehow, through either great stupidity or brilliant stratagem, she has forced her party and the country to agree what it never would have done in , a year or even  months ago. Leavers and Remainers now fervently believe any deal is better than none at all, appreciate Northern Irelands problems in a way few ever bothered to do, andthe polls are right are coming to the opinion that the current deal we have with the EU is the best of all possible worlds.What happened last night is that the hardliners have taken their latest of , tiny steps towards admitting their dream is just that. Thats why Theresa is stronger than ever, why the Labour Party is on the back foot and the EU is scratching its head.Sanity is beginning to reassert itself. It says do something, avert disaster, extract cranium from bum, ask yourselfthis is a good idea. All those Parliamentarians who complained Parliament was being undemocratic are now praising it for embodying the will of the people.Theres months and probably years more of arseing about, of course, and any group of people with a fetish for rectal screaming are probably going to try it a few times more before they realise it hurts too much.Sanity is not immediate. But it is there, flickering gently in the place where dreams meet geography.

But buses up and down the country are being cut, severing these precious connections. “What we need is a national bus strategy, backed by central Government funding.

The wrap, which costs pound. has been criticised for lacking rice, meat and fish as well as being served in a flat bread.Chef Maunika Gowardhanm, author of Indian Kitchen, shared a snap of the wrap on Twitter , saying: Thanks but I like my biryani with rice in a bowl not a wrap. Seriously MS! She added: Just to put it in perspective, in India firstly there is no such thing as a veg biryani. Most places will serve mutton or chicken or even fish.

As a veggie its nice to find a sandwich I can buy when in a hurry.Meanwhile, Chef Vivek Singh, of Cinnamon Club, London, told The Times people accusing MS of cultural appropriation should loosen up.He continued: People in Britain love biryani as much as most of us from the sub-continent.

The -year-old Duchess of Sussex looked stunning as she stepped out in a pound, nude tailored blazer with matching pound, v-neck mini dress by designer Brandon Maxwell. She teamed the outfit with her pound. Carolina Herrera clutch, which she debuted at Trooping the Colour last year, and her classic pound Aquazzura Matilde heels that she wore for her engagement announcement. The smiling Duchess also wore her hair in a chic up-do for her first visit to the theatre in Londons Southbank since taking over as patron from the Queen. A chorus of cheers were heard from fans gathered outside to catch a glimpse of the mum-to-be as she stepped out the car.  She was greeted by Rufus Norris, director of the National Theatre, who reportedly said after the visit that the Duchess ‘has her own production’ to be getting on with and revealed Meghan had talked about her interest in Greek tragedies. She also met with carpenters, metalworkers and other craftsman preparing the sets before watching a performance inspired by War Horse by pupils from Edith Neville Primary School in Camden. It was announced earlier this month that the former actress was succeeding the Queen as the organisations patron, a role Her Majesty held for almost five decades.  The visit will no doubt have brought back memories of the career that thrust Meghan into the spotlight - and helped her bag her prince. She spent a decade working as an actress in television, where she was best known for her role in the hit US legal drama series Suits, playing paralegal-turned-lawyer Rachel Zane. She also has a theatre background having studied theatre and international relations at Northwestern University, Illinois, and volunteered at a performing arts after-school programme for children in underprivileged school districts in Los Angeles. And as we previously reported , Meghans father Thomas Markle made numerous sacrices so she could fulfil her dream of becoming a performer. He is the person who believed in this grand dream of mine well before I could even see it as a possibility, she previously said   Thomas also worked as a lighting director on two television shows. It was while accompanying her father, that a young Meghan got a taste of what le was like to be an actress. She was surrounded by famous actors, their glam teams, multi-million dollar budgets, and crew lunches that always included filet mignon and enough sweets to make you think you were at Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. As she went from audition to audition trying to make it as an actress, it was Thomas who put gas in her car so she could get to them. Suits was her big break and she described it as stealing her heart and being the Goldilocks of my acting career – where finally I was just right.. Her patronage with the National Theatre is a natural fit as she is a strong believer in using the arts to bring people from dferent backgrounds and communities together.  The theatre accidentally announced Meghans patronage in an online gaffe - a day before Kensington Palace was set to confirm it. It said in a statement: The National Theatre is honoured to announce thatHer Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussexhas become its Royal Patron. The patronage reflects Her Royal Highness’s belief in using the arts to bring people from dferent backgrounds and communities together. Her Majesty The Queen has passed on the Royal Patronage to The Duchess of Sussex having held the role for the last  years and has been associated with the organisation since its earliest days at the Old Vic in the s.   The Duchess has spent decades championing the arts and feels that she can use her position to focus attention on and make a particular dference to the sector. Meanwhile, Prince Harry in his role of Commonwealth Youth Ambassador, met young people from across the Commonwealth at a roundtable discussion at Lancaster House this morning. The Duke heard from young people about the issues that are key to them in the run up to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting  .   He also gave a speech and said: I can honestly say I feel more passionate than ever about the huge opportunity we have here. To empower young people across the Commonwealth, you who are here in this room today, and the millions around the world who are part of this global collective of change makers. Tomorrow Meghan will also be visiting the Association of Commonwealth Universities tohear more about how it is working to promote inclusion and access to education for underrepresented groups. While on Friday, the Duchess and Prince Harry are heading to Bristol where they will visit the Bristol Old Vic theatre.

Angela Davey, , was a married mum-of-two with a successful career before she got involved with a gang selling heroin and crack cocaine. It happened after her marriage hit trouble - and now her family have begged her to give herself up. Davey had been due to be sentenced for dealing cocaine after being caught during an undercover drugs operation. A close family member, who asked not to be named, said: Angela went from being a bright, well-educated person to somebody who the last time she was seen, was sleeping in a shop doorway in Norwich. Shes hopelessly addicted to drugs.  The relative said he feared the family would not get her back, adding: Her brain has changed. Everybody wants her to just come in so we can help her to deal with the situation. Davey had been due to appear at Norwich Crown Court along with David Teixeira, , from London, who was described as being the branch manager of the county lines gang, transporting drugs from the capital to London.

All three defendants admitted conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and were jailed for a total of  years.

Angela, from Norwich, Norfolk, is reported to have studied history at university and trained as a teacher before working at Hewett Academy in Norwich, and then moved to work at a special needs school. She is believed to have bought a house with her husband, with whom she had two children. However, friends said her le took a sharp turn for the worse after her marriage broke down.

Her friend said: “If she continues in this lestyle she will die.” She added that prison could be the only way to save her from potential death.  The former teacher reportedly ended up living in a camper van, before resorting to sleeping in a tent near a footpath. The new occupant of a semi-detached property in Norwich, where Angela is believed to have lived  months ago, said that rubbish and drug needles were left at the home. The -year-old woman, who wished to remain anonymous, also said that childrens things and artwork were also left there.

A study of , workers found more than half want their staff benefits to help improve their work le balance and  per cent want added extras which will save them money. And while younger adults highlight the need for help with housing, older generations are more concerned with private healthcare. Access to mental health care is also more important to those who started working this decade than to those who began their careers in any decade before.   It also emerged fewer than one in five are currently totally satisfied with the benefits package provided by their employer. And half of employees would leave their current employmentthey thought they could get a position where with more perks, with just  per cent preferring extra pay over comprehensive benefits. Steven Osei, spokesman for the Preferential Partnerships programme at Get Living, said: It’s no surprise that employees’ attitudes to workplace benefits have changed over the last five decades since the world we live in is almost unrecognisable now. “Employees are moving jobs more often, increasingly working from home and expecting to be compensated for their dedication. “To keep up with the competition, employers need to reflect workers more flexible lestyles.” The study also revealed employees who started their working le in  or later are most likely to want pets in the office, and free breakfast supplies. And the demand for company-expensed dental care has decreased over the decades, with nearly a quarter of older workers feeling it should be offered as standard by employers. This compares to just nine per cent of people who started their careers during this decade. Free tea and coffee is most valued by workers aged between -, with over-s the most likely to seek out an enhanced pension contribution.   People aged between - cite unlimited holiday days as the most attractive perk they think a company could offer. It also emerged employees who have been working the longest are most satisfied with their current benefits package, with those starting work in the s the least happy. Although more people who started work during this decade are currently looking for a job with better benefits than any other workers. But unusually, younger workers are also most likely to stay in their jobs because the benefits are too good to pass up.More than six in  workers who took part in the survey, conducted through OnePoll , believe their employer has a responsibility to look after their personal well-being.And workers agree they have become more demanding of their employers due to the hours spent at work, increased retirement age and the always-on nature of work making them feel their companies should offer more for their service. Get Living works with employers through its Preferential Partnerships programme to learn the challenges their people face living and commuting in the city where they work and offer a better way of renting.   Steven Osei added: “If a company wants to attract the top talent then they need to offer the best benefits, especially in London where the cost of living is leading to a brain drain. Since beginning the Preferential Partnerships programme, we’ve been working with top employers to create solutions for the challenges that their employees face when it comes to finding a place to live. “In this hyper-connected world an employer’s duty of care no longer ends at the office door. Well-being starts at home and we can support this by offering a simple move in process and quality, well-managed homes. “We know from speaking to our partners that this takes a weight off staff who are relocating or moving to a new city when starting a new job. We hope the success of this scheme will encourage more companies to take a vested interest in their employees’ living situations.” The most attractive workplace benefits - by age - .

Frank Field yesterday slammed the Topshop tycoon for trying to silence former staff who accused him of sexual, racist and bullying behaviour. Green, , vehemently denies the allegations. Earlier this week he announced plans to abandon a legal battle to maintain an injunction against a newspaper from publishing the claims.   But the Dailysaid it should only happenGreen agrees not to take subsequent action against his five accusers, who got payouts to settle their claims and signed non-disclosure agreements. Mr Field, the Commons’ Work and Pensions Committee chair, said: “The iniduals should be free to speak out, others should be freethey wish to. “These gagging orders are largely a rich man’s game.”The independent MP, who has clashed with the billionaire before, added: “He gave up on thebecause they have a lot of money but he is still threatening to pursue others. He wants his cake and to eat it.” The High Court this week heard that Green’s lawyers had sent a hand-delivered letter to a witness, to threaten her to stay silent.The tycoon is also said to have sent “intimidating” letters to alleged victims, against speaking out.  In court papers lawyers say he did touch employees but in a “non-sexual way”. Green, whose reputation was trashed by the BHS collapse, denies his conshyshyduct was criminal and describes it as “banter”. He dismissed comparisshyshyons between claims about him and shamed film prodshyucer Harvey Weinstein. Green’s lawyers told Mr Justice Warby that a trial would have been “worse” than ending proceedings, for which they are seeking permission. It comes after Lord Hain identied Green in Parliament in October as the businessman behind a court injunction to stop thenaming him and detailing claims against him.The High Court could make a ruling by tomorrow.

Most of the expensive presents are given to her on dates with men, whose ages range from  to -years-old. But the mum from East London insists that she doesnt have sex with them.She told Sun Online about how she was inspired into escorting while she worked in an office on minimum wage.  She was talking to a friend about her money woes who encouraged her to pay it off by working as an escort. I wasn’t sure at first, but when my mate explained I’d get good money and wouldnt need to have sex with anybody, I went for it - I had no close family to help me out and I was desperate, she said. Michelle was advised to start advertising via a social media site called Faceparty. Here, she uploaded pictures and explained she was available for dates. Clients began to flood in from ious backgrounds - including one woman. She added: Clients don’t pay me for my time - but,they want to, they give me gt.

She ensures she is safe in every situation, checking the location and escape points beforehand. Clients also request specic outfits and makeup depending on their taste. Michelle claims that many of her clients have fallen in love with her and she has been asked to move to Dubai by one client in her own flat - but she turned him down.

He also said that no human girl was as “hot” as Lisa and that they were “ per cent serious” about each other. But events took an even more macabee turn when Lisa died - and Yuma ate her.  Yuma is an entomophagist, which means he advocates and practises eating insects as an alternative to meat for environmental reasons. He is well known for organising bug eating contest in his native Japan. In a video interview with Asian Boss, Yuma said he bought Lisa as an African farm-reared cockroach and that he believed they could communicate with each other.

The day she passed away was dficult but I knew it had to come since she was a cockroach with a short le span. So now Lisa lives in my heart and continues living as part of my body.

Translating to mean “rich rice”, the dish’s main component consists of rice cooked in coconut milk, along with panda leaf and galangal root flavouring. A number of ingredients can then be added to the mixture. The most popular of which are usually crispy peanuts, anchovies, sliced cucumber and hard-boiled eggs.  Topped with samba hot sauce or tamarind juice, the rich rice is often served with fried chicken or beef rendang on the side. Its then served in a banana leaf - or bungkus - to keep it warm. Nasi lemak is regarded as being hugely signicant to the culture of the south-east Asian country. It’s thought to have been invented on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, intended the be a filling breakfast for farmers and labourers. But sold at roadside stalls and markets, the meal is so fervently popular it’s regularly eaten for lunch and dinner as well.  A famous legend says the recipe was discovered by accident when Seri, the daughter of a widow called Mak Kuntum, accidentally spilled coconut milk into a pot of rice she was cooking. “What did you cook ,” Mak allegedly asked. “Nasi le, Mak!,”responded Seri. Many iations of Nasi lemak have been developed over the years. It’s now garnered a cult appeal across India and China as well.

especially in this weather, she said.ldquoEvery parent that sends their child to school by bus is depending on the council to ensure that happens safely.ldquoIt is the councilrsquos responsibility as corporate parent to ensure these children get to school safely.A spokeswoman for Stagecoach North Scotland said: ldquoSince we started operating the additional school contracts on January  there have been some issues with capacity we have identied and are working to resolve.ldquoWe are working closely with Highland Council to resolve these problems by issuing school children with passes allocating them to specic buses to prevent the overloading problems we have seen.She added that in terms of the issues raised by Mrs Paterson an additional bus is now running to and from Croy.Thursday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119409.jpg","title":"Site for Inverness homes not acceptable","story":"Councillor Ken Gowans hit out at the application by agent Bracewell-Stirling for DMPM Services.He said the site was not zoned for housing and would pile pressure on local school rolls which are already well over  per cent capacity.ldquoWhile we need more affordable houses, any development must be part of the local plan, and this development is not.ldquoThis is likely to generate more unacceptable pressures on infrastructure which is already struggling to cope at the moment.ldquoWhile developers pay contributions towards education, it doesnrsquot change the fact that local schools are beyond full, and the councilrsquos school roll projections indicate these will worsen in the short to medium term, he said.Highlands MSP and road safety campaigner David Stewart also expressed some concern: ldquoI am mindful that the dual A will be at one side of this site and the rural B road will extend along another side of the site.ldquoAs it stands, this particular road has no pavement for pedestrians and this would be an issue that would cause me concern.Thursday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117111.jpg","title":"Work starts on new outlets at Eastgate Shopping Centre","story":"WORK has begun at the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness to develop four food outlets.The units, suitable for restaurant or bar operators, are being created by the reconfiguration of two existing shops fronting Falcon Square.Burger King UK is the first operator to sign up while talks are ongoing with operators for the other units.In addition, a new kiosk will be created fronting the Falcon Square mall entrance.

A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh.

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

A senior source said: “The UK Government’s contribution to the Ayrshire Growth Deal will be in the region of pound million. “It’s clear from the growth deal process that a lot of very exciting projects have been put forward. We are confident the deal can deliver a massive boost to the local economy.” The Ayrshire Growth Deal will provide signicant investment in the key sectors of aerospace and space at Prestwick, le sciences, manufacturing and tourism. It has been talked about for years as a poundm fund but the Scottish Government and three Ayrshire councils have all failed to reveal their financial input. The aim is to make key investments that will grow the economy and lead to , new jobs.  To do that the poundm public sector finance will have to trigger poundbillion of private investment. It is widely accepted Ayrshire has missed out on big investment deals as it has three councils scrapping for superiority, rather than a single strategic voice. Growth money is expected to be spent on luring a medicines manufacturing innovation centre, developing brownfield sites for industry, improving the Bellfield Interchange, upgrading digital infrastructure and free port status at Prestwick , the Port of Ayr and Falkland Rail Yard in Ayr and a renewable energy hub in Cumnock. It is expected the signing of heads of terms - the stage when all the ious partners get together and announce which projects will receive funding - will be reached within several months. All seven of Scotland’s cities are now covered by the deals and Ayrshire is in the first wave of regions. The poundm for Ayrshire takes total UK Government commitment to pound. billion across Scotland.

Anyway, people who are confident of their arguments donrsquot run away from a referendum.ldquoBut maybe the people should decide through a general election.

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

I still have many of the books I bought with pocket money when I was young, carried through le like a lucky charm. TS Eliotrsquos Prufrock may have measured out his le with coffee spoons I have measured out mine with Puffins and King Penguins, Peregrines and Pelicans. If pressed, I could tell where I found each one.Like radio, the demise of the book has been often foretold. Books, we were unreliably informed, were yesterdayrsquos technology, so th century, so redundant in a digital age. I well recall the gleeful obituaries. The internet would sweep them away with tsunami-like ferocity. Kindles, apparently, were the future, and even I owned one once. Who knows where it lies unloved now. And who cares Similar prophesies of doom were made about bookshops, for what need was there for themno one wanted books  And for a while things did look a bit glum. With the demise of the Net Book Agreement, which determined that books must be sold at their cover price, many privately-owned bookshops found they couldnrsquot compete with the discounts offered by supermarkets and chain stores. Inevitably, sadly, some went to the wall or sold out to more voracious competitors.Of late, however, in what has been the bleakest of midwinters for the high street, there are signs that reports of the death of the bookshop were premature. In the last couple of weeks, I have heard of two new bookshops opening in Edinburgh. And last Saturday evening, I attended a mini book festival in Linlithgow, organised by the local independent, Far From the Madding Crowd, which was very well-attended, a testimony to the loyalty and warmth the shop engenders.The best bookshops are like that. When one of them is threatened it is a cause for mourning and resentment and the raising of petitions. For me, a town without a bookshop is unworthy of the name, a place where civilisation is yet to reach, where culture must surely fail to thrive. I have been in such outposts and nothing would drag me back.Where there is at least one bookshop there is hope. A year ago, I visited Christchurch in New Zealand, which is still struggling to recover from the devastating earthquakes of  and . The centre of the city was preternaturally quiet and the shopping mall was bereft of customers. But the one shop that was buzzing was Scorpio Books, also independently owned, which against all odds had managed to resurrect itself. Would the same, brave decision have been made by the fund managers who control chain stores  Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.One of the new Edinburgh shops will be Toppingrsquos, which has a wonderful branch in St Andrews. The companyrsquos founder is Robert Topping, formerly of Waterstonersquos in Manchester, which he left after being told to limit the size of the stock. The story is told in a new memoir by Glasgow-born Sir Tim Waterstone, of whom I was briefly an employee ndash the least said about which the better. ldquoThe Waterstonersquos model, recalls Sir Tim, ldquowas simply this: the highest class of heavily stocked literary bookselling run on a national scale by an unusually enthusiastic and highly knowledgeable young staff.Waterstonersquos was born in  when the book trade was in dire of need of modernisation. Complacent, rival shops kept short hours and unsatisfying stock, and their staff were more inclined to turn custom away than welcome it. Waterstonersquos ndash which was in the vanguard of Sunday opening ndash initiated a bookselling revolution and played an intrinsic role in making the literary novel cool. In the store in which I worked, on any given night you might catch a reading by Gore Vidal, Richard Ford, Raymond Carver or Edna OrsquoBrien. It was like a club of which anyone could become a member.Scratch any writer and they will regale you with tales of their favourite bookshops. I have one ndash Main Street Trading in St Boswells ndash a handful of miles from where I live in the Borders. Some prefer charity shops, others, such as my biblioholic husband, emporia like the Strand in New York with its eight miles of books.

A statement is expected this morning.The second demand is for a longer-term commitment to overhaul local taxation.The Greens want to replace council tax with a % annual property levy, and for councils to have far greater powers to raise their own taxes and set business rates.It is understood the government has agreed to discuss council tax reform, possibly through a cross-party forum, with a view to legislation by the end of this parliament.However it would probably for the next parliament to decide whether to pass any new law.In the short term, the government will also consider new local taxes such as a tourist tax.The financial and political demands come as a package - unless the Greens agree to the revised council funding, they will not get the tax reforms they have long campaigned for.Opposition parties said the Greens had always been likely to agree because of how it would look for Holyroodrsquos only pro-independence parties to fall out.Mr Mackay has also been under pressure to find a deal because the SNP has contrasted Holyrood stability with Brexit chaos at Westminster.A budget failure would also have undermined that message, as well as putting a dent in Mr Mackayrsquos leadership ambitions.Mr Harvie told the Herald: ldquoThe government has moved more than I thought they would this time last week.

One thing Simple Minds have done, which I have total respect for, is that theyrsquove never rested on their laurels.ldquoWe did an acoustic tour a few years ago which tied in well with what I did on the games.ldquoBut this has opened up a world of incredible young Gaelic singers and musicians who are confident, multi-talented iniduals with a real pride in their culture and they want their culture and their language to be relevant and used.ldquoThe idea of that community being represented in an Xbox game is great.

Or maybe it just does not seem fair to have a fight in which thousands, including a Cabinet Minister , line up against one -year-old.Mr Greerrsquos  minutes began last week after the Conservative Party sent a tweet to mark the anniversary of the death of Sir Winston Churchill, who died in  at the age of .ldquoFor many, the party noted, ldquothe greatest Briton to have ever lived. Mr Greer reckoned this deserved a response, as stated previously, and lo there poured forth upon his head much outrage, the stickiest of it coming from Mr Morgan, the host of ITVrsquos Good Morning Britain.The Scottish Parliamentrsquos youngest MSP went on GMB to defend his view. Rather brave of him, I thought. No sign of the Scottish cringe in this one. He acquitted himself well enough, with an answer for every point put to him.As Piers went into full Tasmanian Devil mode, Mr Greer, getting his retaliation in first, accused him of being a snowflake. Cheeky. When the MSP called a comment Mr Morgan made ldquowildly ahistorical, the host clearly did not know what the word meant.It was such a drubbing for Piers that his co-host Susanna Reid had to step in and save the interview, telling the MSP: ldquoNo one is denying that every historical hero should be scrutinised, but the use of the language is so offensive.Cometh the woman, cometh the point. While it is reasonable to appeal for some perspective on Churchillrsquos career, Mr Greer could have chosen his words, and his medium, more carefully.Just as children are told that there are outdoor voices and indoor ones, so there is language you might use in, say, a student union bar, or among friends. His Twitter summary was brutal, over the top, and yes, designed to provoke a response.Such is the way points are made on social media. Twitter is no place for reasoned debate. Twitter is where nuance goes to die. The fact that so many politicians, from Mr Greer to the US President, see it as a primary vehicle for communication with the public, is deeply worrying, and indicative of these populist times.So much for what he said. What should not be in doubt is his right to say it. Nothing he tweeted was against the law. As for Piers Morgan telling Mr Greer thatldquoit wasnrsquot for Winston Churchill you would be speaking German and goose-stepping your way to Holyrood, it is a rum do to praise Churchillrsquos part in the fight for freedom at the same time as condemning someone for exercising their right to free speech.Even the most cursory look at Churchillrsquos history, pre-Second World War in particular, would find him a knotty, dficult character with a long, sometimes chequered career. He was a product of his era, his class, his prejudices. This was well known to people at the time.By the s Churchill was considered a busted flush. Then along came another world war. People could appreciate his blood, toil, tears and sweat because they had provided no little measure of these things themselves.While they valued the role Churchill had played, perhaps even thought him a military genius, they were not above seeing him in the round. By wars end they did not regard him as the man to lead them into the future. Hence Labourrsquos landslide victory at the polls in . That voters re-elected him in  is simply proof that times change and opinions with them.The further away we have come from the Second World War the more perspective on Churchill has been lost. There has grown up an almost infantile desire to portray him as a saintly figure who should never be criticised. No serious historian has taken such a tack, but others have. Take the  film, Darkest Hour. Won two Oscars Gary Oldman, brilliant. Fine movie, right up to the scene where Churchill takes a ride on the Tube and is urged by men and women of all classes and colours to stand up to Hitler, to fight, fight, fight and never surrender.From there, the audience is led to believe it was a straight journey to Churchillrsquos ldquofight them on the beaches speech. What a great story. Except it never happened. The filmrsquos director, Joe Wright, said the scenes were ldquoa fictionalisation of an emotional truth, a way to show that Churchill could read the mood of the British people better than his peers.The trouble with history is not, as one character said in Alan Bennettrsquos The History Boys, that it is ldquoone ******* thing after another. That is a statement of fact. The problem with history comes when we accept only one version of an event or person, usually from the victors side, as the truth and nothing but the truth.History is a deeply political, and politicised, pursuit. How it is told,it is even told in the first place, says much about the times and where power lies.How is it the case, for example, that I spent all my school years in Scotland yet was never taught a thing about my own countryrsquos history The American Civil War. The Peterloo Massacre. The Russian Revolution. All of this, but not a word about the Clearances, the Act of Union, anything to do with Scottish history. Anyone would think there was a conspiracy at work. Perhaps Mr Greer, given how keen he is on history, might like to look into that.Read more: Piers Morgan clashes with Ross Greer"},{"url":null,"title":"bins to be collected once every three weeks in new council strategy","story":"Aberdeenshire residents will be encouraged to become recycling champions with the introduction of a controversial three-weekly collection programme.The revised waste strategy for all , properties in the Shire was approved in a - vote by the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee despite an alternative option from Peterhead SNP councillor Stephen Smith who said it was “too much, too soon”.From April next year, households will have weekly kerbside collections for one of three bins including a  litre bin for paper and card and  litre bin for metals, plastics and cartons.However under the new scheme, the existing general residual bin for non-recyclable waste will be signicantly reduced to a  litre capacity.Councillors were told by waste director Philip McKay that while it was a considerable reduction, the service felt it “should be manageable for most households”.He added that while a three-weekly non-recyclable waste collection might feel a bit daunting to residents initially – as did the move from weekly to fortnightly collections in Aberdeenshire a few years ago – experience from other Scottish local authorities showed that it is workable and can lead to a signicant increase in recycling rates.Mr McKay also stressed that given the larger recycling capacity provided in the favoured option, it provided “more flexibility in the future” for the addition of other recyclable materials without the need for additional recycling containers.Councillors were told that the scheme had the potential to save waste services £, per year at the lower end of the scale and even morethere was a higher uptake in recycling.However, Peterhead councillor Stephen Smith said the proposals as they stood were a step too far for North-east communities.In a bid to address concerns about the potential impact of any necessary changes to the waste strategy, he proposed that instead of using a -litre bin for three weekly collections, Aberdeenshire Council instead do what has happened in much of the rest of Scotland and keep the  litre bin for three weekly waste collections, with new  litre bins – which are expected to be funded in large part by ‘Zero Waste Scotland’ – being used for paper and card recycling for a transitional period.Councillor Smith’s proposal – which he claimed would have saved an estimated £, annually – followed confirmation from council officers that such a proposal would be compatible with Zero Waste Scotland’s requirements for helping to fund the cost of the new bins required.But council depute leader Peter Argyle warned against “changing horses” halfway through the programme as it would only lead to confusion.He told the committee that with an imminent landfill ban on biodegradable waste “coming down the tracks” by , it was “unacceptablewe don’t recycle” and questioned how people would be encouraged to recycle morethey continued to have the larger residual waste bin.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..!

Sandy retired as a Sergeant in Bucksburn in .Speaking about the celebration Instructor PC Steve Warden said: “We are delighted to have Sandy back in the unit today to help us celebrate  years of the North East Dog Unit. Since founding the unit, there have been hundreds of dogs and handlers who have all worked hard to help keep people safe here in the North East. We are a very special unit and we assist operational colleagues on all manner of calls from locating missing people, searching for items such as weapons, evidence and drugs and helping control volatile or aggressive situations. “Despite the many changes in policing in the North East over the last  years, it is great that the dog unit has remained and developed. We have a very strong team with a mix of experience but with the same dedication to the unit and the job. We hope that the North East Dog Unit enjoys many more decades of work.” As part of the celebration, Mr Reid has donated Rennie’s original collar and dog tag which is engraved stating that Rennie was owned by the Chief Constable of Aberdeen City Police and has been framed as a lasting memento.Retired officer, Sandy Reid added: “I have kept in touch with the Unit since I retired more than  years ago and it was great to celebrate this milestone with them today. The current dog handlers face much of the same challenges I did.

We are also very aware there needs to be some internal structural alterations.Given the urgency, the board is using its capital reserves to order the new air handling unit which is should be installed in March.ldquoIf the equipment breaks down between now and then, the pool will have to close, Mrs Manson said. ldquoSome people attend the pool on a weekly basis and that is what keeps them going. If it has to close for a number of weeks, it can make a real dference to their mobility and pain control.Retired GP Helen Charley, board chairman, said:ldquoHaving been a GP in Cromarty for  years, and having needed both hips and knees replaced, I am all too aware of how vital the Puffin Pool is to the good health and wellbeing of so many patients like me, she said.Established in  by Dr Malcolm Stevens, the pool has provided an average , sessions each year over the past four years.

Outside my window, in the grounds of the hotel – a -year-old maharajah’s palace, converted now to commercial use, as is the lot of many palaces in India – a peacock struts. Peacocks are the last bastion of unashamed, shamelessly self-advertisingmasculine flamboyance, but their time of reckoning will no doubt come. The peahens lurk in the bushes, more modest, more hard-working, I imagine, while their fancy partners draw all the admiring glances.Earlier today, on the Oriental Lawn of the hotel, a touching ceremony took place. It is Republic Day, the th anniversary of the promulgation of the Indian Constitution, a document that guided this vastly populous democracy through the sometimes trying second half of the th century and into its exciting and very dferent present. To mark this, the hotel staff, splendidly liveried, some wearing turbans with long colourful tails, lined up before a flagstaff. The national anthem was sung – rare amongst national anthems a lively, infectious tune. Then as the Indian flag, bunched up at the top of the pole, was released, flower petals fluttered from its folds, creating a settling orange cloud. After that, a tug-of-war took place on the lawn between, on the one side, management, smartly suited, and on the other the hotel’s security staff in their impressive unorms. Unfortunately for the security side, their shining black shoes had slippery soles, and they were easily defeated by the combined managers and waiters.: Alexander McCall Smith: Time to wake up and smell Europa’s coffee Jaipur has been en fête, not only because of Republic Day, but for the Jaipur Literature Festival, one of the most remarkable and magnicent literary festivals in the world. The Festival is in large measure the creation of three active imaginations – Sanjoy Roy, and the two founders, the writer Namita Gokhale and the Scottish author and historian, William Dalrymple. Willy, a member of a talented Scottish family, has devoted his le to writing about India, a country which he has portrayed in a series of works written since he was in his early s. His net has widened since the publication of his highly regarded White Mughals, with a book on Afghan history and a recent biography of the Koh-i-Noor diamond. He has also explored Indian beliefs in his Nine Lives, a study of the mosaic of religious systems that exist in this most spiritual of countries.Jaipur started modestly, as all literary festivals must do, but soon made its mark. Authors who came to speak here were taken by the extraordinary atmosphere of enthusiasm that prevails here. Le in India often strikes the outsider as being one great animated and passionate conversation, conducted at high pitch and with a gusto that makes the rest of us sound distinctly piano. The Jaipur Literature Festival very much embodies this with its massive audiences and the sparky exchanges that develop between readers and writers.: Alexander McCall Smith: Edinburgh Airport should charge people to sit downWhat distinguishes this festival from the numerous other book festivals on offer is its democratic feel. The events are free. There are inescapable financial reasons why Edinburgh and Hay, and most other UK festivals, have to charge for tickets, but there is something wonderful about people being able to participate in this sort of event eventhey are on a very tight budget. Jaipur is crowded with young people – students and schoolchildren – who are clearly thrilled to be part of an international event. As a writer, you are stopped at every turn by eager young readers who pose questions they have clearly carefully rehearsed. “What advice can you give me in the writing of my novel ” “What authors should I be readingI want to become an author ” And so on. When last here, I was approached by a young man who wanted to recite to me the poem he had written on the subject of Wittgenstein. That has never happened, as far as I know, to any author who has been at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, nor even at the Tobermory Book Festival on Mull. From that encounter sprung a correspondence that continues today.This year Irvine Welsh was in Jaipur. He has keen readers here, and they love him. They listen to him attentively, just as they listen, in the next breath, to Indian public intellectuals such as Shashi Tharoor or historians such as Charles Spencer. This is a very broad church indeed, no subjects are off limits, and freedom of speech is celebrated with determination and vigour. And the contrasts are striking. At one moment one of the stages will be taken over by a Bollywood singer who has written a memoir , at the next on comes ... well, that seems to be Jeffrey Archer, whose thrillers are lapped up in India. And next up is Germaine Greer. In the evenings the parties begin. Gardens are transformed by thousands of candles. The Indian moon comes up . A sitar plays. Readers, writers, publishers, discover one another. A thousand conversations begin.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4864375.1548783802!/image/image.jpg","title":"as a christian country uk should give asia bibi asylum stephen kerr mp","story":"Asia Bibi # a Christian whose conviction and death sentence for blasphemy has just been overturned by Pakistan#s Supreme Court # should be offered asylum by the UK as it has a duty to protect Christians from persecution around the world, writes Stephen Kerr MP.Our United Kingdom should be extremely proud of the role we have played advocating religious freedom. Enshrined in our law is the fundamental right to believe or not to believe in any religion without the fear of persecution. People from all religions live and work together for the greater good of our society. We are far from perfect though. Reports of anti-semitism in the United Kingdom were the second highest in recorded history in . There were over , Islamophobic hate crimes committed in  . Crimes against Catholics rose by  per cent in Scotland in  . There is a lot to work required to combat religious hate crime in our country and I urge politicians of all parties to come together and tackle this issue.I feel passionately about the subject because I am a member of a religious minority — the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — that has a long history of persecution and misrepresentation. Happily, those dark days are largely behind us, but the lessons learned are deeply ingrained and any suggestion of intolerance or persecution of any minority religious group or minority group of any kind is anathema to me.The first President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Joseph Smith, declared the human right to exercise “that free independence of mind which heaven has so graciously bestowed upon the human family is one of its choicest gts”.It is core to my religious belief to respect the religious beliefs of others. This is a respect that is enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human Rights which states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.”: Kirk calls on government to protect persecuted womanWe must protect this right and protect the rights of all faith groups and the right to atheism around the world. Within this must be a protection of Christians. As a member of the UN Security Council, our United Kingdom also has the moral responsibility to protect religious freedom across the globe. The persecution of Christians is increasing at an alarming rate, particularly in Asia where it is estimated that a third of Christians face repression. In China, measures have recently been introduced by President Xi Jinping which have resulted in worshippers being detained, the sale of bibles restricted, and the crucix being removed from public buildings. The Chinese Government has also banned Christmas in some cities.India, a country with the proud history of promoting peace and the largest democracy in the world, has recently become the tenth most dangerous country in the world for Christians to live in. A rise in Hindu extremism has resulted in a greater amount of violent attacks on churches and practising Christians. Across Asia and Africa, there has also been a substantial growth in attacks on Christian women, with higher rates of sexual violence, rape and forced marriages in North Korea, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya and Pakistan.The Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has recently announced a global review into the persecution of Christians. This is a move that I welcome whole-heartedly. This review will make recommendations on the steps our Government can take to protect Christians around the world.: Sentenced to hang: Pakistan Christian in blasphemy trialBefore this review is complete, I believe that our Government should signy our determination to protect Christians by granting Asia Bibi political asylum. Asia was convicted of blasphemy in Pakistan in  after a group of women said they could not use a bucket she had used for water as she was unclean due to her Christian faith. The accusers claimed that Asia confirmed she made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad to the group of women, but this was after Asia was beaten up in her own house. She was sentenced to death by hanging.After ious international campaigns, Asia was acquitted in October . The Government of Pakistan, however, signed an agreement with those leading the protests against Asia’s acquittal a month later which barred her from leaving the country. This is despite her family having to go into hiding. A bounty of half a million Pakistani rupees has been offered to anyone who can kill Asia. It is obvious that Asia’s le is in danger whilst she remains in Pakistan. With the welcome news that the appeal to her conviction has been thrown out, Asia will now be free to leave the country. The people of Canada should be proud that an offer of asylum was made by their Government after the original conviction. The UK did not make such an offer and it should have. This needs to change and a clear message sent that we will provide a safe haven for people such as Asia.Britain should be playing a leading role in protecting Christians around the world. The review announced by the Government is the first step in our becoming that. I look forward with anticipation to what it recommends but we must deliver more than words. Around  Christians a month are killed due to their faith and millions are oppressed. We must be brave and make it clear to the world that we, as a Christian nation, do not tolerate the persecution of Christians anywhere.Stephen Kerr is the Scottish Conservative MP for Stirling©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4865141.1548871339!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit barclays given green light to transfer 160bn to ireland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Barclays has been given the green light to transfer  billion eurosworth of assets to Ireland.The banking giant received approval from the High Court today for the move, which involves , clients.It comes as the company ramps up its Brexit contingency planning.: Brexit: PM wins reprieve but risks no deal with call for renegotiation“As we announced in , Barclays will use our existing licensed EU-based bank subsidiary to continue to serve our clients within the EU beyond  March  regardless of the outcome of Brexit,” the bank said.“Our preparations are well-advanced and we expect to be fully operational by  March .”The move is designed to deal with the consequences of a no-deal hard Brexit in which UK based banks would lose passporting rights that allow them toin the EU’s single market – the world’s richest trading bloc.In approving the move, Mr Justice Snowden said in his judgment: “Due to the continuing uncertainty over whether there might be a ‘no-deal’ Brexit, the Barclays Group has determined that it cannot wait any longer to implement the scheme.“In light of the large volume of business to be transferred, the scheme contains a number of phased dates upon which the transfer of the dferent types of business and the business of the branches in Spain, Italy and France, will become effective.“The overriding requirement, however, is that BBImust be legally and operationally ready to conduct all relevant regulated business with the in-scope clients by no later than  March , which is the date currently set for Brexit.”Several banks, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and a host of others, have set up continental hubs in preparation for Britain’s exit from the EU.This involves hundreds of jobs and hundreds of billions in assets being shted out of London, hitting the Treasury’s tax revenue and denting the capital’s reputation as a financial centre.Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of Brexit.For its part, Barclays will increase its Dublin headcount by around  to  as a result of Brexit.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4864513.1548837157!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian blackford scotland must have option to be independent eu nation","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNP#s Westminster leader infuriated the DUP in the aftermath of last night#s Commons votes on Brexit by claiming the Conservatives had #ripped up the Good Friday Agreement#.Ian Blackford accused the UK Government of treating the Northern Irish peace process with contempt by supporting Brexiteer demands to replace the backstop in the EU withdrawal agreement and called for Scotland to have the option of becoming and independent EU state.“Tonight the Conservative Party has effectively ripped apart the Good Friday Agreement,” Mr Blackford said.The DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds replied that it was “utterly reckless to talk in those terms”.Mr Dodds added: “Nobody in Northern Ireland, no political party, is advocating any kind of hard border in the island of Ireland, and we certainly do not advocate what others advocate, which is creating borders in the United Kingdom or ripping up the United Kingdom.”In the latest escalation of constitutional rhetoric over Brexit, Mr Blackford said during the debate the UK Government must respect a demand from the Scottish Parliament for a second independence referendum.“If our First Minister calls for a section  order, then his house must respect the will of the Scottish people,” he told the House of Commons.Nicola Sturgeon is expected to reveal details of her timetable for a second independence vote within weeks, with the UK set to leave the EU at the end of March.

Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4862285.1548404780!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond unique case is not unprecedented says advocate","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.If challenged, the court’s answer will be considered in the context of the publicity around the allegations. To date no case in Scotland has been stopped because of prejudicial publicity and that’s despite there having been some high-profile cases that attracted considerable, sometimes extremely prejudicial, media attention.These cases were dferent in that the accused were not well-known public figures, but it was argued that publicity about the allegations could prejudice any trial.I wouldn’t call this case unprecedented, but it has its own unique aspects. However, the challenges for the court have been considered before. Two examples are the trial of William Beggs for what became known as the “Limbs in the Loch” murder, and that of Nat Fraser, who was accused of killing his we, Arlene. There had been a great deal of reporting about the cases and the courts had to decide whether fair trials could be achieved. In both situations, the courts decided the cases could proceed fairly, referring to the safeguards of the passage of time between any publicity and a trial the focusing effect for a jury of listening to the evidence and the strong directions given to a jury in such cases to decide only based on evidence they hear in court.Those representing Salmond may argue that he is uniquely well-known and that some allegations against him have, to an extent, been canvassed in the media. They may say that it will be almost impossible to find jurors who have never heard of him. But that doesn’t matter – more to the point is whether it will be possible to find jurors that are untainted by prejudicial knowledge about the allegations.The Crown will say Contempt of Court rules apply and no-one can now publish anything that might prejudice the trial. There is now signicant protection in place and the media can only really report on procedural aspects such as the fact he has been charged.Very senior people at the Crown Office will be involved in decisions about possible proceedings once they have seen all statements and reports.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three.

A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

The  album release ‘Up Among The Heather, The Scottish Album’, reflects the Scots influence on their Northern Irish roots - the album will be released on tour. Last year, their previous album ‘The Unicorn, the Continuing Story’ gave the long-awaited sequel to their famed Unicorn song.BRAID DATEBand leader, George Millar says: “In some ways it seems like yesterday, in other ways it seems a million years ago when I first met and played with Jimmy . “Neither of us had any idea what could possibly be ahead of us. Tohome and play after all these years, will be a highlight of our career and one we’re looking forward to immensely. Like the famous Bushmills Irish Whiskey, The Irish Rovers continue to improve with age and The Braid Arts Centre and Mid  East Antrim Borough Council are delighted that the boys are making a visit home to be applauded for all they have done over the years for the music industry, and for promoting this part of the world across North America and beyond. Thursday March  will see the Rovers will be performing at The Braid and they will be guests of honour at a reception where the Mid  East Antrim will welcome them home.AIR AMBULANCEAll proceeds from tickets will be donated by The Irish Rovers to the Mayors Charity Northern Ireland Air Ambulance.Another great honour for the band this year was being recognized as one of these islands greatest eacutemigreacutes by Ireland’s newest and most state of the art museum in Dublin, EPIC Ireland. Museum Director Mervyn Greene says: “The Irish Rovers are iconic, world class and with very a long career. “That’s important to us in Ireland. “They’ve truly taken Ireland with them and shown the world.As it happens, The Unicorn album is part of EPIC’s Irish Rovers installation. As young immigrants, the Rovers emigrated to Canada and became so much a part of the Canadian culture that Canada’s Prime Minister Trudeau personally asked them to become full citizens so they could officially represent Canada around the world.In , The Irish Rovers had a breakout hit with their second album, The Unicorn.That album and the ‘lucky little ditty’ of a title track written by Shel Silverstein, took them from folk clubs of America to concert halls and television sets worldwide.LAST MINUTE“The Unicorn, which was in fact a last minute add to the original album, left us all with a tear or two, plus the unanswered question, ‘Whatever happened to the Unicorns when the ark left them stranded on the shore ” says George. Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production. Since the s, the Celtic super-group have travelled the world as musical ambassadors - with performances from as far apart as the Arctic Circle, Japan, and Germany, with regular tours to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.The Rovers first became known in the US in the s on shows like The Tonight Show, The Smothers Brothers, Mike Douglas Show, The Dating Game , and even starring in The Virginian.In the s they hosted their first of three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers Show’ and throughout the next  years their weekly television shows brought Ireland into living rooms of America and the rest of the world.More recently, their  Drunken Sailor album went viral on YouTube, made news headlines back home in Belfast and put them back on radio across North America with a new younger generation audience.A Canadian CBC producer saw the Belfast news articles about the Rovers new song and video and asked George Millar to sing his new song ‘The Titanic’ to help their telling of the th Anniversary of Titanic. The   Years triple CD broke tour sales records, while the lads ed to the small screen with three North American television specials, ‘The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland’, ‘The Irish Rovers Christmas’, ‘The Irish Rovers LIVE on St. Patrick’s Day  th Anniversary Special’, all produced in the last few years.The days of the long tours are finally coming to an end for these Irish lads as they are now completing one last world tour.

Our hard-won peace process and its political architecture have too often been taken for granted.We may have peace, but we have not seen enough progress.When over  Irish citizens from the north signed an open letter to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in December  it came at the end of a tumultuous and politically defining year.That January the Good Friday Agreement political institutions collapsed amidst the political and financial scandal of RHI.It served to confirm the growing view of northern nationalists that political unionism was not committed to proper power-sharing through the denial and refusal of equality, rights and respect towards the section of the community to which we belong, rights such as: access to justice marriage equality: language rights.It would seem that there can be no regulatory alignment on this island, and Bangor must be as British as Finchley, unless you are gay and want to be married or seek to live a le through the medium of Irish with statutory protection.This contempt mobilised the nationalist and republican electorate: in turn the unionist political majority in the Assembly was ended.Increased unionist belligerence continued, and then, the nationalist constituency sent a stark message during the subsequent Westminster election, that it was turning its back on Westminster.However, the political process in the north had already been seriously destabilised due to the result of the EU Referendum in , when a majority of people in the north voted to remain in the EU.The British government ignored that democratic result and the emerging negative implications of Brexit became major talking points across the island.Every report and expert assured us that there will never be a hard border in Ireland and that the Good Friday Agreement was constitutionally sacrosanct as an internationally binding agreement. Yet, within the past week, we have been told by Theresa May that the Good Friday Agreement is up for negotiation and the European Commission have confirmed that a no-deal Brexit will bring a hard border in Ireland and yesterday Leo Vardakar advised the World Economic Forum that there may be soldiers on the border.This culmination of events and concerns motivated me and others to make the first direct public appeal in late  to Leo Varadkar to stand up and speak out in defence of Irish citizens# rights in the north.We felt it was essential that Irish citizens in the north heard reassurance from the Irish Government that the reality of abandonment experienced by our parents and grandparents would not be visited upon our generation.The back page of your programme today carries an assurance from the Taoiseach that: “To the nationalist people in Northern Ireland, I want to assure you that we have protected your interests throughout these negotiations. Your birth right as Irish citizens, and therefore as EU citizens, will be protected.There will be no hard border on our island. You will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.”This assurance cannot simply be a historical quote.It must be a living commitment.It must mean that there can be no hard border on our island.That my children will not have to endure the ignominy of being stopped at Newry or Derry, when travelling to Croke Park for a match, or to Donegal for a holiday.One of the objectives of this conference today is to assert to the Irish Government that we are their citizens, bearing their passport and that we insist on our full access to citizenship, but rights, human rights are for all.No citizen in the north should endure a diminished sense of their citizenship as a result of Brexit. Everyone benefits when rights are protected, and all traditions and communities are respected and valued.Today’s conversation is about all of that. We seek to provide a space for a discussion to begin.It has to begin somewhere. And when we are told that now is not the right time, I ask then when is the right time. So,not now, when Nelson Mandela once observed that, “If you wait for textbook conditions they will never occur.”We believe this is the right time to have a conversation about the future. Failure to encourage and embrace that potential would be reckless and irresponsible.In the challenges which will immediately confront us in the coming weeks and months we will require a unied and coherent mobilisation of broad northern nationalist and progressive voices.Our children and new generations deserve a future better than the past which we endured. I wouldn’t have believed you, had you said a few short months ago that my small club [Naomh Éanna] would be in an All-Ireland final in two weeks time, but the unexpected can overtake events.I have seen how history and identity, timing and preparation and the taking of opportunity can reshape history and positively define and improve lives.Tapaidh an déis.

Written by Patricia Gormley and directed by Alan McKee, the play begins to a backdrop of Abba’s Money, Money, Money, as final demand letters are piling up at the business but Olive is keen to keep on trucking and put on a brave face for her staff and loyal customers. Christina Nelson plays a total of four characters in the production including enthusiastic but scatty trainee Jolene, nearby fold resident and ‘the road’ gossip Granny Eileen, Mrs Hughes with notions above her station and Cryin’ Air stewardess Cha Marie who has an imminent wedding to plan. Such is Christina’s talent to twist, turn, gurn and transform herself from a -year-old to a grouchy, rollator reliant octogenarian and back to the fur hat wearing, buttoned up Mrs Hughes had my companion asking: “Is that still the same actress ”What Patricia has created with her second offering is detailing just how much hair salons are part and parcel of community le. They are a haven for gossip, catch ups and for many of our elderly neighbours the place to go to for a hot cup of tea, their coat to be taken off and hung up and a weekly rinse and ‘set’ with the obligatory stacks of “lacquer”.Roisin and Christina work and bounce off each other brilliantly and there is a particularly heart felt and tender scene between Olive and Mrs Hughes that isn’t played for laughs as we reach the final, rousing act.Belly laughs, a few tears and rooting for the character of Olive made for a great night’s theatre and proved the perfect tonic as a standing ovation for all involved showed just how much the audience lapped up the story. We definitely haven’t seen the end of these characters.#Is That Too Hot# runs at The MAC theatre until February .

Within minutes of the vote SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the Conservatives had #effectively ripped apart the Good Friday Agreement#.DUP deuty leader Nigel Dodds reacted angrily to that claim, saying it was “utterly reckless to talk in those terms”.MPs earlier voted voted  to  in favour of rejecting a ‘No Deal’ Brexit.The vote outcome was met by a firm stance from EU leaders who insisted the Withdrawal Agreement would not be renegotiated. Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the backstop was “necessary” and “the developments at Westminster do nothing to change this”.European Council President Donald Tusk reaffirmed the EU position, adding: #The Withdrawal Agreement is and remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreementis not open for re-negotiation.#The vote has received widespread reaction from local politiicans. Sinn Féin MP Chris Hazzard has said the British parliament needs to realise that it cannot push the people of Ireland around over Brexit.  “What is happening at Westminster is clearly not in the interests of Ireland,” he said.“Instead it is all about the right-wing Brextremists of the Tory party who have been allowed to set the agenda. “In its desperation, the British government is trying to threaten and intimidate the Irish people with a hard border and an economic clf edge. “They need to realise the days of the British government and British parliament threatening the people of Ireland and pushing them around are over and not coming back. “The Irish government and EU need to stand firm against attempts to sabotage what has already been agreed.#SDLP leader Colum Eastwood hit out at the British government#s decision to #allow the dissolution of the Irish backstop# over the heads of people in Northern Ireland.He said: #Tonight, London decided that the interests of the people in Northern Ireland were secondary to the needs of the Conservative Party. The rejection of the Irish backstop, the only viable mechanism to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, is an affront to the Good Friday Agreement.#Let me be clear, the people of Northern Ireland did not consent to this. We will continue to engage with the Irish government to ensure that the backstop, as reiterated by Brussels, will not be undermined in the slightest.#Alliance Brexit spokesperson Stephen Farry MLA said Parliament has voted to send Brexit down “a dead-end” on the backstop.“Many people will be exasperated at a dysal Parliament unable to process and work through the real choices facing the UK around Brexit. Thirty-one months on from the referendum there is still no coherent way forward,” he added.“Those opposed to a no deal and alternative softer versions of Brexit are struggling to uny around an effective pathway. While there may be a majority for the principle of a no deal, there is no agreed means to stop it. By contrast, the Prime Minister has conducted a shameful u-turn on the backstop, and abandoned the deal she made with the EU only a few weeks ago.“Throughout the Brexit process, the Prime Minister and UK government have been clear they would avoid a hard border in Ireland at all costs. The need for the backstop only arises from the UK#s decision to leave the EU and the mutually incompatible red lines. At no stage has the UK government produced any viable alternative. And crucially, the Prime Minister did sign up to the backstop as part of the Withdrawal Agreement and defend its necessity. This abandonment of the backstop is an enormous act of bad faith and sends a terrible message to the people of Northern Ireland.“However, this is a pointless victory for the government. The EU is rightly clear the backstop and the Withdrawal Agreement are not up for renegotiation, and have indicated as such once again today. So this represents a dead-end. This amendment is therefore the ultimate unicorn, only serving to waste time and increase the risk of a catastrophic no deal crash-out.“There are consequences to constant delay and failure to face reality, as businesses and others cannot wait for certainty, and may choose to take proactive decisions which impact on investment and jobs.#"},{"url":null,"title":"eu has blown a hole in the backstop nigel dodds claims","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dodds has claimed the EU’s chief negotiator has “blown a hole” in the concept of the Irish backstop..pushThe DUP MP for Belfast North said Michel Barnier had said some checks and controls could be done away from the border and claimed that meant a backstop would not be necessary.Speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Dodds also accused the Irish Government of “highly reckless” talk over the potential of a no-deal Brexit to cause trouble at the border.He said: “In recent days we’ve heard the Irish prime minister talk about bringing his troops up to the border in the event of no deal, we’ve heard the Irish deputy foreign minister talk of people jumping out of windows – isn’t this highly-reckless talk extremely dangerous in the present circumstances Isnt that the way forward, and it blows a hole in the entire concept of this backstop Nigel DoddsFacebookTwitter“That sort of rhetoric should be toned down and instead focused on what Michel Barnier said the other day – that even in the event of a no deal we would sit down and find operational ways to have checks and controls away from the border.“Isn’t that the way forward, and it blows a hole in the entire concept of this backstop ”Prime Minister Theresa May did not agree that Mr Barnier’s comments, which also included an insistence the current backstop was the only arrangement possible, meant she could do away with the backstop and instead reiterated her commitment to no hard border.She said: “I will be speaking to the Taoiseach later today and it’s important for us to work with the Government of Ireland on the arrangements that will be in place in the future.“We obviously have sent a clear message from this House about what needs to happen in relation to the backstop but we retain our commitment to no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.”Mrs May should rule out a no deal Brexit, Labour MP Jack Dromeysaid, because it would be contemptuous of Parliament and impoverish the country.“We’re  days away from a clf,” he said. “If we plunge into an abyss our country will be a poorer country in every sense of the word.“Last night this House voted that there can be no question of a no-deal Brexit.“Will the Prime Minister honour the will of Parliament and rule out a no-deal Brexit because to proceed with a no-deal Brexit would not only impoverish our country it would be contemptuous of Parliament.”Mrs May responded that MPs should focus on getting a deal to avoid leaving without a deal.She added: “What Parliament also voted for last night was to say that it wanted to leave the EU with a deal and it identied what was necessary to change in the deal in order to enable that to happen and for the support of this House to be given to a deal.”SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused Mrs May of misleading the House with her plan to seek an “alternative arrangement” on the backstop, because the EU had already ruled out renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement.The MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber asked: “Has the Prime Minister inadvertently misled the House or is this Government’s incompetence reached a whole new level ”Mrs May said she was taking back to Brussels what was agreed by Parliament, and then criticised Mr Blackford for comments he made suggesting the Tories were “ripping up the Good Friday Agreement”, calling them “frankly irresponsible”.The SNP leader said that was a “disgraceful response” from a PM acting with “sheer irresponsibility”.Mr Blackford went on to accuse the Government of dragging Scotland out of the EU against its will.He said: “We are scunnered by this Government ignoring Scotland.“Prime Minister, do you accept that you have promised Scotland everything, you have delivered nothing ”Mrs May said a new report showed % of Scottish exports went to the rest of the UK, three times more than with the rest of the European Union.“Yet he represents a party that wants to erect a border between Scotland and England,” she said.“The biggest threat to the future of Scotland is sitting on those benches.”"},{"url":null,"title":"may urged to reach out across the political divide on brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

I would like to a substantial majority for a deal,” he told ITV’s Peston programme.While the Government remained committed to securing an independent trade policy, he said it was right to listen to other views – including calls for a customs union.“I think it is reasonable going into discussions to listen to people’s views and to see where the majority is in the House of Commons – and for a substantial majority.“I would want to see what proposals are there.

I can’t see that those technical possibilities are there yet,” he said.His comments came after Mrs May met privately with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn – who does support a customs union – to discuss the way forward on Brexit.In a further attempt to build cross-party support, Mr Clark – who has been holding talks with union leaders – suggested the Government could legislate to protect workers’ rights after Britain has left the EU.“The unions have some concerns that the deal that has been negotiated would somehow involve workers’ rights being diluted in this country. That is the opposite of our intention,” he said.“Given that is the opposite of the intention, it seems to me common sense would say let’s turn that intention into legal text – legislation.”Meanwhile, The Times reported the Prime Minister is preparing to woo rebel Labour MPs into supporting her deal with an injection of cash into deprived areas which voted Leave in the  referendum, including former mining communities.Thursday’s TIMES: “May woos Labour MPs with cash to back Brexit” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday pic WXXyIHcXQt— Allie Hodgkins-BrownJanuary , Mrs May is due to report back to Parliament on her negotiations with the EU on February , with a further series of votes by MPs expected the following day.Reports have suggested she could face a wave of resignations by pro-Remain ministersshe does not at that point finally rule out a no-deal Brexit.Asked whether he would vote to block no-deal, Mr Clark said: “I have always been very clear that to leave in a disorderly way on March  would be very bad for everyone in the economy.“I will do everything that I can to make sure that doesn’t happen. That is the purpose of having a position of influence in Government to be able to do that.“While you have an ability to influence those discussions I don’t think it is right to desert your post.”"},{"url":null,"title":"orange order launches newlook newspaper in belfast","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to borrow hundreds of million of euro to fund pay increases for nurses.The INMO has scheduled five more -hour stoppages, while the Psychiatric Nurses Association is due to initiate an overtime ban on

affected.Emergency and planned essential services were continuing while residential care was exempted from the trade union action over pay.Cancer surgeries have gone ahead.The health authority said it expected further disruption on Thursday because some who have stayed away from emergency departments on Wednesday may present then.On a normal day around , people are seen in the country’s emergency departments and  of those are admitted as inpatients.Liam Woods, deputy director general of operations in the HSE, said: “We are seeing delays and can expect further delays over the day.”Minor injury units are closed, which places extra pressure on emergency departments.Speaking in the Dail the Taoiseach said that while he could justy borrowing to save jobs post-Brexit or for capital projects, he could not for nurses.Leo Varadkar said: “We’re not in a position to borrow hundreds of millions of euros to fund pay increases.“I can justy borrowing hundreds of millions of euros for emergency measures to save jobs,it comes to that in the next couple of weeks.“I can justy borrowing that money for one off capital projects that will be with us for  or  years but I think borrowing money and funding pay increases with borrowed money is bad policy.”Mr Varadkar added that he profoundly regretted the action and he was sorry for the disruption inconvenience caused to patients.But the

representatives.“The belated th hour activity that we witnessed over the last number of days was far too little, far too late.”Mr Martin accused the government of being in denial about the recruitment and retention issues within the health service, adding that agency nursing was costing . million per week and that the country was “haemorrhaging” nurses.Mr Varadkar said he did not want to be put in a position where he would have to ert money that is earmarked for new medicines to pay for pay increases.Bur Mr Martin said there was “no limit to the budget of the children’s hospital” and that it was wrong of the Taoiseach to suggest thatthere was a deal reached with the nurses that it would be at the expense of medicines for patients.Sinn Fein leader said the nurses were on the picket lines because of the government’s “absolute failure”, not just in relation to the pay issue, but also the recruitment and retention crisis.Mary Lou McDonald said nurses did not want a strike but they had been forced into it.“They feel failed, they feel let down, they feel they haven’t been listened to and they’ve been backed into a corner,” she said.Ms McDonald added that Mr Varadkar had a duty as

It was designed around British red lines,\" he said.\"Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.\"However responding, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said delaying Brexit would not resolve the issues.

This is not just about Britains future. This is about how we work together in the future.\"He added: \"People keep talking about games of chicken and the UK position being against the Irish or the EU position. We are all trying to work together here.\"Britain and Ireland are two islands next door to each other, we have an extraordinary history at times a very tragic history. But we have to work out these things together and stop talking about games of chicken.\"Mr Coveney said he did not believe the only reason for Theresa Mays crushing defeat in the Commons earlier this month was down to the backstop alone.\"If you look at the withdrawal agreement it is actually not that controversial. It is about protecting citizens rights.. about protecting British citizens rights in the EU .. its about a financial settlement.. its about creating the time and space for a transition period.. for preparing for new realities.\"And its about protecting a peace process which I believe the Prime Minister is deeply committed to.\"He added: \"The problem with the argument is that nobody has come up with a pragmatic, sensible and legally sound way of avoiding border infrastructure reemerging between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. And that is why it took two years to get the backstop agreed and that is why I believe the Prime Minister is correct when she defends it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"key milestone passes for 1984 in orwellian mortality","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

expansion","story":"Ulster University has confirmed the purchase of Foyle College lands in Derry which will allow for future development of the Magee campus.It was expected that Ulster University would buy lands at the Duncreggan Road site when Foyle College relocated to its £.m Limavady Road site last year, however, the deal has experienced delays.The local community and politicians are optimistic that this will pave the way for long-awaited expansion at the Magee Campus which has seen a drop in student numbers and courses cut in recent years rather than growth.In a statement to the Derry News at the weekend an Ulster University spokesperson confirmed that the deal included both the lands on the Duncreggan Road and playing fields opposite the old Foyle College junior school on the Northland Road.She added: “Ulster University has completed its purchase of the Foyle College lands, marking a milestone in the development and expansion opportunities for Magee campus.“The purchase follows the opening last year of the £m state-of-the-art teaching centre at the heart of the Magee campus, which has already enhanced the vibrancy of campus le and paved the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.“Options for the Foyle College lands will now be explored in line with the University’s plans for growth of the Magee campus and its wider estates strategy.”Sinn Féin MP Elisha McCallion has welcomed the acquisition of additional land and says it is part of a wider growth plan.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe Foyle MP said: \"The expansion of Magee is one of the biggest priorities for the continued growth and development of Derrys economy.\"That expansion has taken a major step forward with the transfer of the land at the site of the former Foyle College to the university.  This land will be allow for the continued expansion of Magee.\"The key stakeholders involved have been working on the acquisition of this land for some time and I welcome the fact that it has now been completed.\"I will also be convening a meeting of all parties to meet with the permanent secretary of the Department of Health to discuss the plans for the establishment of a medical school at Magee.\"This is part of the wider plans for the growth and expansion of Magee which will provide more opportunities for young people and assist the development of a new, vibrant economy in the north west.\"Meanwhile, SDLP Councillor Sinead McLaughlin commented: \"This is a very important milestone as it reaffirms Ulster University’s commitment to the further expansion of the Magee Campus. The growth and development of the higher education provision within the North West region remains a political priority for our party as the university is a key driver for growing a vibrant regional economy.\"A key component of the University Growth Plan is the establishment of a Postgraduate Medical School. SDLP Leader, Colum Eastwood, has expressed his commitment to join a cross-party group to meet with the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Health to ensure that the Medical School gets approval to proceed before the end of May  as this is a critical deadline for the first student intake in September

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card.

She suffered from the heart condition Tricuspid Atresia.Mrs Trainor has described the decision to send babies to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool after the provincersquos paediatric pathologist retired as ldquoinhumane.She believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.In addition, Mrs Trainor believes the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.Addressing last weekrsquos meeting, Mrs Trainor described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service, knowing that a senior pathologist was retiring.ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le, she said.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.ldquoI am not sure what provision would be in place for parents to accompany the child, but to send them on such a journey is heartbreaking.

Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

If this is the first time you have subscribed to emails from JPIMedia Ltd, the publishers of Belfast Newsletter, please check your inbox to very your email address.  .html.valThe Vikings brought leprosy to Ireland, new research led by scientists at Queen#s University, Belfast and two other universities suggests.The finding is signicant, the researchers say, because so little is known about leprosy in medieval Ireland.Funded by the British Academy, the study focused on five cases of probable leprosy which were identied in human skeletal remains excavated from burials in Ireland. Three of the iniduals were from a cemetery in Dublin, while the others came from Co Kildare and Co Antrim.Genetic investigations, also known as genotyping, were carried out on the leprosy strains in two of the Dublin iniduals. The strains, which were dated from the early th century through to the th century, revealed that the iniduals had been affected by two dferent strains of leprosy. One had probable origins in Scandinavia, while the other first developed in the Middle East.The two strains are similar to those found in medieval Scandinavia.The scientists also examined the chemical composition of the teeth in the Dublin skeletons and found that two of the iniduals had come from somewhere colder, with older geology, than in Ireland – a good match for a Scandinavian origin.Professor Eileen Murphy, from the School of Natural and Built Environment at Queen’s, said: “Ireland is of particular interest in the history of leprosy as it was never part of the Roman world nor underwent any signicant occupation by later Anglo-Saxon settlers.”Professor Murphy added: “This work adds to our knowledge of the likely origins of leprosy in Medieval Ireland and will hopefully stimulate further research into the history and spread of this ancient disease across the world.”Belfast murder victim’s family need answers, vigil told Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NISnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayN.I. man headbutts police officer before spitting in nurses faceP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed. According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come. It’s time to put prosperity before party politics and dogma.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

I love the mutual ethos, and that we are fundamentally there to help the community,” she told Ulster Business.“We have to make a , but fundamentally we are there for the good of society. I passionately believe that home ownership is a good thing. And I passionately believe that savings are a good thing, and that’s what our business has been doing for more than  years.”According to its latest full-year figures, ending in December , Progressive posted pre-tax profit of £.m.In the last year, it helped more than , people buy their home and almost  to build a new home, with overall new mortgage lending of around £m.It’s weathered some of the most dficult years in the residential property market here, with Northern Ireland prices plummeting in the wake of the recession in .“We are battling our way through that – the housing market hasn’t fully recovered through it. The number of new developments probably aren’t servicing the needs of the demand. We still have an issue out there.“Slow, and modest growth is happening at the minute. But that’s good, and that’s sustainable. Affordability is very good in Northern Ireland and the economic factors, even with Brexit, are good.”Progressive now has  branches and more than  staff spread throughout Northern Ireland.For Darina, it’s about working hand-in-hand with the customer, and ensuring everyone in the team in the same mindset.“For me, it has to be doing right by the customer. Once your staff are fully on that journey too, they know they are doing the right thing,” Darina says. “They aren’t forced into sales targets – they want to get the right product fro the person, and making it as easy as they possibly can.“In part, to hand hold. There are some cases where deadlines don’t happen, things don’t go according to plans – for example, in a housing chain, someone can drop out. It’s about being there, and being able to help.“There is still a demand for people to buy houses – that hasn’t changed at all.”Darina took over at the helm in , while the property market in Northern Ireland, and throughout the UK, was still going through tough times. But she believes it has normalised since then.“Things are picking up,” she says. “We have the experience here to keep going in a direction that suits the demographic that we serve.“We are here for the long-term, and factor that in. Ultimately, it has to be right for the consumer.“It’s also about the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s not just Belfast-centric, and we have to extend our reach. There’s good activity in dferent parts of Northern Ireland, and that’s where our roots are.”And after more than  years with the organisation, Darina says she has no plans to jump ship to another financial business.“I am totally bought in to the mutual ethos. For me, it’s all about the customer.
